Wir verbrachten Ende Oktober 4 Nächte in der Sky-Tented Villa. Die Aussicht des Zimmers war unglaublich, das Zimmer entspricht allerdings keinesfalls einem 5-Sterne Hotel. 
Die Ausstattung ist eher durchschnittlich, wenn nicht sogar unterdurchschnittlich und die Klimaanlage hat zeitweise nicht gekühlt. 
Das Badezimmer, insbesondere das Klo waren abgenutzt. 

Eine der größten Enttäuschungen für uns waren allerdings der Service und das Essen. 
Uns wurde bei Ankunft ein persönlicher Butler zugeteilt, welcher allerdings ab dem zweiten Tag frei hatte und nicht mehr zur Verfügung stand. Der angeblich Ersatz reagierte auf unsere Bestellungen erst nach Stunden. 
Das Essen an sich war eher schlecht. Die warmen Speisen waren meist versalzen, in Hähnchen Gerichten musste man aufpassen das viel Knorpel und Knochen enthalten war. Das anschließend bestellte Dessert war Tiefkühl und nicht vollständig aufgetaut.
Auch beim Frühstück gab es Tiefkühlkost - so kam es vor, dass die Muffins die uns serviert wurden noch gefroren waren in der Mitte. Brot und Croissants wirkten oft alt und trocken. 

Uns wurde ein Spa Treatment geschenkt auf Grund des langen Aufenthaltes. Ein wirkliches Spa feeling kam hier in diesem Resort allerdings nicht auf. Das Spa war ein „Raum“ mitten im Freien, die Geräuschkulisse war störend. Von Sägen bis Musik von Nachbarn war alles dabei.

Das Personal sprach teilweise nur schlecht Englisch sodass die Kommunikation manchmal etwas schwierig war. Jedoch waren alle Mitarbeiter immer sehr bemüht uns jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen, nur ist dies leider nicht immer.

Wir würden dieses Hotel insgesamt nicht weiterempfehlen- zumindest nicht für diesen Preis. 
Zudem ist Lage nicht vorteilhaft wenn man Kandy sehen möchte.","Aussicht top, der Rest FLOP","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r978735830-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

This is not really a luxury hotel and definitely not a spa resort. It is really a collection of bedroom chalets in a very beautiful location with stunning views, if the weather allows. 
There is very little “spa” experience!  as they only have one member of staff who does the treatments. My husband and I could not ,for example , get a massage at the same time.
The massage room is located right next to a village house with a barking , whining dog , chopping and loud music , so it was not very relaxing. 

The location is not ideal for visiting Kandy . The trip into town took over 45 mins each way, so I would  suggest taking in the sights of Kandy before staying at the hotel. 

The food is good but not not amazing given the prices. I was charged 20 US for a large gin and tonic , which was served with a plastic bottle of very unpleasant  tonic.

The bedroom was very pleasant and had everything you need but I did not find the bed very comfortable . The bed creaked and the linen was an issue for me. We used the jacuzzi only once as you have to call the staff to get it working .

The main dining area is in the same space as the main Reception , the “bar” , the billiard table and everything else. So, on dining one night , a large van arrived with new arrivals right by our table and the driver left the engine running and the noise and the fumes was really in pleasant and disturbed the enjoyment of our meal.

The staff are really lovely and try their hardest but the resort??  ( I’m not sure what to call it ) is bit of a sham.  Go for the views and the lovely staff but for me, nothing else.","A big disappointment and not good value .","2022-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r826858825-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We are indeed surprised with this review. With the exception of an issue with hot water, owing to us utilising solar energy for this purpose, we are disappointed with the outcome of your stay. This too was rectified after switching to regular electricity. The comfort and satisfaction of all our guests is important, so despite the negative review we appreciate your feedback. 

On the issue of price, since you have mentioned it 2 times, please note that the price you paid is certainly not higher. While you stayed on a heavily discounted rate, it certainly has no bearing to the high levels of service or product offering we strive to maintain. This is aptly made clear by the positive reviews by hundreds of guests who we have had the privilege to host in the past. 

Note for future guests :

We do not serve buffet style meals, this is conveyed both at pre-booking as well as on arrival.
Lunch is traditional Sri Lankan or an alternate depending on guest movement.
Dinner is a 4 course international menu.
Breakfast is a choice of Sri Lankan or Western, which is a fantastic spread. We do not offer dessert at breakfast. Fresh fruit is however served. 

We are in the mountains, we are a nature resort, and our focus is on lessening the impact on our environment. Our villas all offer varied and individual views overlooking the mountains. We don't intend on cutting down any trees in the immediate future. 

I will be in touch with you direct.

Sincerely,

We got a warm welcome from the hotel staff and a quick check in to our room. After having a quick shower we went for lunch and asked for the menu but we were told that only chicken biriyani is available for lunch. We were told previously that they offer à la carte menu to choose from but NOPE. Good luck if you're a vegetarian and trying to have lunch at Aarunya. But the biriyani was nice, then again when you're paying a higher price, you need to have options to choose from. We stayed some time during the eve in the Jacuzzi which was the only luxurious thing that I can highlight during our stay, but being it an outdoor jacuzzi the magnificent view of the mountains were blocked by some trees in the garden. For dinner and for breakfast (no desserts were available for the breakfast) we had the à la carte menu (some satisfaction at least). The food is fine, but nothing really to highlight. The most frustrating thing was hot water was not available in the morning. At 7.00 am I called house keeping and informed, a person came and said he turned on the solar and in 5 min the hot water will be available. Waited 10 min, NOPE. Called again and another person came and said he routed the power back from generator and in 5 min it'll be available. Waited more than 15 min and no hot water and the water supply totally ran out, so no water at all. Called again and another new person came and did a fix saying they have two water lines and there is no water in the line routed to our room. Then it took another 10 min or so to get water back. So from 7.00 am to 8.00 am I was trying to wash myself. Such a disappointment. The staff was nice and have a nice view of the mountains for the main pool.

Thank you for taking the time to review Taru Villas – Rampart Street. We truly value the opinions of all our guests.

Having gone through your review I would like to start off by thanking you for listing the positive aspects of your stay. 

However, we do apologize that your stay at ‘Taru Villas – Rampart Street’ fell short of expectation. We strive to maintain a high level of service at our property and apologize that we fell short in this regard during your stay. 

With regards to the issues you faced, please note that our building is over 200 years old and had no attached bathrooms renovations and refurbishment. Since the property is located in a heritage site (Galle Fort) we had to follow strict guidelines when carrying out the renovations and this was the only position, for the bathroom, which was permitted by the world heritage site council. As a result of this feedback however we will be looking into the possibility of attaching a screen-like feature for privacy, without impacting the view of the garden too much or the architecture. Thank you for this constructive criticism.

As far as the electricity problem, power surges are unfortunately common in the Galle Fort and there is a delay of approximately half a minute before our generator automatically switches on. We are fortunate to have room enough to house a generator, a rarity in many (small) Fort properties where space is limited, but we do understand this time lapse can be disturbing to our guests. We are sincerely sorry for this inconvenience and while we appreciate the feedback we cannot currently find a better solution for this issue.

It is unfortunate that you did not have the best experience at our property, however if you do come back to any of our properties I would love to have the opportunity to speak with you directly, so please ask for me.

I look forward to meeting you in the future and wish you the very best.

The service and staff were friendly and accommodating.  The daily breakfast was a highlight.  The Galle Forte is small enough that it is well situated in the forte.  

We opted for the Garden View room which is more expensive than the pool room.  Unfortunately the room information on bookings website failed to note that this particular room has the bathroom detached from the room itself.  You had to exit the room onto your balcony to access your private bathroom.  During the day your balcony was exposed to the back of the grounds so you had to make sure you were adequately dressed to move from your hotel room to your bathroom.  You had to bring clothes in to change from showering or dash through the balcony in your (small) towel.  Also this meant there was no air conditioning in the bathroom and there were always mosquitoes in there so we found at night we were getting bitten a lot.  Lastly, as another guest mentioned there were at least 2 power outages in the middle of the night and so fumbling outside and back inside with no lights was problematic.  We noticed this was the only room that had this ""feature"".  The other 3 rooms had the bathroom connected.  We would not have paid extra for this room had we known this was the case.  This impacted our overall stay which is unfortunate. 

If we could give 3.5 stars we would.  It's a shame because had we stayed in any other room we would have given this hotel a 5 star rating. Other than that the room was very nice, spacious and clean, with comfortable bed.","Loved the Hotel, Not our Room","2016-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d9591203-r418348188-Taru_Villas_Rampart_Street_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We truly appreciate your insights as they help us improve our services and ensure a better experience for our guests.

I apologize for the check-in process not meeting your expectations, particularly regarding the lack of an escort to your room. While we aim to provide a warm and welcoming experience from the moment you arrive, I understand how it might have felt unusual to navigate on your own. We will certainly look into this matter to enhance our guest experience in the future.

I'm sorry to hear about the mix-up with your room type and the challenges you faced with the bed arrangement. It’s unfortunate that our staff member was unable to resolve this to your satisfaction. We will address this with our housekeeping team to ensure they are better equipped to handle such situations moving forward.

On a brighter note, I’m thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your dinner experience! Randil and the F&B team are indeed assets to our hotel, and I will make sure to pass along your kind words. It’s wonderful to know that his service made a positive impact on your stay.

We appreciate your understanding and patience, and we look forward to welcoming you back soon. Should you decide to visit us again, please do not hesitate to reach out so we can ensure your next stay is seamless and enjoyable.

Thank you once again for your feedback!

I had to ask for directions, and they simply pointed us to the lift, which felt unusual. The room itself was a bit dated but had the usual amenities.

We had booked a king bed but were given a twin bed room instead, as the hotel was fully booked. However, a housekeeping staff member attempted to adjust the beds by pushing them together. Unfortunately, he seemed inexperienced, as he was unable to properly fix the bed sheets and mentioned he hadn’t done this before, which wasn’t ideal.

On a positive note, the dinner experience was fantastic. The food was amazing, and I want to specially thank Randil and the entire F&B team for their excellent service. Randil was very accommodating and initially offered a complimentary meal for one adult, later realizing I was an in-house guest. His professionalism and warm service made the experience memorable.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate you highlighting the positive aspects of your experience, such as our convenient location, friendly staff, and well-equipped rooms.

We sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience you experienced with the check-in process. We understand that arriving after an early morning flight and having to wait until 2 p.m. for your room is unacceptable. We deeply regret the miscommunication and delays you encountered, including the initial lack of available rooms and the subsequent issue with missing bed linens.

We acknowledge that our service and hospitality fell short of your expectations in this instance, and for that, we are truly sorry. We are taking your comments seriously and will be addressing the issues you have highlighted as promptly as possible.

Hallo,

vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, Ihre Erfahrungen in unserem Hotel zu teilen. Wir schätzen Ihr Feedback sehr und nehmen Ihre Anmerkungen ernst.

Es freut uns zu hören, dass Ihnen die gute Lage unseres Hotels und die Freundlichkeit unserer Mitarbeiter gefallen haben. Auch Ihre positive Bewertung der Zimmerausstattung nehmen wir gerne zur Kenntnis.

Wir bedauern jedoch zutiefst, dass Ihr Aufenthalt durch die Probleme beim Check-in und die fehlende Bettwäsche beeinträchtigt wurde. Es ist uns bewusst, dass eine Ankunft um 7 Uhr nach einem langen Flug und die anschließende Wartezeit bis 14 Uhr, trotz Ihrer Nachfragen und der Bereitschaft, einen Aufpreis zu zahlen, inakzeptabel ist. Wir entschuldigen uns aufrichtig für die entstandenen Unannehmlichkeiten.

Ihre Anmerkung bezüglich des fehlenden Services und der Gastfreundlichkeit in diesem Bereich nehmen wir sehr ernst. Wir werden umgehend Maßnahmen ergreifen, um unsere Abläufe zu verbessern und sicherzustellen, dass sich solche Vorfälle in Zukunft nicht wiederholen.

Amazing spread. The food was super good! Did not expect that much of a spread for that price. I was definitely value for money. 
I my view, the food layout could have been better with a proper flow for the buffet. It was scattered everywhere and the dishes that were kept together didn’t match at times (I guess some miscommunication). Having said that, it did not have any impact on the taste of the food. 
I loved the Salads, Roasted/Grilled section and the Biriyani with Mutton Curry! 
We had two waiters serving us. One of them, a fresher from the Banquets who had come to help the restaurant, Jonath Thamiliniyan, who was very efficient, paid so much attention to our needs, did everything with caution, and so nice with a smile. I would say that is one of the best staff I have met in a hotel in Colombo. He should definitely be rewarded for his amazing attitude and dedication.

Unfortunately there was an incident that showed the flip side of Service by another staff member. 
Given that the package included evening tea with a piece of cake, we wanted to see how that looks like. The captain came to us and took our order and told one staff to serve us. Time went by, nothing happened, people who ordered after us, got their tea, and when we were just about to leave, this guy brought 4 cups of tea instead of 5 we ordered. All the tea cups/saucers had tea dust spilled all over. Some cups had half and less than a half. Only one cup had more than a half full. 
It was actually not tea, more like hot water with milk and tea sprinkled. For a permanent staff of the hotel, not sure how he applied the standards of an international hotel when serving tea like that. Utterly ridiculous and disappointing. 
If not for this incident I would have rated 5 stars.","A mixture of both Amazing and Crappy Service Attitude!","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306381-r944623418-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

I talked to all the Staff members at the Front Desk. They welcomed us and were very friendly and supportive. Among them, I found two brilliant staff members. One is Mr. Chamith Sarathkumara. He said he was the Duty Manager. He is an excellent young man with a lot of enthusiasm. He is happy always to resolve problems with a smile and keep the customers happy. The second is a young female, “Guest Relations Officer”, Hansini. She is a young, upcoming Officer ready to help Guests resolve any issues.
Restaurant
I am very disappointed with the Catering and Managing staff with the Menus. We had to eat “Kiribath with the same curries most days. Sometimes, pots are empty, and we had to inform them to fill them up. I think, “There are more chiefs and not enough Indians.”
Room Service
Another place with poor service. I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a “Club Sandwich.” When I rang them to find out why he said he had forgotten. Finally, ha brought a very cold club sandwich. The second time, when I ordered two club Sandwiches, it took 35 minutes, and it was warm, not hot.

At the dinner my favorite dessert Cream brulee was served without caramalized when I made an inquiry chef told flammbe gun is broken 😮 did not expect this from 4 🌟 hotel (Actuality 3🌟) I guess . Served half done dish ,maybe they thought that was the first time I eat this😁

After dinner a stuart rang the room bell saying that they cant post the dinner bill to room and I have to pay now I was so mad  as my kid also sleeping and had to wait by the door until he punch my credit card and come ,,SO rediculouse .

Most of the items on the menu were not available .

The young man Amit Kumar in the restaurant service was in particular very helpful in assisting us to plan our itinerary for sights to see. 
The bunkers housing an art gallery and museum was unusual and worth checking out.
The heritage rooms we stayed in had an old world character and were spacious. 
However our stay was marred by some sort of an animal  (cat?)  running around in the false ceiling of the room making a loud noise and creating a major disturbance during sleep time as well.  The staff tried but could not solve the problem.  This was unacceptable,  particularly in the higher priced heritage rooms. 
The restaurant ambience could have been better although the service was good.  The food was not great either, with a limited choice.","Good in parts!","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d12210527-r950536373-Fox_Resorts_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",

Placed in an excellent location, this hotel is full of local history, making it a one-of-a-kind place to stay. Although many view it as a luxurious hotel, our experience suggests it's more of a standard accommodation. Our room was quite basic and could use some updates, especially in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the balcony door lock was broken upon our arrival, but it got fixed promptly. The overall hotel area and the pool were well-kept, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The service, while friendly, didn't stand out as exceptional. 

During our dining experience, the waiter pushed the dinner buffet, but we declined due to its questionable value and selection. Unfortunately, many menu items were unavailable. However, we chose a curry, which turned out to be quite good. On a positive note, the breakfast had a wide selection and was delicious. We suggest exploring dinner options outside the hotel. Adchaya Pathra restaurant, with its reasonable prices, polite service, and tasty food, left us satisfied. 

What makes Fox Jaffna special is its rich history. The hotel tells a centuries-long tale of a home that has endured tough times, now transformed into a tranquil resort. While Northern Sri Lanka is definitely worth exploring, currently, the value for money at Fox Jaffna isn't quite there. Therefore, we recommend considering another hotel instead.

Good options for vegetarians are also, again, non-existent. If the chefs are not putting in as much effort for the vegetarians as the meat eaters, are they doing their job in 2023?

Night time buffet was so bad for vegetarians we didn’t bother to stay for dinner even though we had prepaid.

To the chefs: if you do 2 meat curries and a seafood curry, you need to provide a suitable vegetarian gravy option. It can’t just be dhal and the same side vegetable dishes that the meat eaters eat. You know this.

The service was good, but I found out afterward from a friend that they actually have a Michelin-star Thai chef who does tableside dishes.

Room supply like tea, bath gel and shampoo need to ask to refill most of the  day.

On the last day of our stay, my lady's foot was cut by broken glass on carpet. bad experience. Luckily, it is our last day.

It is a nice hotel, but need a lot training and attention to improve.","Nice hotel but need better restaurants and attention to detail","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r995050174-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The rooms are in dire need of renovation, we were met with outdated furniture, broken tiles, rusted bathroom fixtures, and stained curtains and bathtub – certainly not what one expects, regardless of price point.
Although the food quality was commendable, the dining experience was marred by inattentive restaurant staff. On one occasion at The Shack, we waited an unacceptable 20 minutes before a waiter approached our table. Furthermore, during breakfast service, we were inexplicably denied table service.
Ultimately, despite the appealing view, this resort offers nothing else that justifies its cost.

The staff are all very attentive , to add to the 5 star atmosphere. Nothing is too much trouble , and any issue we had was quickly resolved . 
We stayed for two weeks on a bed and breakfast basis , the breakfast consists of a really good spread of western food , local food and Indian food there's something to suit all the guests. 
The  chefs will freshly cook up fresh , omelettes, Hoppa's, Aloo paratha, Dosa's to name a few. And then bring them to your table .
There's only one pool at the hotel , and it never seems to be overly busy , a lot of people seem to opt for the beach instead. 
There's plenty of sunbeds to go around , either next to the pool , on a quiet area just away from the pool , or in the gardens with beach access. The pool guys are always there arranging cushions , putting up sun shades and providing towels.
If I was reviewing on just the above I would give the hotel 5 out of 5 . Alas the rooms let this Hotel down badly, which is why I only give the hotel 3 out of 5. 
The first room we stayed in for a few nights on the 4th floor was supposed to be a newly refurbished room ,it smelled very damp , all our clothes smelled of damp . The decorating left a lot to be desired, and some guests above scraped chairs throughout the night along the floor disturbing our sleep. 
I mentioned to reception about the chair noise in particular , and requested a top floor room so we didn't have that issue . We met the duty manager and he took us to a room the the top floor as requested. I mentioned the chair noise all night off and on and he said he doubted that to be true !!, I felt annoyed by his words .
We stayed in the fop floor room the rest of the holiday , it was a old style room in need of a complete refurbishment , but no damp smell and nobody above us. The only issue was with 3ft crack in the ceiling after a heavy downpour of rain , the engineering department fixed this by adding a large wooden baton across the whole ceiling as  a support . It looked awful but i guess it supported the ceiling .","Mixed Reviews","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r986795568-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I had requested on the very first day for my room closet clothes hangers to be replaced as they were rusted and could spoil my clothes that I had to hang on them. However, despite 2 reminders, they were never changed. This is not expected from a Taj group property. Breakfast area staff is very helpful.

The Chef and staff at Shack are amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Everyone has different standards. Somebody might feel that there were no issues to complain about, but that does not mean everything was perfect. There’s a big difference between good and perfection. Sometimes good is all we are looking for, and sometimes perfect is what we seek.
Let me begin by saying that what makes this hotel so special are the people that work here, so caring,kind, and considerate.
Yes, we had quite a few downfalls, but every issue we had was addressed and put right. This is down to a receptive GM who listened to us and made the changes. I have always found that if you have an issue, raise it and give the hotel a chance to put things right.
Even though I can not rate this hotel with 5 stars, the luxury is missing, and the hotel is worn and tired looking.
Little things such as cushion covers in the main buffet restaurant and pool sunbed covers which have lost their bounce and newness.
I am aware that this is an old hotel, as with older properties, ageing is one of the problems. It needs a face-lift, but this is being done as we speak. Rooms are being refurbished, and the painting and decorating team are hard at it.I have no doubt that in a few years, they will reach their 5 stars. But I feel for the money charged, it is worth what you are paying for. 
I praise the team for all their hard work, their humbleness  and devotion, and I would like to thank you for making our stay so memorable. ❤️

We used TUI as our booking agents. TUI put this hotel down as a 5 star hotel. At best, it's a 4 star. Why!
There are several reasons. Before I start, let me say that once the staff get used to you and you, them they are aways helpful and friendly.
When we first visited Sri Lanka back in 2021, we stayed at the Anantara in Kalutara, now that is a 5 star hotel.
These are our observations of the Taj Bentota:
1. The Spa is drab and dark. You walk from the lobby across to a decking that leads you through trees where you come upon a large fish tank that has seen better days. I'm amazed that the fish in it are still alive. It needs attention. The Spa is just to the left of the fish tank. The services offered are, as far as my wife and I were concerned we're average at best. You feel like they have missed a trick here as there are no creams, oils, or ointment  available to buy. The reception area needs brightening up.
2. We are both in our 60's and did not expect to have to climb into a bath to use a shower. The room was not good, so the following day, we went to reception, explained our concerns, and we were then allocated a different room with a walk in shower which was not available the day before.
This is to the staffs credit that they did this for us for which we are grateful.
3. Food, where to start? For us, the best place to eat was The Shack. It's a fresh fish restaurant and is the best place to eat as you can pick from.the days fresh catch what you want. We both totally recommend this restaurant. 
The Palms is the main restaurant, which everyone uses. It's like a canteen, and you feel like you're being herded in and herded out like  being on a conveyor belt. You also use this place for breakfast. Now I like Eggs Benedict. What I received was not. One of the 2 eggs was not runny, and I have no idea what the sauce was, but it certainly wasn't Hollandaise!
On the 13th, we decided to go to the other restaurant called The Oriental. We arrived at 19:10 to find nobody there, we waited for 10 minutes and then went to reception to ask if the restaurant is open? They made a few phone calls and then we were escorted back down to the restaurant. We sat down and eventually we had another really nice meal, but, only 1 person was there serving due to a function taking place adjacent to the restaurant, Why!
4. While the pool area is clean, well maintained and very good you cannot help but think if this place had full occupancy then there would not be enough room for everyone, yes the beach is about  50 yards away but not everyone likes the beach. For me, they need another pool, they have the room.
I think TUI need to look at their grading system as this is not a 5 star hotel. Room for improvement by all concerned.","Room For Improvement ","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r969662824-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The suite is extremely large but it was a little dated and had a number of issues that affected our enjoyment and comfort during the stay. 

The bathroom is massive however one side is open (it has a large outdoor shower) which meant it was incredibly hot, and as there were a number of heavy thunder storms it was constantly wet, with water running across the tiles and into other parts of the bathroom. It does not have a jacuzzi as advertised on their website. You are unable to keep the heavy bathroom door open, which was annoying when walking in and out of the bathroom.  

The plunge pool was a little dirty and quite cool compared to the amazing main pool of the hotel. Our plunge pool had an air conditioning compressor positioned above it which blew hot air across the pool. The outside area was partially covered but leaked in numerous places, which meant all the outdoor furniture was constantly wet and we were unable to use the outdoor sitting area at all during our stay. 

The plunge pool suites are positioned on the opposite side of the building, which meant no views towards the Fort, and to the see the ocean, you had to walk 15 metres to the end of the grass courtyard. 

Don’t waste your money on a plunge pool suite - go for a Premium Room with great views across the lovely pool, Galle Fort and out to sea. 

We found service at the hotel consistently good, including at breakfast. We thought the range of food was ok, but the quality was not as high as some other hotels we stayed in during our Sri Lanka trip. 

The hotel of the location is excellent. It is less than a five minute walk to the Fort which is great for sight seeing and we experienced some amazing bars and restaurants whilst visiting in the evening. 

The main pool is fantastic, it’s got amazing views and is of a high quality. It gets busy, which is to be expected due to the size of the hotel. 

I would thoroughly recommend the hotel, but don’t waste your $ on a plunge pool suite.","Great location and fantastic pool","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r1000202934-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We chose this hotel because of the proximity to Fort Galle and the views of the Fort were indeed fantastic. 
However before deciding to book this hotel you need to be aware of some things. You will not be able to walk to Fort Galle as the access via a gate is permanently locked. A tuk tuk will take you from the quite dirty entrance via a very busy road for about 500 rp each way. The staff at breakfast whilst very respectful are not very well trained and you may have to wait for coffee. Orange squash at a hotel of this calibre and in a country full of fruit!! There was one waiter who was very attentive but unfortunately I didn’t get his name sorry. Only 3 tables at the pool bar if you want to have lunch. 
Pretty but very small beach but no sun beds and the sea is full of rubbish. This is not the fault of the hotel and they employ someone to try to clean the area. Most people stay to visit the Fort so hopefully won’t spoil your visit. 
This is the worst part. DO NOT STAY IN ROOM 007. This is a delux room or as the reception kept pointing out to me a ‘basic’ room. I could go through lots of problems we encountered but this is the important bit. There is a metal door in the wall of the patio area. This is unlocked and contains outside work items used by workmen who used the patio as a short cut up to the pool area. I was told the workmen had been instructed not to use this door so why was it unlocked leaving us feeling our privacy and safety was severely compromised.

Not a ""grande dame"" hotel like the Galle Face in Colombo - it is more modern. It has a beautiful view of the ocean and Galle Fort from many rooms. 

It does have some real issues though that limit its value. 

My wife and I booked a jacuzzi room facing the ocean. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bed a bit overfirm but not bad at all.  However there was real damage to the ceiling in the bathroom and the staff seemed intent on making it worse, digging the door into the damage rather than just open it the other direction.  
The cleaning of the room was haphazard at best - dishes from room service on our first day sat in the room for two days and the furniture on the balcony was filthy - covered in dirt. There were also weird stains on the duvet. Blood? Food? No idea and they never changed it out.

Worst when we finally got to use the jacuzzi on the last night we had to jump out after five minutes. The drain and vents and deck around the jacuzzi were full of red ants. We were both bitten several times in just a few minutes. And when we informed the staff they seemed completely unconcerned. No apology, no ""we'll fix that"".  Literally just stared at us like ""so?"".

Unfortunately as previously mentioned in other reviews this location is let down by poor service and average food.

Our lunch was particularly bad. We ordered a chicken burger and pizza by the pool bar. This took over 45 minutes to arrive and when it did the chips were stone cold and the pizza cheese had hardened, presumably from being left standing in the kitchen awaiting service.

The pool bar staff were clueless on how to address this and sent the food back to the kitchen which then reappeared 10 minutes later after being “re warmed”. When we said this wasn’t an ideal solution the chef was dispatched to argue with us. Reluctantly he re cooked the meal, which was average quality at best.

I am specially writing this review to mention the excellent Customer service we received from Mr. Chamila & Mr. Alwis at the food and beverage section and Mr. Dinesh Kumar in House Keeping. Their service was exceptional and motivates me to go to the Le Grand again.  

However, we were little disappointed with the choice of the food. 
The Christmas Eve and Christmas day breakfast was good. Other days food selection was very limited. The management needs to improve on that. 

 In general it was a good stay. Very good rooms. 
But for sure the upper management needs to improve the food choices and give more variety.

Location is ok as very near to Old Galle Fort however the park gates are locked so you are not able to short cut through the park but walk round, not to far but past the municipal garbage! Of course not the hotels fault and a tuk tuk is less than $2 usd.
We booked the super deluxe room but it was not as shown on the website and has an enclosed bathroom. One of the most poorly designed bathrooms I've stayed in. No hooks only a rail on the toilet and shower door for towels, nothing for hand towels and no where to put your toiletries. 
The only mirror is in the bathroom above the sinks with nowhere to put anything...the hairdryer barely reaches  for you to see in the mirror and it gets hot in there as it has no ac in the bathroom.
No mirror in the main bedroom.
Tea is the worst and no tea pot...this is Sri Lanka tea country? They did however bring milk when we requested it for our in room tea.
Breakfast was a large buffet but not great quality.
So now to the positives, the staff are helpful and happy.
The pool area is peaceful and a good temperature.  Not sure how this would be when the hotel is busy as there are not any beds.

We recommend you call ahead and specifically clarify the ocean view if that’s important to you!

Food : Breakfast was excellent. Dinner options for seafood were limited. I had local seafood platter which was great.

Rooms/ villas
Clean and well kept, but substantially below the standards for a high end resort. 

Out toilet was not flushing and hot water system was not working. This caused great inconvenience for us on the first day. When we complained maintanece staff came to fix it, but they could not. 
Then they offered us another villa, and said it would be ready by 2.30pm, and advised us to pack and be ready. But it wasn’t ready until 530pm. 

Staff- 
Good and friendly. But they looked tired and exhausted. 

Front-desk staff- 
Mahendra was great and helpful but Govinda needs bit more training in customer service. 

Location
Excellent and unique

Beach 
Have access to 2 public beaches, small walk, west beach was very rough, but the south beach was great, and about 300m walk from that point another excellent surf beach, all accessible. 

Surrounding village
We did a walk bit-beyond surf-beach. Noted number of luxury resorts and the area has become very trendy!","Tropical beach holiday","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r985240259-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

However the main Terrasse restaurant is a disappointment, the attending staff is lovely, the view is once again breath-taking but the food is so called Sri-Lankan fusion and not targeted for western palates. Despite asking for no chillis we found ourselves in tears most of the lunch... We love spices, we just don't appreciate chilli that adds nothing to a dish flavors in our opinion. My husband tried with difficulties to eat his dishes when I gave up at the first one after 2 spoons in f the Melon soup ( previously confirmed with waiter - who was lovely by the way)- that it was not spicy /hot - explaining while taking order that we will choose non spicy dishes )
So when carefully selecting dishes and making it clear while ordering, it was disappointing to see the kitchen isn't able to follow clients' requirements. A pity for a Relais & Chateaux establishment.
It’s actually our first time having such an experience in a Relais & Chateaux restaurant.
Ended up the experience with a pushy cashier getting way too close to myself  while I was getting cash out of my purse just because you need to carry perfectly new USD notes with you otherwise they will not take it (supposedly a bank requirement. The notes were absolutely fine and I got so confused with the notes that he wanted to exchanged, the one that I already gave that it made me feel very nervous. It was a very unpleasant moment.
Overall, despite the amazing and breathtaking location, the lovely restaurant set up, and pleasant and welcoming staff (except the cashier) our experience was just a disappointment.","Restaurant at the Terrasse","2022-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r872069148-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

We have visited Resplendent Ceylon Wild coast a few times before this, so was eager to visit this property despite the negative comments we had heard about it.

The property is situated in a stunning location and the views from different areas of the resort were breathtaking. My wife and I wanted to highlight how much we enjoyed the food and the drinks at the hotel. Every single meal we had was very good. Ruwen and Sanka from the restaurant attended to all our needs and truly went out of their way to accommodate our every request.

However, we were quite upset about one thing that happened to us during our stay. 

On our way to lunch we asked for our room AC to be fixed because it was not working. When we came back It was still not fixed. An engineering team was sent to our room and their response was "" this is how the AC works, the hotel is a bit busy today so this is all the central AC can put out"". 

One of our friends joined us on this trip for the second night and we went to their room to see if their room had the same issue, however their room AC was working far better than ours. Later we asked for the engineering team again but this time with our villa host Sherom. Even he visited the room and acknowledged that the room AC wasn't cooling. However the response to the issue by the team was for us to open the doors in the toilet and the room and let the toilet AC cool the room. Unfortunately this was a really bad experience for us. A room change was not even suggested to us by them and I don't think even the GM was informed about this.

It was really unfortunate that this happened to us because we enjoyed everything else in the property but coming back to a room with a broken AC in this heat was not a pleasent experience. We were up most of the night due to the heat.

However, great property, excellent food and great service by the restaurant staff but I feel like our issue should have been handled much better.","Beautiful property, Excellent food but our issue was handled very poorly by management.","2022-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r825320465-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

I’m afraid I don’t understand your comment about depicting a wrong beach. We have two beaches, one on either side and always have had. If you would send me the image you refer to I will verify which of our two beaches it is.   East beach isn’t “very dirty”. Yes it is a public beach as all beaches in Sri Lanka are.

We were disapointed with 3 things :
1-The hotel could be located anywhere in the world it has no special local features except if you look in the dining room at   the niche for the lights which resemble the niches on the stairs of the temples.
2-We thought we would be 40 m above sea level, Wrong we were in part of the hotel which is located in a sort of small valley. None of the pictures of the hotel show that part!
3-The beaches : we could not find the beach which is on the brochure! There is an east beach. Out of the hotel . It is a pubic beach very dirty (battries, plastics of all sorts...) no service from the hotel. Across the road a annex of the hotel.
The west beach, very nice but you have to go down some steps and then only part of the beach is ""swimmable"" (corals) , no shade, and there again no hotel service.
The hotel will tell you that all beaches are public in SL. That is true but some hotels do have services on the back of the beach (lounge chairs...) Amanwella for instance. 
We were told that we could stay at the infinity pool....
We left the hotel one day early, I have to say that the management was good about it and they refunded the night that we did not spend with them, I thank them for their understanding. 
It is  a shame as we thought that we would be relaxing on a beach and although the rooms are perfect it is not what the brochure or internet leads you to beleive.","Lie by omission","2019-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r660375636-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

A lot of money has been spent on copying other All-Inclusive resorts that exist around the globe BUT .......   although the accommodation (villa) was huge and palatial the whole project fails in many ways.  If you are a holiday maker that does not mind paying up to twice the going rate for food (as included or to order) that is the same as that yards away and does not want any link to the actual country you are visiting then this place may suit.  Where money has not been spent is on staff training or to install any pride in working where customers are paying premium rates.  Is the food good? Is the position of the resort and the views good?  Are there plenty of staff?  Are there places to swim?  Are the villas/rooms of high quality?  All these questions I would have to answer, Yes.  Somehow though, the whole place lacks atmosphere and anything special.  Even by Sri-Lankan standards, service is completely haphazard.  One person will be energetic and, at least, trying to provide service for every three trying to avoid any connection with customers whatsoever.  Best summed up for me in that the villa had its own (shared) large plunge-pool and ‘Spotify’ available on the huge TV/Sound system but in the ‘snack’ restaurant there was little Sri-Lankan food, if any, and the guy that served us had started work an hour earlier with no training and, as a result, took 25 mins to get our food order completely wrong.

At night we woke up sweating, turns out the electricity had gone out. I called extension no.3 which was the reception and no one seems to be able to pick that line. Finally called operator and they had someone fix it.
There appeared to be something wrong with the phone.. because when I tried to dial the butler, it wouldn't connect as well. Not sure if these are problems only present during the off season..
Overall didn't really meet the expectations of other 5 star resorts, but was a pleasant stay.","1 night stay","2016-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r390437410-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

I'm sorry that you left Cape Weligama with mixed sentiments. Whilst taking comfort in the positive points you make, I am personally looking into the areas for improvement - corrective action has already been taken, such as increasing the number of sun beds by our spectacular Moon pool. The pools in the Residence gardens that require it will soon be afforded more privacy with new landscaping. Our duplex Cape Weligama Residences already have exclusive use pools. Luxury hospitality is relatively new to Sri Lanka and we do have the odd hiccup with the quality of English for instance. It's also been our first full high season and, whilst we fared very well as seen from the vast majority of responses, we fell short in a few cases which have provided useful learnings. English classes will be intensified for those staff who aren't yet proficient. We have sun beds at the beach club although it's set back slightly from the beach. We also have a new dedicated spa opening mid year. It's been 16 months since we opened and in the coming summer months I'm confident we will, as the pioneer Sri Lankan luxury resort brand, meet the standards of the long established global hotel groups you mention. Toward that end, your frank feedback is extremely useful. I will private messages you in case other suggestions come to mind. I do hope you might return to Sri Lanka and experience our next resort; Wild Coast Tented Lodge near the Yala National Park, due to open end year.

We stayed in the Grand Residence which was spacious and nicely furnished with a private garden overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately there was no private pool, a common feature in similarly priced hotels in Asia and the Indian Ocean. The concept of the shared pool didn't work well for us - it was situated just outside another villa and we didn't feel comfortable using it while that villa was occupied, which was for most of our stay.

Although there is essentially one main restaurant the food was probably one of the positives. There was a reasonable selection of dishes and cocktails with nice cold soups for lunch. The chef was very attentive and the service was quite efficient. The only exception was the afternoon teas - the tea selection was good, but the canapés could have been better. The service was mediocre at best. There seemed to be a different team of waiters providing the afternoon tea service with a rather poor knowledge of English.

The butler service did not seem to make much of a difference. Having a butler added no value beyond basic house keeping services and transportation around the resort. Speaking of service, we acutely felt a lack of a professional concierge. We've had the most appalling tour of Galle arranged by out butler. Never before have we come across such an unprofessional tour guide. We wanted to share this with the management team, but unfortunately they have not been available to discuss. Not having any meaningful engagement with the management in such a small hotel was indeed rather unusual and very different from our experiences elsewhere.

Even though not having a private beach was unusual in a negative way, the beach club was one of the nicer features, our daughter really enjoyed the activities and had a great interaction with the staff. Having some chaise lounges available at the beach would have helped - we've seen such service provided for hotel guests in public beaches, including really busy places like Copacabana. I guess it would have been a matter of not sparing a cost of few more employees. We went to Udawalawe and whale watching tours arranged by the beach club. We were largely satisfied, although considering the price ($500 for Udawalawe) the quality of the vehicles could have been better. Arranging for some nice snacks would have been a nice touch too, we've had Esyjet quality sandwiches, surprising for a luxury resort.

Public spaces and overcrowded adult pool were probably the biggest disappointments. Adult pool has beautiful views, but very little space around it. On more than one occasion there were no available chaise lounges. We were asked not to use the pool with our 7 year old daughter, but ended up using it anyway in the absence of other options. Unfortunately the families pool looked very unappealing, with no views and surrounded by rather grim looking buildings housing the smaller accommodations. On the subject of children, I would not recommend this hotel for families with small children. Spending a holiday with no kids club and around a rather depressing looking families pool may not be the best option.

The spa facilities were inadequate, a small villa was converted for a spa, so no pools, spacious relaxation areas, etc... They provide in the room treatments, but having it done in a bathroom with no air conditioner wasn't tempting and I ended up not having a spa treatment for the first time in quite a few years.

There is a nice potential and the location is truly beautiful. Having less villas and hotel rooms crammed into a relatively small space and more place left for private pools and spa facilities would have made for a more exclusive experience. Having a proper butler and / or concierge service as well as an engaged management team would have also made a difference.

We have been lucky to stay in quite a few luxury hotels and resorts around the world, including established chains, such as the Four Seasons, Mandarins, Banyan Tree, etc... Unfortunately with all the positives, and there are some, Cape Weligama comes short.","Mixed experience","2016-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r354432960-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

The rooms in blocks of 4 are  right by the family pool and not well sound-proofed.","Cleanliness","5","Service","4","Sleep Quality","5",,,,,,,"We spent 6 days here recently and sadly I think my review will be in a minority based on our experience.

Firstly, the positives - CW is in a lovely setting, the rooms are beautiful, the food is great, the staff are lovely - very warm and genuine.

We were in one of the rooms in the blocks of 4 - right by the family pool.  The room was huge and beautifully fitted out. We'd been on a wait list for a cancellation for a more private residence as we travelled as a couple without children.  Sadly no joy but we met a couple who booked only 2 weeks before arrival for the same dates as us, who managed to get a more private Residence.   No-one had informed us this room type had become available.  These rooms are great if you have children ... but if you don't, and are seeking peace, you should definitely make sure you get an accommodation outside of these blocks.

We had a butler who was very sweet but whose English was so limited, there was little point in asking for anything - a contrast to most of the other reviews on here.  We weren't told of excursions, timings for breakfast, etc. Upon check in, our room rate was incorrectly logged - not a great start when you have paid up front.  There was a catalogue of issues that I am noting with our travel company. It was 4 days before we saw a Manager of any description.  There is no information book in the room to detail what is where ....  I've never stayed in a hotel of this level and cost, and been so poorly informed.

The reception area seems to be manned by a few teenagers and a 'manager' of sorts - our check-out was far from seamless. That's another story.

The saving grace of this property would be the rest of the staff. The restaurant team especially were just so lovely - the chef's, waiters - nothing was to much trouble and they were attentive and charming. The food was great too.  Afternoon tea every day was a lovely touch, again with perfect service.  

I think the management presence and modus operandi needs to tighten up - the staff are great - but cohesion and clarity for guests is much needed for it to be under the Relais Chateau name.","So much right but far from perfect ...","2016-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r352357262-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Having flown into Colombo a few days prior, the pictures and prospect of a luxury stay by the beach was incredibly enticing.

On arrival, there was great promise of the type of service and standards we expected. We were warmly greeted with cold towels and refreshing fruit sorbets - very welcome in the heat. Our butler then introduced himself and escorted us around the property and on to our Residence Villa. 

The property is stunning, set on a cliff top overlooking Weligama bay. It's an architectural delight and well appointed. Our villa was really beautiful too. The manager made himself known and chatted with us at mealtimes, which was also nice. 

So where did our stay go wrong? Mainly we found service and attention to detail could be vastly improved. Here's why:
- our butler was a nice man, but he didn't explain anything to us properly. For example, on our tour of the property he should have told us more about amenities and services available. 
- a cot was requested a few days prior to our arrival. When we reached, there was no cot set up in our room. Once it was set up, it required another call and another wait for bedding to arrive. 
- same when I requested milk and meals for our toddler. Despite placing the request several hours earlier for a specific time, it was always brought late to the room. 
- where was the afternoon tea that I had read about? Again, we weren't sure if this was included as part of our stay (a regular feature in other hotels of a similar standard). Well we didn't get it on the first day and there was no mention of it on the second either - although we chose to spend the day out. 
- the food was mediocre, Sri Lankan dishes not very authentic. The spices are severely toned down to appease Western palates, but I don't believe that every dish should have been so bland. The chef on the other hand was a delight - he happily obliged our requests to turn up the heat for dishes we ordered. Hoppers on the Friday night were also not good - they were flat and doughy with no crispness. Breakfast was better. 
- Turn down service had to be requested and in fact, we went without on the first night as our toddler was already asleep by 7.30pm. A 2-point plug vaporiser for mosquitos is provided for a room that is only equipped with 3-point plugs. Again, yet another phone call to be made. 
- speaking of turn down, there is nothing placed as a special treat in the room. No petit fours, no fruit basket, toiletries, nothing! Not asking for towels to be sculpted but a little something is again a standard in any hotel! 
- also note that a pool is shared between 3 residence villas, it's not completely private for your own use. 

Additionally, we never really heard from our butler. Whether to organise excursions or if we had any special requests, we never received that type of personalised service. We treat ourselves to a couple of luxury retreats every year, mainly around South East Asia and each time, have been blown away by the standards and attention of staff. Sadly not here.

Cape Weligama is a very beautiful place with warm and friendly staff; but has far to go to reach a level of service expected in a luxury retreat of this category, despite charging prices that are on par (or above) similar resorts in Bali and Vietnam.

So we decided to try the new addition to this chain.

On arrival there was such promise. The site is spectacular. The buildings are just beautiful. The master suite we stayed at huge, beautifully appointed and finished with great love and care. The room phone did not work and I could not log into the WIFI, no issue the in house IT man came and sorted it out. Now where do you get this kind of service?

Then we hit the restaurant! I ordered a beef burger, which was just dreadful. The pattie had absolutely no seasoning, which would have been fine if the beef had flavour. The Crepe I had for dessert was a really thick pancake.

Afternoon tea again served beautifully and with divine pastries. Shame about the stone cold scones that were dry as the Sahara dessert.

At dinner we were encouraged (Strongly!) to eat at the buffet which really was a sorry sight for a US $940/night all inclusive stay. We asked foe the A La Carte. The coconut crumbed prawns were shrimps drawing in oil and batter. The steak was much better for the main as was the dessert of cold strawberry soufle.

Breakfast was another disappointment. Again actively encouraged to the buffet, again a sad sight. Stuck with the A La Carte with consequences. The croissants were stone cold. The eggs Benedict was on a muffin that was rock hard and that had clearly been defrosted in a rush. My partners Sri Lankan omelet had no spice in spite of him asking for extra chilli. The Passion fruit and Mango Smoothie never arrived.

This is meant to be a Relais and Chateaux property which it currently clearly is not. Such a shame, stunning pools, gardens would work perfectly with a functioning kitchen.....

Unlike most beach hotels with which we Sri Lankans are familiar, one cannot step out of your room or hotel lawn into the sea but rather, must content oneself with contemplating sweeping, azure horizons and the rippling, rolling, sonorous surf from afar. Not surprisingly, it is this height and distance that proffers a breathtaking vista and architect Lek Bunnag must be congratulated for cleverly positioning the villas so that each affords a different view of the ocean while simultaneously providing privacy to the occupants. The panorama from the bed on the upper floor of the Joris van Spillbergen villa was especially magical.

The villas themselves are a study in opulence and comfort, with the bathroom almost equalling the size of the bedroom! Your very own butler is also on hand to cater to your slightest whim. However, I sorely missed the spare, clean lines I have come to associate with most Sri Lankan boutique hotels and villas designed by renowned local architects –both Bawa and beyond—that stimulate ones aesthetic sensibilities at every glance and turn; I have often strolled down a path or corridor and been stopped short by the sheer beauty of the architectural form and the elegant configuration of interiors and exteriors. Not so at Cape Weligama, unfortunately. In fact, the reception area was particularly hideous and uninviting. The only interesting architectural feature was the installation of drop down guttering that must conjure up sweet music when it rains.

The greatest disappointment at Cape Weligama was the food. I hasten to add that I only had one meal, lunch, as we were pressed for time but it was singularly unexceptional and so exorbitantly priced (US$60 per person) for what was on offer that I don’t think I shall return to this hotel no matter how stunning the views are from its dining deck or concave, salt water pool. 

My friend Minnie had been promised ‘fine dining’ by Manager Kosala so we sat down for a rather late lunch with great anticipation. Sadly, the menu offered up the usual clichés --your basic burgers, some pasta, a couple of dishes infused with Sri Lankan spices and a few others that echoed Thai dishes. Most surprisingly, there was no seafood on the menu with the exception of a tiny slab of barramundi slathered in ‘curry’ sauce. One member of our party did find the Thai beef salad appetizer very tender and succulent and Minnie’s Thai papaya salad appetizer provided a wondrous burst of flavor but my cold pineapple and coconut soup was too sweet and had an unpleasant aftertaste. All the mains were mediocre –my grilled vegetable and feta wrap was indistinguishable from ones I’ve eaten in hole-in-the wall cafés in Colombo. The desserts were similarly unimaginative. Thankfully, this uninspiring repast was mitigated by a delicious dinner at Café Ceylon, a few kilometres away, for ¼ the price of our lunch.","Spectacular views but mediocre food","2015-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r285071679-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

We were greeted on arrival by the Manager and offered a welcome drink. It was very quiet when we arrived, we did not see any other guests or staff, so we did not know what to expect. We were not required to formally check-in as with other hotels/resorts and were shown to our room by the resort's Housekeeper. 

This resort is very much back to basics, it is calm and peaceful. We enjoyed hearing and seeing the donkeys around the resort, as well as the dogs and a cat who were usually around the dining area/beach. We found that the staff were very friendly but generally kept to themselves. The staff were kind enough to provide fresh milk for our tea and to check in on us when we skipped dinner on our first night after having a heavy lunch before arriving at the resort. 

We were not informed of any activities available at the resort but there is a board with a list of activities next to the Reception, so we assumed you would have to enquire yourself if you were interested in any. We were there to relax, so this was not really an issue for us although I do think some conversation from staff may entice guests to try something new while at the resort! 

The tide was rough when we visited, so we could not go into the sea but we did enjoy walks along the beach after breakfast. The swimming pool and view of the sea was lovely and the sunbeds provided were comfortable to relax on. The room's outdoor shower was very nice and worked well, toiletries provided were OK. The breakfast and dinner buffets were limited but were generally tasty and sufficient to keep you full till the next meal. We had lunch from the A La Carte menu on our second day and enjoyed the poke bowl and chicken burger with chips. We also ordered mocktails, which were very nice. 

It was very hot when we visited and the ceiling fan would not have been sufficient by itself, fortunately we found another fan upstairs in our room. We were also advised not to flush any tissue down the toilet, instead a bin is provided for you to place your tissue after use - this was a reminder that we were staying in an eco friendly resort! We generally enjoyed our stay and would consider revisiting and possibly trying kite surfing or paddleboarding, which the resort seems to be well known for and may enhance our experience at the resort!","Something different...","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r970998867-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Thanks a lot for your detailed and honest review. We highly appreciate all of your feedback.

- Room/Bed size for 4 people: I see you were staying in a round Villa. You are absolutely right that the two beds upstairs are not really made for 2 adults, especially not in the round villa. In the rectangular there is a bit more space upstairs. I will instruct our staff/management to accommodate 4 people only in the rectangular villas and to inform the guests before the stay that the space is limited upstairs.

- Shower/hot water: I just instructed the staff to check this and take action accordingly.

- Number of sun beds: Noted and you are absolutely right, that we don't have 20 sun beds around the pool. Normally never more than half of the guests use the pool beds at the same time, but as we are growing again at this moment this will be brought forward by me at the next meeting which takes place later this month, so we can invest there.

- Breakfast & dinner: Both are included in the room charge as you state correctly. That the food is not hot is not the standard that we aim for. Will definitely take action there. Also you should definitely be welcome to eat later if you desire to do so. 

- Attention to the detail: I know about that and it is the hardest part currently as an owner if you cannot be on the spot yourself at all times. However this shall not be an excuse and also here: Thanks for telling it.

Summarized: All points noted and taken seriously. I hope that despite these weak points you enjoyed your stay!

Thank you and best regards

They try to be eco friendly so rooms do not have AC, and they provide glass water bottles that they refill each day from a large water bottle to reduce plastic use, which is to be applauded. 

While the rooms are generally adequate, the villas are sold as fit for 4 adults - with a king size bed and 2 single beds. This is a bit of a stretch as, in reality, the single beds are only useful for younger children; they certainly were not really big enough for our two sons aged 17 and 19. 

Others have commented that the waterfall shower is good. I agree that it is a good idea as a concept. However, the water seems to be heated from solar panels but the water in our villa was not hot at any time of day that we tried to use it, so our waterfall shower was in reality a cold water shower. 

During our stay there were 21 guests, but the resort cannot really cater for this number, as there are insufficient sun loungers around the pool or on the beach for this many guests, and in any event those around the pool are not fully shaded. The resort needs to invest in more sun loungers to match with the number of guests that the rooms can accommodate. 

Perhaps the area most in need of improvement is the food. The breakfast is charged at Rs1400 and the dinner at Rs2100 (plus 10%), which is far too much for the quality available (though both were included in our room rate). The meals are buffet style and if you aren’t there when they bring the food out (8am for breakfast and 7pm for dinner) they sometimes run out before you’ve eaten.  

At lunch we ordered a number of dishes, including the chicken kotthu, which arrived cold. We sent it back asking for it to be warmed up but it was returned - still cold - with the explanation that they couldn’t use the oven as it blew the fuses if they tried to do so. I would have expected them to take things off the menu if they couldn’t serve hot meals hot, rather than serve them cold - particularly as it was twice the price of any other kotthu any of us have eaten during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka. 

As mentioned at the start, however, the surroundings are magnificent. The resort just needs a bit of attention to detail and improved food to be considered value for money.

I have noted the weak points that you listed. It should really not be the way as you describe it with regard to breakfast and dinner times and no way should anybody feel like being under pressure to finish the meal and leave for the room again. I take this issue very serious and will look into this.

Regarding yoga and massage: We had it on our website in the past as we had a yoga instructor on site and an ayurvedic doctor on request, but we removed it quite some time ago. I just saw that on TripAdvisor we still had some images of ayurvedic treatment. I just removed them. Can you tell us where yoga & massages were advertised? It would help us to remove misleading information.

Thank you very much for your review. Good to hear that you had a good time at Elements. 

Let me briefly address the issues that you experienced:

Positions and pricing:
While pricing as a very delicate yet important topic, we continuously aim at at good balance between product and price. Our presently greatest difficulty there is our relatively small size hotel (10 rooms) coupled with its relative remoteness that raises the total cost per room. We constantly try to make the guest feel that the stay is worth the money. Compared with hotels in the area with a similar product (Bar Reef Resort, Ruwala Resort, Dolphin Beach Resort) we are in about the same price range.

Machinery at the beach:
Since many years the coast at Kappalady (Elements beach) is suffering heavy erosion. At the Elements we have lost approx. 40 meters of beach since 2007. We are happy that the Coast Conservation Department of Sri Lanka has approved the installation of 4 breaks to stop the erosion. Unfortunately that work was still in progress when you were at Elements. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. However it will be of great value for all of our future guest.

Billing/Checkout:
Thank you for this feedback. I will take initiative to speed up the checkout process and have it done accurately.

Thanks for your time to rate and review our place!

We came specifically to kitesurf and weren't disappointed as both the wind and location is great. Fantastic flat lagoons with lots of space and the ocean side is also good.

The Staff were amazingly friendly and really looked after us and the chef and food at dinner was excellent.

The biggest problem in the positioning and the price. It is pretty expensive to stay there, and whilst previous review responses say it is not a kite-camp but rather a boutique resort, it really is somewhere in the middle. We have stayed at far nicer 'camps' with better breakfasts (breakfast is very basic), bar etc for a fraction of the price. The accommodation is however very good and certainly 'boutique' with big rooms and lovely outdoor showers.

The one thing that has made us rate it a 3 rather than a 4 is that the beach and restaurant had heavy machinery (diggers and a truck) continually going up and down the beach all day long. This really spoiled the peace and was non stop noise (they were building sea walls). Also be prepared for some noise/bangs in the mornings as there is a military testing ground nearby!

Also be sure to check your bill as ours (and others staying at the time) was wrong and the guy doing the invoicing seemed not to have a record of our booking or deposit payments! It took a while to sort out!

All of this considered, I would still recommend visiting for the kiting as it's a truly great location and even though we've given it 3/5, we would probably go back for this alone.

Buggy is unreliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"To start off, the pluses - beautiful property, spacious rooms and well intentioned staff. The rooms overlook the tea estate and has a gorgeous view of the estates and a huge balcony to enjoy it. We stayed in a premium signature room. The food, service staff at restaurant were solid..so was the breakfast.

Now for the not so good - there was a rain shower which knocked down the internet, phone and TV! Which meant, there was no way to connect with the lobby or get help. We were passed from person to person and spent 530-730 pm fixing the issues, which left us all with a headache. Problem was not the issue but the fact that nobody took responsibility to fix it, nor did we get an eta on when it will be fixed. 

Second, there are a lot of fixable issues - no sign boards on property, understaffed which meant no buggy service post 10 pm and before 6:30 am! No public telephones (everything was IP phones). 

The swimming pool is down for renovation and they give access to Ravana pool, but it’s not a place for kids (hikers come to Ravana pool to get drunk and hang in the pool). Also the buggy cannot reach Ravana due to poor roads! So it’s not really a replacement pool. 

So overall, would I recommend? At this price (500 usd a night), not really. At that price and in Sri Lanka, I would expect top notch service that did not happen. The front office manager did his best to assuage with a small discount but that doesn’t cut it for a supposedly 5 star property.","Nice property with more misses than hits!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1008781632-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The location is stunning. Not only does it have unmatched views over the valley but it is perfectly positioned to walk to mini Adams Peak and 9 arches. Far enough from the bustle of Ella but close enough to get to and from with ease. Also the prices for rooms are at the bottom end of SL 5 star level. Lastly the welcome and leaving ceremonies are touching and well constructed. However when choosing this hotel you should be aware that the rooms are pretty basic -  Linda leave a lot of light, no air con and very simple furniture. Likewise the food and drinks were medium quality at best. It’s not necessarily a bad Ella option but know what you are getting.","3 Star Vibe in 5 Star Location","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1000352175-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize for the power interruptions during your stay, which were caused by the unpredictable weather in Sri Lanka. However, we want to assure you that our generator kicks in within 35 seconds to minimize any inconvenience. If we experience continuous power drops, we will keep the generator running to improve the guest experience.

We understand your concern about the cost of the cashew nuts, and we’ll take your feedback into account to review pricing and see if adjustments are possible.

Regarding the Ravana Pool Club, it is indeed a separate entity, though owned by the same company. As a gesture for our in-house guests, we offer a 10% discount at the club. However, we also have a beautiful pool on the resort premises that is available to guests at no extra charge.

We believe the spa prices are fair for the quality of service provided, but we do not typically offer discounts unless it's unbearable to the guest to enjoy the service otherwise.

We appreciate your comments and will work on making improvements where we can.

The deluxe room is very similar to much more reasonably priced hotels. King size bed, shower etc.,  
The electric here is terrible, constantly cutting out which means that the fan stops working when it switched to the generator and the consumer unit beeps each time it switches over. The rooms are poorly insulated from noise, I am not talking about the wildlife but the people in the room above.

Whilst the staff are lovely, everything else here is daylight robbery, everyone we spoke to complained, especially at the £13 for some spiced bar cashews. Food and drink are extremely overpriced and the  pool shots etc., they use in the promo materials are actually from a paid  separate club that isn’t included. A small, unheated pool is available but is very different from the promo materials.

The staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming. The rooms are spacious, Clean and comfortable. You can walk easily to Little Adam’s peak. 

Unfortunately all of the above is marred by the heavy building works. Restaurant, pool all closed for renovation. Which we knew about - but there was also more building work around the rooms. Which meant you could not easily relax on your balcony and enjoy the views because of the sound of building from 8am - 6pm. We were placed next to a new block build. 

The upgrade to Ravana pool club is not an upgrade in our eyes. Unless being by a pool with loud music and drunk backpackers is your thing. Not a great environment for people with children. 

This is the only hotel - which on check out did not ask us how our stay was or to give feedback. It’s because they don’t want to hear it. 

This will be an amazing place once all the building has been finished and pool is open again. It’s a beautiful spot.

Restaurant location and atmosphere

Cleaningness when going to the restaurant
Service vs value

The staff at reception is welcoming and the first contact is warm.
We discover our room and wow, very nice (freshly build). The view is breathtaking, clean, smells good, the bathroom is huge and the bedding is comfy and qualitative. All good so far.
You have a direct access to mini Adam’s peak and several activities like zipline, swing, etc.

We go to the restaurant for the diner and begins the disappointment. First, this bright and horrible automatic light oriented on the tables is really annoying, but seems normal to everyone. We could see in other guests’ eyes we weren’t the only one annoyed.
The staff is kind and smiley, do their best to please you but it is obvious that there were given either zero or a very light training. Give these guys a proper high standard hotel training please!
The breakfast is even worse as you discover that the restaurant is in the middle of the shop, the place were people from outside are meeting, you feel like in kind of a lobby. Really not pleasant. 
When you pay ~300usd the night, you expect something at the level of the price, and for this part, we are far, very far from it.
To conclude the “what to improve”, cleaningness. 
The hotel is ok, but you have to leave the hotel space to go to the restaurant and let’s be clear, it is full of rubbish (paper, plastic,…). Quite disappointing for a high-range hotel in Sri-Lanka and one of the best in Ella.

Overall, experience is pleasant, but leaves a bittersweet taste for the price you pay vs the service you get.","A mix between wonderful and disappointing experience","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r955938581-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at TripAdvisor . 

We value your feedback, and we'd like to address specific concerns you've raised:

Construction Noise:
We understand that the ongoing construction of additional rooms may have caused disturbance during your stay. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and want to assure you that the heavy maintenance is nearly complete. Moving forward, we are committed to minimizing any disruption to our guests and do the construction only during the day time from 09.30 am to  04.30 pm 

.

Room Conditions:
We are sorry to hear that your deluxe room did not meet your expectations in terms of cleanliness and design. Your comments are important to us, and we will take immediate action to address the issues raised, ensuring a more comfortable and enjoyable stay for our guests.

Ravana Pool Club 
We would like to clarify that the Ravana Pool Club is situated on the other end of the mountain and its music doesn't affect the resident guests . 

External Disturbances:  

To enhance our guests' experience, we are developing a private road to mitigate any disturbance from external visitors, tuk-tuks, and buses.

While we are pleased that you enjoyed the stunning setting, views, and our staff's service, we regret that certain aspects fell short of your expectations. .

Your feedback is invaluable as we work towards maintaining the high standards our guests deserve.

We hope you will consider giving us another chance to provide you with the exceptional experience that defines 98 Acres.

Things have changed since they were here. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and it became evident that the construction of a further 8 rooms was creating a lot of noise, and continued throughout Sunday too. We had booked a deluxe room and honestly it was far from deluxe. The bathroom was dirty and a lot of scum build up in the shower. The shower leaked and flooded the floor. The bathroom was very poorly laid out with the shower next to the window and only a dirty window sill to put shampoo and shower products on. The rooms were very poorly designed with no thought to finishing touches. I was expecting 5* and this was nowhere near that. 

The staff and food were excellent and it is undoubtedly a spectacular setting. The views from the restaurant and pool are stunning. However the rapid expansion and commercialisation of this area is so sad. The Ravana pool club pumped music out all day and late into the evening spoiling the peaceful tranquility of the place, as did the bus loads of visitors coming to visit the club and the zip line. The buses and tuk tuks were constantly up and down through the hotel as that’s the only access. Overall we were very disappointed with our stay. We had high expectations which 98 Acres didn’t live up to.","So disappointed.","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r928754413-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

On arrival we were taken to our room (Premium deluxe) and told it was a 4 minute walk to the restaurant! Maybe that was running! It was in the furthest block from the central hotel area with great views. The room itself was lovely with a large balcony and it was really nice to lie and listen to the wildlife.

It rained a lot whilst we were there and the path back up the hill became very muddy and wet. Calling for a tuk tuk was one thing but we felt very unsafe in them. The road is full of holes and really not in the condition you would expect from a resort of this calibre. In fact we often had to get out so the driver could get up the hill! Walking up in the rain meant we got to the restaurant feeling very wet. Not great.

The restaurant was lovely and the food on offer was very good. Service was sometimes a bit slow and the staff were not always as attentive as they could be. The breakfast spread was very good.

Our biggest problem was the noise in our room. To book into an expensive boutique hotel we did not expect to have to put up with noisy children who ran round and round the room next door shouting and screaming. They insisted on playing loud music and turning theTV up too. One morning we were woken with Christmas songs. Really not what we expected. The sound proofing in the newer rooms is non existent and when the people above us decided to move the furniture around it was very loud indeed. We did mention it to the staff and had the 'we could move you"" but the thought of moving all our belongings on a wet night in an dodgy tuk tuk did not appeal. There was no real concern from a manager and we were told the family were local. Not sure that should make a difference. In a hotel of this standard families should be put together and couples allowed to have the peace and quiet we paid for.

Sadly we didn't have the experience we had hoped for here.","Slightly disappointing but great views","2023-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r924933964-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Le cadre est magnifique, les chambres confortables et très propres, et le personnel globalement chaleureux et attentionné. La restauration était également de très bonne qualité, avec un large choix. L'hôtel dispose d'une grande piscine sur le toit de l'hôtel et offre une vue panoramique.
Cependant, nous tenons à signaler une mésaventure avec l’un des voituriers, un homme parlant français, qui nous a amené à l'un de ses amis pour acheter des souvenirs de vacances en nous promettant payer un bon prix car nous étions clients de l'hôtel.

Greetings from Kandy Myst by Cinnamon!

Thank you for your comprehensive review and for sharing both the positive interactions and the significant challenges you faced during your stay. We are particularly grateful for your recognition of Mr. Dhinal Perera's efforts in resolving your room issue and for noting the general politeness and helpfulness of our staff – we will certainly share your praise with the team.

However, we are truly sorry that these positive elements were overshadowed by serious shortcomings. We are sorry to hear about the initial error with your triple room booking, which should not have occurred. We also deeply regret the issues you experienced with the room's cooling system (temperature limitations), the lack of bathroom exhaust ventilation, and most notably, the state of the dinner buffet nearing closing time due to non-replenishment during a busy evening.

We understand why your experience led you to conclude that the hotel is currently better suited for short business stays than family vacations. As a hotel, identifying and rectifying such operational and potential infrastructural issues based on guest experiences is our highest priority.

We value this perspective immensely as we continue to refine our operations and facilities. Thank you again for your valuable insights. We are committed to addressing these points thoroughly.

Thank you!

Warm Regards,
Wathsala De Silva

Our package was a triple room but when we reached the hotel we found there is no triple room and we faced with a standard room with 28 SM that had no area for extra bed however as I mentioned by help of hotel GM we received extra bed . In second i do appreciate hotel staff who all were helpful and polite .in opposite of mentioned advantages i found serious problems which should be checked and removed otherwise the hotel can not meet 5 star hotel standards. actually the hotel is new built and still some construction activities signs can be seen different parts . It seems the hotel cooling system has major problem which returns to its design , the minimum temperature of our room  was only 26 centigrade in the day but nights it was better , I could not find exhaust fan in wash room which made me surprised  , i think exhaust fan is a must for ventilation that was missed , the windows was fixed and fresh air should be provided with HVAC system that as I mentioned above need redesign and doesn't work properly . The night that we entered the hotel I think it was full and it seems the hotel has not been mobilized for this condition , the first night that we went for dinner almost we found nothing to eat except some salad ,... there was 15 minutes remained to finish time of dinner but main foods did not charged and this made some problem which caused I meet Mr. Dhinal . as a conclusion I do believe Kandy Myst should totally re-checked for meeting 5 star hotels standards , its not recommended for families by no way and those who has planned for vacation , Kany Myst is okay for a business trip and for bedding i the nights , no more .

The receptionists took our passports and got our room mixed up with another guest which led to total confusion when checking out.
On the plus side, our room on the 14th floor had stunning views over the countryside, comfortable beds, good free wi-fi and powerful hot showers. 
The bar on the top floor also had excellent views and a DJ playing music till 23.00 - a great place to relax despite a very limited wine list (ie only 1 bottle of red wine available) though there was plenty of other drink options. The pool on the top floor was also very good.
We had the buffet dinner which had a large variety of dishes- however my wife had some chicken which hadn’t been cooked (the explanation from the restaurant staff that it was only 1piece was a bit ridiculous.) We did not eat there on our 2nd night! Having said that there was an extensive buffet breakfast with a chef making excellent omelettes to order.
The porters and cleaning staff were all very friendly and efficient.
Hopefully, this new hotel will get over its teething problems and become 1of the best hotels in Kandy - the potential is there but more care is needed.","New hotel on the outskirts of Kandy","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d32865997-r996509814-Kandy_Myst_By_Cinnamon-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Я предложила 10 usd, на что он сказал , что номер очень хороший (хотя мы такой и бронировали) и надо 20 usd. То есть с самого начало испортил нам отдых.  И так было везде.

Would compare the all inclusive experience to the ones I have experienced in Spain, its exceptable but not 5 stars.  You will never forget your room number as everytime you have a drink you need to give your room number and sign a receipt.
The big let down for us that there is no beach.  There are just boulders at the front if the hotel. This was very disappointing as all their advertisement showed a nice beach at the front. Another annoyance was at the fence facing the sea locals were stood pestering anyone who walked up to look out to the sea. At times i felt like i was in a zoo being looked at and it felt quite intrusive. Also the noise of the trains at the back could be disturbing as they ran through most of the night.

This hotel is advertised as a beach hotel, there isn’t one, where the beach was is now boulders, sandbags and rubbish. We brought this to the attention of the hotel as did many other people who were staying there.

Firstly the area, Kalutara for us is definitely not a tourist area. It is much more of a working town. Around the hotel there are very few bars, restaurants etc and since the problems even these are shut down so the hotel is the only place to have a holiday. If you want to just sit by a pool the hotel is fine for a visit but if you want to get out and about a bit also choose a different area. 

Hotels itself is a good standard hotel, a little dated but all clean and tidy. All the standard things you would expect in a hotel. No bath only a shower. 

Food on all inclusive was very good to be fair and we always found plenty too eat. Wine was restricted to 1 glass of wine with your meal and this was not best quality. 

Drinks were not the best and pretty restrictive on all inclusive. Only a few cocktails to choose from, spirits were all local and seemed pretty weak. 

Pools were big with plenty of beds around the grounds. Hotel is situated on the beach but do not expect the beach to be of a good standard, sand is golden with black sand in patches. There is a lot of debris on the beach so no chairs set on the beach. Waves were really but with some bad currents in the sea. Lots of hawkers about who were pretty persistent in trying to get some business. 

All staff were helpful and went out of their way to be helpful but English could be a bit of a problem with some. 

Hotel was empty when we visited only on average 30 people instead of the capacity of about 300. 

Weather was terrible when we visited so this may have tainted my time at the resort but I do hope that the tourists will return soon as there was only 30 in resort on average instead of a capacity of 300. The hotel and staff do deserve to have more visitors for the effort they put in.","Not a holiday resort","2022-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r865998279-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

This depends on the definition of 5 star.

The positive aspects.

Staff are unfailingly friendly, polite and helpful.

Rooms are adequate and comfortable  but not 5 star by any measure.

Public areas are pleasing but again, not 5 star.

Food is varied.

The negatives.

The public beach is coarse sand/fine gravel with a steep slope to the shore. The beach is untended and heavily polluted with plastics. The sea is very choppy and not suitable for very young or weak swimmers.

The pool bar is very basic.

We booked an all-inclusive package and were shocked to learn that wine with meals is restricted to a single glass per person. The wine quality is quite poor.

As paying adults, we can decide for ourselves if one glass is adequate. Beer doesn’t seem to be limited in quantity so why is wine different? We aren’t talking about high quality, bottled vintages! 

Is this 5 star service? Not in our experience.

Overall, if the hotel is viewed as 3 star with limitations,guests won’t be let down.

Mercury holidays advertise this hotel as 5 star but although the facilities here probably give it this rating the hotel itself is in my opinion not 5 star. The rooms and we looked at two were well past there best requiring some decoration and both an element of repair. The hotel is 23 years old and whilst it is imposing from the entrance and within the lobby the rest of the hotel seems to lack ongoing maintenance. The food was well presented but the Asian selection had too much chilli added and I am half Sri Lankan though I live in Europe. We joined a group already staying here and they all agreed about the food. The deserts and soup choices were good but I wouldn’t have liked to stay longer than a couple of days. It is good to have the train close by but it creates naturally a great deal of noise and some parts of the hotel vibrate as they pass. The staff are friendly but there is also a culture of tipping to keep the best sun beds which created problems. The staff should clearly not accept this as it is not a gratuity. I use the word tipping to be kind! All in all if you want lots of hotel facilities and not too bothered about food then you might find this hotel acceptable but to many of the guests I met we all agreed that by no stretch of the imagination is this a 5 star hotel.

Following is my review.

Reception - 5/10 - Reception was not so prompt, but somewhat okay. Baggages were handled properly. The welcome drink was a cordial instead of something fresh (did not expect this from a 5 star hotel, especially when it was a corporate booking for almost 30 people).

Room, bathroom, amenities & bedding - 8/10 - Spacious room, comfy bedding, clean washroom & needed amenities were there.

Pool - 6/10 - Very nice and humongous pool and it's spread across a vast area. The drawback is that the hotel management allows you to get in to the pool ONLY till 6:00pm..!!! This is totally UNACCEPTABLE as the guests are NOT staying in the hotel for FREE..!!! Guests should at least be allowed to have a swim till 8:00pm (as most other hotels do).

Food and dining - 7/10 - Food in the main restaurant was very tasty and there was a quite a lot of variety to be selected from. But the a-la-carte menu at the seafood restaurant was of no value for money. Many of us agreed that the food was not tasty.

Staff, service and friendliness - 6/10 - Some staff members were extremely helpful and friendly while some others were sort of minding their own business.

Overall rating - 6/10 - The expected level of a 5 star hotel is not met in my opinion. The management needs to pay more attention to the operation as a whole.","Nice hotel, but needs more attention..","2018-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r616431353-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at Hilton Colombo Residence. We truly appreciate your comments and apologize for the inconvenience you faced during your time with us.

We understand that the issues you experienced with the air conditioning in your room were extremely uncomfortable and frustrating. You were initially checked into Room but as per your request, we did a room move, which faced the Lotus Tower. At 7:20 AM, we received your report about the air conditioning not working, and our engineer, attended to the issue. However, we understand that you were still facing discomfort, and we sincerely apologize for the delay in resolving this matter.

When you sent a message via KIPSU, we were immediately made aware of the situation, and we regret that you did not feel comfortable reaching out earlier. I can assure you that we take these matters seriously, and upon your request, we promptly arranged for a room change.

We apologize for the lack of communication and the inconvenience this caused. It is certainly not the level of service we strive to provide, and we will be reviewing our processes to ensure that any issues with room conditions are addressed promptly and efficiently in the future.

On a positive note, we’re happy to hear that you had a good experience at our main restaurant. We value your feedback and will continue working to improve all aspects of your experience with us.

Once again, we apologize for the discomfort and disruption you faced during your stay. We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and provide you with the exceptional service and comfort you expect from Hilton.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your stay with us. We understand the importance of a smooth check-in process, and regret that we were unable to accommodate your early check-in request due to high occupancy, as early check-ins are subject to availability and our standard check-in time of 3 PM, which is mentioned in the confirmation.

We also apologize for the issues with the lifts, as we understand this can be frustrating, especially with events happening at the hotel. We are currently reviewing our procedures to better manage the flow of guests during peak times.

Regarding the air conditioning in the lobby and corridors, we are aware of the issue and are working on resolving it to ensure a more comfortable environment for all our guests.

We are also sorry to hear that the room setup did not meet your expectations. We appreciate your feedback regarding the television in the bedrooms and have informed the respective departments to check the suites and ensure everything is in proper working order.

Whilst I agree with the plethora of good reviews to some extent, one has to outline the negatives of this Hotel as well.

In terms of the room/suite rates they are certainly not cheap or reasonable for the level of accommodation you pay for.  The building as a whole remains the same as it was in it's inception in the 1990's. 

Having visited star class hotels globally, some in underdeveloped countries, this particular establishment is light years behind its competitors within the hospitality industry,  Not much internal work or improvement has been done as a whole to the property. If was to summarise the  internal features of this hotel it is like going back in time to the 1990's. The parquet flooring we remember when we were kids, the outdated elevator systems , the wooden furniture that we do not see if modern hotels etc.

The walls need some TLC to say the least as they probably haven't seen a paint brush for many years.  Please note our apartment had some damp/mold on the bedroom walls. The housekeeping department have issues with providing clean towels regularly, from what the cleaning staff have mentioned, I understand that the laundry is outsourced to an external service provider. The apartment was not cleaned until after 3 PM on most days and required some prompting. I believe this is due to staff shortages.

The service is slow the entire operation is run by trainees or apprentices all working 12-14 hour days with 4/5 shifts being worked consecutively . Most of them have mentioned how tired they are and the shortage /high turn over of staff within the hotel.

Everything about this hotel is dated and I am astounded how it has received so many good reviews. 

The only positive is the breakfast buffet I suppose and the friendliness' of the staff even though they don't have the necessary skills or the training to competently perform their duties.

General Manager and senior management team please take note of my comments above and hope you are proactive in your approach, in taking some remedial action to make the guest experience more fulfilling and cost effective.","Hilton Colombo Residences 3 Star Service and Facilities at 5 star Prices","2024-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r953156954-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your comments highlighted at your busy schedule. It is sad to read that you were not satisfied with your current stay. 

The service and levels of hospitality at Hilton Colombo Residences has mostly exceeded expectations and guests love the warm hospitality by my team members provided; however, I am sorry that you did not experience this during your stay. We do hope that you consider this to be an isolated incident which can be negated and do consider staying with us. I understand that my team met you on site and explained to you our heavy operations on that particular day that the restaurant was closed for a private function as well as your room service was delayed, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. With reference to the pots and pans we do provide our equipment upon request as we try to keep our utilities safe for mainly for hygiene purpose.

Once again thank you for your comments addressed to us and please do not hesitate to contact my team and myself whilst you are residing at Hilton Colombo Residences.

With kind regards

This is clearly set up this way to ensure you use the restaurant which does prepare great food.
Tonight we return back to the apartment, get a shower and head downstairs for a drink at the bar and intended to head for the restaurant.
When we arrived at the we were greater by very loud music which we quickly realised was comming from the adjacent restaurant which also appeared to be covered in balloons.
We stood up to go to the restaurant and the very nice bar manager told us that the restaurant was closed for a private function. Now I want to confirm at this point that we had no prior information confirming this closure.
We accepted the situation reluctantly and headed off back to our apartment to order room service.
At 20.39 the order was in, we sat then for close to 90 minutes for delivery !
Eventually I picked up the phone to ask where the food was, at this point I was told that due to demand forced upon room service because of the restaurant being closed for a private function they were struggling to meet the customer requirements however the gentle said ""your food will be with you in one minute"".
10 minutes later the food arrived, we order food for 4 people and we had 3 delivered and my daughters food wasn't there.
Moreover all if the food delivered was stone cold.
By now it was late and frankly it was becoming a little bit of a joke.
The waiter took the cash for the food and retreated cautiously, also kept the change, not that I mind that but I thought tips were based on service and performance !
Now this is an establishment with 30 floors and on average 10 apartments per floor, and the management clearly find it easy to negate the needs of the allready checked in customers in favour of a one off private party.
This really disappoints us, firstly the kitchen and lack of equipment to use the apartment in full and then this ridicules situation that we have found our selves in this evening.
One word sums the situation up ""DISCUSTING"".
We are here on a British Airways prepacked holiday, I will be taking the situation up with both the local Hilton management, international management and British Airways.

If you do visit remember your needs and wants while here on holiday are clearly not at the forefront of the establishments thoughts !

In fact, we had the higher expectation from the Hilton Residences over the other Hilton near the Dutch Hospital.  Our personal experience turned out to be otherwise.  I must concede here that we were not long-stay guests though, which is what Residences are supposedly designed for.  Originally we were due to stay here for 2 nights, but as the COVID-19 restrictions started to appear and our return flight got preponed, we ended up staying for a little more than 36 hours.

The booking was made via Honors points + money option for a standard 2 bedroom suite.  As an Honors Gold member, on contacting before travel we were pre-upgraded to a 3 bedroom premium suite on the 30th floor.  I had requested for 2 separate single beds for our twin boys, which seemed to be only available in their 3 bedroom configuration.  I was also told about a kids pool and a play area on the 3rd floor, although when checking in no such play area seemed to exist (more on that check-in later).  We were also sort-of confirmed of an early 9 AM check-in, as we were arriving Colombo from Kandy via an early morning train.  All of this till now sounds wonderful.

Our experience started to radically alter from the moment we arrived at the hotel entrance as in the following.
1.  There appeared to be a single attendant to shift our luggage during arrival.  We waited for a bit and this person was not to be seen.  Eventually, we got off the suitcases ourselves and let the cab go.
2. Although the lady who checked us in was pleasant (won’t take names) she was not very efficient and gave a bunch of wrong information.  First of all, she gave us incorrect breakfast timings. She also gave us the impression that we could have breakfast on the day of our check-in.  Now, this is not at all odd in this part of the world and is frequently extended to elites who check-in early.  So when we arrived for this breakfast at Flow, it was already over (as she gave us wrong timings) while on top of that our host wanted to charge all of us for the full breakfast (that was technically over!).  At the end, when we got up to leave, some staff (along with the check-in lady) sorted the issue out.  We found the staff at Flow to be not at all ready to handle regular long time Hilton guests.  On the second day when we requested to carry a few pastries to our room (for our kids) they made a huge fuss and sort of enlightened us on how they have a rule against it in their hotel.  Well, everyone has these rules, and still there is something that goes by the name guest service.  Here, the duty manager of that day had to step in.   The experience here was in such a contrast to the other Hilton in the city where F&B was clearly the highlight.
3. The hotel had, perhaps, the slowest set of elevators for a 30+ floor building anywhere in this planet.  On top of that only three of them are available any time, as the fourth one was a service elevator.  There was no air-conditioning at the common areas of the apartment floors.  I mean all this in a top rated hotel in Asia?
4.  Each time, it took us almost 7-8 minutes to “climb” up/down our apartment from/to ground level.  Now imagine after our check-in when we finally made it to our floor our check-in lady declared that she didn’t get the right key.  We easily waited for another 15 minutes to finally get inside our apartment.
5.  Our 3-bedroom apartment on the 30th floor was spacious and well-furnished for sure.  Our welcome amenities included a bottle of Chilean red wine (decent for a welcome wine), couple of dessert plates (apparently for our twin boys) which was a nice touch.  The balcony access was locked.  The bathroom and the living areas appeared somewhat renovated.  However, the apartment was quite old school and nowhere close to the upper-upscale standard.  There was no central air-conditioning (AC) and while the four split units were functional but they failed to be comfortable. The spacious kitchen, on the other hand, was beyond the reach of these ACs.  There was a washer-dryer unit inside a utility area that was out in the open.  The views from the windows all round our apartment was quite stunning though: the ocean was at a distance, while Colombo’s newest constructions were right in front and even a cricket stadium was visible.
6.  The room service was non-existent.  On the first day we asked for a turn down service in the evening that took forever, while on the second day no one serviced our room!  Yeah that’s right.

In summary, this Residences may work out for long-stay guests, especially with so many grocery shopping options around and who may not care much about their service standards.  But I wondered  why they have labelled it Hilton Residences (yeah, I know: due to the brand recall value in this part!), because in our experience even a Homewood Suites tag may be too much for their staff to handle.","A surprisingly average experience","2020-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r755349349-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review and rating on Hilton Colombo Residences. I regret to read that there were challenges concerning the requests made when booking and the requests not being honored. Smoking rooms are provided on availability and unfortunately this could not be extended. Therefore, as a gesture of willingness to find a solution, the balcony door was opened to be able to enjoy smoking outside. I apologize that this wasn’t up to your expectations though, and hope we can exceed your expectations on a next visit. 
We thank you for taking time to review your stay.

Thank you.

We also apologize for the interaction with the pool attendant and any confusion regarding the use of facilities at Jetwing Beach. We will address these concerns with the relevant team members to ensure that all staff are providing the level of courtesy and helpfulness our guests deserve.
Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve, and we will certainly work on enhancing the small touches and service consistency across the hotel. We hope you will give us another chance in the future to provide you with the experience you expect and deserve.

The food was absolutely fantastic, room service was prompt and pleasant, and the massage services were incredibly soothing. The pool and beach made for perfect relaxation spots, accentuated by a range of 5-star amenities. 

However, our check-in experience left a lot to be desired. Despite having made reservations in May 2024, and my father even came the week before to confirm the reservation, the reception staff struggled to find our booking even when we showed them our printed confirmation. The staff member left twice to check the reservation, eventually returning with the weak excuse that two confirmation numbers in their email had been misread.

Although our rooms met basic expectations, they were located far from the main lobby and dining area. Since we were a group of five and had booked two rooms, it would have been more appropriate and considerate for the hotel to allocate us to bigger rooms, preferably on one of the top floors as they have in the past. On top of that, room service staff even mentioned that we should have been placed in larger rooms.

Disappointingly, this was not the first time we faced this issue. We had a similar check-in experience during our stay at Jetwing Beach Hotel as well, where our time was wasted by the reception staff due to apparent disorganization and inadequate training of new employees. Given that they serve as the initial point of contact for guests, it's crucial that reception staff are well-trained by upper management.

While everything beyond the reception experience was delightful and up to our expectations, the initial check-in process needs significant improvement. Hopefully, our next check-in experience will be smoother, or we might have to consider staying elsewhere in the future. Nonetheless, Jetwing Blue remains a favorite, and we hope to see improvements for an even more enjoyable experience.","Good Stay But Improvements Needed at Check-In","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308530-r990235585-Jetwing_Blue-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We reserved a suite for our 3rd kid’s birthday celebration in February.  Jetwing blue will need some renovation in the room and I’m not sure why the commode was opening to verandah without any privacy. Jacuzzi was okay but had to call the maintenance team to fix some water issue. There was a blinder in the room and it fell off. They served us a cake and fruits were there when we checked in which we felt nice. Hotel was too busy with foreigners and may because of that they lacked the quality and Sri Lankan authentic hospitality. Their pool was fantastic though. Very spacious. Food was average cuz I was expecting something special. Spread was okay but could have had more proteins being a hotel in Negambo. Reception was little fussy about check out time but I think that’s because of the rush. Overall, I would rate my experience as average but Jetwing as a group hotel is definitely a well renown chain of hotels. Can be recommended based on that.","Average","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308530-r956205365-Jetwing_Blue-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We stayed in family room which was huge and comfortable enough. One concern we did have though was that the balcony railings were not sufficient to stop a toddler crawling underneath. When you are in a family room with young children the last thing you need to worry about is the safety of children on a balcony. 

Pool area is very beautiful and great size however when we was there a roof tile fell off and landed in the pool not far from where kids were playing. It left a lot of stunned looking people in shock. The pool guy just fished it out with a net like it was a fairly regular occurrence.

Negombo beach is a working beach and not the most pleasant place to enjoy. We did find it annoying that hawkers are allowed to constantly pester you when sitting by the pool and the staff make no effort to discourage this. I appreciate these people are only trying to earn a living but we live in SL and as westerners do get fed up with the attention in daily life  so when we stay at a hotel it’s nice to enjoy peace and quiet.

Food is very average in quality and there is almost no variety. This May unfortunately be more as a result of the situation in SL though.

To summarise it’s a nice hotel for sun worshippers and comfortable enough if the price is reasonable.

We didn't arrive until after dark, and it was hard to find off the main road.  For rooms, the lodge has erected elevated concrete block foundations and placed modified 20-foot shipping containers on top of them with stairs and a small deck for access. One side of the shipping container has been replaced with a partial glass wall/sliding doors, and the inside fitted out as a modest hotel room.  There was a double bed, two night tables, one luggage rack, another place for luggage in the ""cabinet"" with hangers, coffee/tea maker, two bottles of water, AC and a fan. There were two large towels, two wash cloths, and one bath mat in the small bathroom. There was no blow dryer.  Water in the shower was lukewarm, not hot, but at least not cold.   Wifi was available only in the dining/lounge area.  We arrived late at 7:45 pm after a long and unproductive ""safari"" in Wilpattu.  Dinner was underwhelming: some bread, fish curry, dhal, water, and ice cream with a small banana.  Breakfast was bad coffee, papaya juice, scrambled egg, some sort of sausage, barely toasted bread with butter and a grilled tomato.  Service was pleasant.  It provides the basics, but we would not likely  stay here again, nor would we go to Wilpattu.","2.5 to 3-star small rooms, accommodations in modified shipping containers.","2019-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12549273-d13356734-r655607379-The_Backwaters-Eluwankulam_North_Western_Province.html",

When we arrived in our ground floor room, there was a very strong sewage smell. Hotel maintenance tried rectifying but smell remained throughout the 1 night stay. Suspect the smell is typical for the ground floor rooms. Ask for a room on first floor to avoid this, 

We went out with a private driver at 05.30am to climb Lion rock. The property gate was however still closed and we had to climb the fence to get out. Apparently part of the gate was left slightly open, but only learned this when coming back. Nobody answered calls and knocks on the door where the person was still sleeping. Better communication the night before would have prevented this. 

Breakfast was good and besides the smell, the hotel is actually good as well.","Bad smell in the room - would not come back.","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r979425640-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

The only hiccup was hotel sigiriya were we got a grumpy waiter, numerous dishes on the menu  not available and to top it off the costs quoted on the food and beverage menu didn't include an extra 30% taxes ( they were in the fine print).
Watch out, this was the only place we stayed at that did this and it was somewhat sad that this experience was the only downside to such a memorable trip.

Whilst the food is good, the service in the restaurant is bad. If you don’t arrive soon after opening, you find that tables that have already been used have not been cleared and reset. It is rare that someone clears your empty plates away between courses, leaving them to stack up around you. It’s not nice to dine surrounded by tables covered in other people’s dirty plates. Empty dishes on the buffet are not refreshed so that your own choice is reduced. And trying to get someone to take a drinks order is hit and miss at best. 
Other staff in the hotel (poolside, reception, housekeeping) are friendly and helpful, but the restaurant waiting staff are not great. It would perhaps help if there was more of them. 
It’s a shame because the hotel itself is nice, with a lovely view of Lions Rock from the pool, and our rooms were a good size and clean. But although there are cafes within a few minutes walk which can be used for lunch, the dark road outside means that you will likely want to stay in the hotel for dinner in the evening and unfortunately that’s not a great experience.","Good hotel but with poor restaurant service","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r967173408-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

The restaurant is somewhat pricey and the tax added on makes the price similar to Australia. A tuna baguette with a few fries is 1800 LKR but with tax/VAT comes to over 2300 LKR. Tax seems to be added on for everything at this hotel. Some prices are in LKR (food, bar) some are in American dollars (spa). No information given at check in and there is no information in the room.

Thank you for choosing to stay at Kithala Resort and for taking the time to share your feedback. We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed our scenic location amidst the paddy fields and appreciated the peaceful surroundings and open-air swimming pool. We’re also pleased that you found our rooms clean and well maintained.
However, we’re truly sorry to hear that certain aspects of your stay did not meet expectations. We sincerely apologize for the mix up with the breakfast parcels, especially regarding the vegetarian request. This is not in line with our service standards, and we understand how disappointing and inconvenient this must have been for your group. 
We also regret to hear that the bathroom space felt cramped and that our dining options, particularly for children, were limited during your stay. Your comments have been noted, and we are currently reviewing our facilities and menus to better accommodate a wider range of guest preferences.
Regarding the insect presence, being located so close to natural surroundings does present challenges, but we are working on enhanced pest management solutions to ensure a more comfortable outdoor experience for our guests.
Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us and helps us identify areas for improvement. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with a more enjoyable and seamless experience

The property is surrounded by scenic paddy fields and has an inviting open-air swimming pool with views of lush greenery, which was quite relaxing.

However, the overall experience was underwhelming. While the room was clean and decently maintained, the bathroom was noticeably cramped and could use an upgrade.Food quality at the resort left much to be desired, with limited options overall and nothing catering specifically to children.

One of the biggest disappointments was the breakfast arrangement for the safari. We were provided with a packed meal for our 5 a.m. safari, but despite requesting separate vegetarian and separate non veg options , chicken steaks were included in the vegetarian parcel. This made the food unusable for our group and was quite frustrating.

Additionally, the insect presence around the property was excessive, which made spending time outdoors less enjoyable.

While the resort has potential thanks to its natural surroundings and proximity to Yala, it falls short in service quality and attention to detail. With some improvements in food service, hygiene, and guest needs, it could offer a much better experience.","Living our Tarzan moments at yala national park 🏞 ","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1576453-r1015351634-Kithala_Resort_Thema_Collection-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Dear Distinguished Guest,

I sincerely apologize for the challenges you faced during your recent stay with us. I understand that your first night was difficult, and I endeavored to find a satisfactory solution.

Upon your check-in, you expressed concerns about the room standards and requested two adjacent double king size bed rooms. Unfortunately, due to full occupancy, it took longer than anticipated to accommodate your request. While I arranged for this, I suggested you have dinner at our restaurant, but you preferred to wait in the lobby for a resolution. I appreciate your patience during this time.

We eventually provided two rooms next to each other, with only one room in between. I acknowledge the inconvenience you experienced while waiting for this arrangement. I regret the issue with the key breaking as you attempted to access your room, and I assure you that we addressed this technical problem promptly.

Regarding the breakfast order, I acknowledge that an error occurred on our part, and we sincerely apologize for this oversight. We did prepare customized food for you and offered complimentary lunch as a gesture of goodwill, which you chose to decline.

Please rest assured that we take guest feedback seriously and strive to rectify any dissatisfaction. The issue with the coffee maker was resolved during your stay, and we personally attended to you at check-out to express our apologies once again.

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future. Thank you for your understanding.

Thank you very much for your detailed narrative on the experience at Kithala Resort. We really appreciate you taking the time to put your experience to words which helps us assure a better service in future.
We have noted your comments and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused at the check-in. We gently remind you that we did not “assure” you of a possible check-in at 12.00 pm but instead promised that “we would try our level best to arrange the check-in before 2.00 pm.” The hotel being highly occupied on the previous evening the rooms were not ready for check-in at the time of your arrival . However, we were able to offer the double room at 12.30 pm and the triple room at 1.15 pm.
 
The rooms being available for booking online does not mean that the rooms are clean and ready for check-in at that moment itself. Our efforts to explain the situation to you was misunderstood as being rude. 
 
We would like to emphasize that for us at Theme Resorts, guests are our first priority, and we would not have kept you waiting if there was a possibility of giving the rooms earlier. 
 
We thank you for your understanding.
 
Regards,
The Management- Theme Resorts & Spas.

I used to stay at Mandara Rosen and wanted to try somehow different. When I was browsing on the internet for a place to stay in Tissa, I came across this hotel. Upon reviewing the comments, I noticed one comment about an early check-in not being given even when rooms were available. Therefore I called the hotel and inquired if I will be able to check in around 12noon if rooms are available. I was assured this was possible.

Therefore I pre-booked 01 triple and a double through the hotel website and made the full payment online. There is a place on the booking form where they inquire on the time of arrival to which I replied as 12.00noon.

Arrived at the hotel at 12.07pm. This was on a Thursday and the hotel was empty. No welcome drink was provided till 30 minutes later and that too upon inquiry. The front office Manager Madawa was very rude and simply said the check-in time was 2.00pm and for us to have lunch first. As we were after a five hour drive, we wanted to check-in and freshen up before lunch. Therefore I requested that we check-in first and as the hotel was empty, why was this not possible? Then I was told all the double rooms were booked and only family rooms and triples were available and this was the last double. Then I checked their web site and it showed 21 doubles were available (this was only on the room hunt offer so there would have been more outside). When I pointed this out to the Manager, he changed his story and said these are the only double and triple available next to each other. I was a bit puzzled as a triple is no different to a double apart from an extra bed in most hotels. The Manager was pushing us to have lunch instead with no courtesy whatsoever. Finally I said we will forego lunch and wait for the rooms to be ready. Finally the rooms were ready around 1.15pm. 

Upon entering, both the double and the triple was identical apart from the extra bed. Having 21 rooms available, why they could not allocate two rooms and allowed us to check-in around 12.30pm is a mystery

The food was a basic spread but tasty. The Chef Gayan and the restaurant Supervisor Segar on the other hand was a complete contrast to the front office manager. They were very friendly and helpful which made our stay somewhat pleasant.i gave three stars considering the service of the restaurant as if not, the rating would have been a lot lower.","Terrible front office","2019-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1576453-r734386861-Kithala_Resort_Thema_Collection-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is very small and located in a thin strip between the main road & a paddy field. Rooms a very untidy. Our AC was not working properly and the water was leaking to the room floor. The bathroom is smelly.
I think the theme resort management should seriously looking into the standard of this hotel.
The only postive experience was we had in the restuarant. Roshan & his team was super  & tendered an excellent service though the food variation is limited. Food was tasty.

Thank you for choosing Waterland and for taking the time to share your experiences and observations.

Guest reviews help other travelers make informed choices about where to stay.

You are indeed correct that most guests who stay at Waterland are at the beginning or end of your trip.  

Your review states that “it claims to be on an estuary”.  We reviewed our literature and marketing materials and found no mention of being on an estuary.  Please let us know if that description of being on an estuary was in some marketing material. We also did a Google search and similarly found nothing that suggested that Waterland is on an estuary.  If a travel agent suggested that Waterland is on an estuary, please let us know the name of the travel agency so that we can correct the travel agent and thereby prevent any other guests from being similarly disappointed about the location.

We can well understand your disappointment about the location if you were expecting to be on an estuary as Waterland is not on an estuary.  

Waterland is on the meeting point of a river and a canal and is 700 meters from the ocean. 

Thanks for noting that guests should take with the steps across the pool in the living room of the Monsoon Villa.  The Monsoon Villa is the only villa in which the outdoor plunge pool carries on into the interior spaces of the villa.  The steps across the pool to one of the bedrooms provide the living room with an added touch of romance.  The design was inspired by a villa we stayed at some years ago in Seminyak.  Your advice for guests to take care when crossing the steps is excellent.

We are sorry that there was such a delay in the lunch order, that the lunch order was incorrect, and that you were disappointed by the service.  Meals are cooked to order.  That said, waiting for an hour for lunch is long.  We can well understand your annoyance at having to wait so long, especially if the food provided differs from what you had ordered.

We hope that you had a wonderful trip to Sri Lanka and that you have fond memories of the island despite the several disappointments you experienced at Waterland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2024-01-02","OTHER","3","Triple-check and double-confirm that food order!","Value","3","Location","3","Service","3",,,,,,,"We stayed here because we were flying out the next morning (which I think is true for a lot of people).

Wir freuen uns, dass Ihnen die Villen, die Lage und das Design gefallen haben. Waterland wurde tatsächlich mit Liebe gebaut und wird mit Liebe betrieben.

Waterland hat enorme Anstrengungen unternommen, um talentierte und engagierte Mitarbeiter zu rekrutieren und zu halten. Unser Küchenpersonal, das Reinigungspersonal und das Managementpersonal sind alle seit vielen Jahren bei Waterland.

Leider haben einige unserer Mitarbeiter an der Rezeption kürzlich das Unternehmen verlassen, um im Ausland Karriere zu machen.

Selbst bei hohen Gehältern, guten Arbeitszeiten, großzügigen Sozialleistungen und guten Personalunterkünften war es unglaublich schwierig, erfahrenes Personal an der Rezeption zu finden. Dies ist nicht nur ein Problem für Waterland. Ein großer Teil der gut ausgebildeten Arbeitskräfte hat Sri Lanka aufgrund der Inflation und der Wirtschaftskrise, die das Land heimgesucht hat, verlassen.

Das Personal an der Rezeption, das wir einstellen, ist freundlich und vertrauenswürdig, verfügt aber nicht über Erfahrung. Infolgedessen gibt es Probleme wie die, die Sie bemerkt haben

Wir entschuldigen uns zutiefst für die durch diese Unerfahrenheit verursachten Unannehmlichkeiten.

Wir haben ein strenges Schulungsprogramm, aber natürlich braucht es Zeit, um zu lernen und die erforderlichen Kenntnisse, Fähigkeiten, Gewohnheiten und das Selbstvertrauen zu entwickeln.

Aufgrund Ihrer aufschlussreichen Bewertung habe ich den Manager, den stellvertretenden Manager und den Rezeptionsmanager gebeten, einzugreifen, um die neuen Rezeptionsmitarbeiter genauer zu beaufsichtigen und sie bei ihrer Schulung besser zu unterstützen.

Bezüglich WLAN verfügt jede Villa über einen eigenen WLAN-Router. Es gibt zwei weitere Internetverbindungen für das Personal, sodass WLAN-Verbindungen in den Villen nicht durch das Personal verursacht werden, das das WLAN nutzt. Leider ist die Internetverbindung in Sri Lanka aufgrund einer unterentwickelten Infrastruktur oft langsam und unzuverlässig.

Wir entschuldigen uns noch einmal für die Mängel, die Sie während Ihres Aufenthalts festgestellt haben. Es liegt uns sehr am Herzen, sicherzustellen, dass unsere Gäste im Waterland ein magisches Erlebnis haben. Ich hoffe, dass das neue Personal an der Rezeption schnell lernen wird und bald in der Lage sein wird, den hohen Servicestandard zu bieten, den Gäste erwarten und verdienen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2023-11-29","MOBILE","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Die Unterkunft und einzelne Häuschen sind sehr schön und mit liebe eingerichtet.

Doch für den Preis hätte ich mir dann doch etwas mehr erwartet. Das beginnt damit, dass bei den Mahlzeiten zwar immer Wasser eingeschränkt wird, doch nicht mal nach weiteren Getränkenwünschen gefragt wird. Auch das Essen muss immer vorab ausgewählt werden (woran ich schließlich die Keller immer erinnert habe, damit sie nicht dann plötzlich kurzfristig vor der Tür stehen). Ich hatte Vollpension... doch es wurde nicht erklärt, was/wie ich alles wählen kann und so hatte ich zunächst immer nur eine Hauptspeise. Auch bei Frühstück bekam ich dann nur meinen gewünschten Morgenbrei und Kaffee - fertig. Generell war das Essens-Angebot für Vollpension relativ überschaubar. 

Tagsüber war das WLAN in meinem Zimmer sehr schlecht (gaanz früh morgens ist es gerannt) - ich vermute, dass das Personal auch im Internet war?!

We're sorry that your experience was not more uniformly positive. We know that a few disappointing aspects of a stay - limited restaurant hours, a menu that does not meet what you had hoped for, inadequate communication, ... can tarnish an experience.

We very much appreciate guest feedback, perhaps most especially feedback on how we can improve.  To avoid similar disappointments in future, we have now expanded our dining room hours so that we are open on Tuesdays.  We have also eliminate the breakfast basket that you described as makeshift.

From April - July, we have been closed in order to revamp the kitchen and carry out a wide variety of upgrades to the property.  In terms of the dining experience, we now have a talented and energetic new head chef, doubled the size of the kitchen, and added on to the dining room so that we can accommodate all our guests at the same time.  We also did a full upgrade of the outdoor dining experience, building a magnificent new outdoor kitchen and doing a number of upgrades to the dining barge including new seating and a a new thatch roof.

Other upgrades made in the past 4 months are 2 new pools, new pool tiles for all the existing pools, larger gardens for the Studio Villas on the Canal, new landscaping,  2 new bathrooms, a new lounge, and a new games room.

Again, we're sorry that you had a disappointing stay.  If you do return to Sri Lanka, please let us know.  We would love to host you and provide you a more consistently stellar guest experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2019-03-13","MOBILE","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Disappointing.

We're glad to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and friendly and that you found the  villa to be nice and clean.

We're sorry to hear that you were not fully satisfied with some other aspects of your stay.

It seems that once you learned that there was a charge for the airport pickup, you were no longer able to enjoy your stay.  We have all been in situations in which an initial disappointment colors the whole experience.  

Waterland offered free airport pickup until 31 December 31, 2016 to guests who booked from December 1, 2015 - 30 September 2016.  We did this to ensure that guests had no difficulty finding Waterland.  Your stay began on 25 January, 2017.

Waterland has a strong commitment to responsible tourism and environmental sustainability.  We sponsor clean-up campaigns in the neighborhood, have installed solar panels for the hot water supply, and have installed energy efficient air-conditioners, energy efficient lights, and energy-efficient appliances to minimize our carbon footprint.  As part of this commitment, each of the villas has a ""key card"".  When the guest comes in and inserts the key card, all the lights, air-conditioners, fans, ... can be operated.  When the guest leaves the villa, she/he removes the key card, ensuring that there is no wastage of energy in the guest's absence.  It seems that we did not do a good enough job explaining the environmental function of the key card system.

It seems that you then had some disappointment about the display of prices in dollars.   We display prices in dollars for several reasons.   First, nearly all our guests are from abroad and have a good working knowledge of the value of the U.S. dollar.  Second, most of our guests come to Waterland at the start or end of their stay and have dollars, but not rupees at that point in their journeys.  Third, we were following a tradition of other boutique properties in Sri Lanka, India, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos to display prices in U.S. dollars.  There is no expectation that guests pay in dollars and guests are welcome to pay their bills in Sri Lankan rupees.  Our acceptance of Sri Lankan rupees is evidenced by the fact that you settled your bill in Sri Lankan rupees.  We use the currency exchange rates of the xe dot com currency converter calculator.  These rates offer ours guest more rupees to the dollar than they would receive at a bank in Sri Lanka.

As with many things, it seems that much of your dissatisfaction may have stemmed from misunderstandings.  I'm sorry for any shortcomings in our communication about exchange rates, why we price in dollars, why you did not receive a free airport pickup, and why you were not able to keep the AC running through the day while you were away from the villa.

Just as are committed to responsible tourism, we are also deeply committed to the guest experience.  Accordingly, on your next visit to Sri Lanka, we would be delighted to welcome you back for a night's stay free of charge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2017-01-28","OTHER","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I must start by saying that the staff who work  in the hotel are helpful and friendly, but that cannot be said for the way the hotel is managed.I booked my stay through Agoda and my paperwork stated clearly that I had a one way airport transfer and breakfast included. However, the manager/assistant manager refused to provide that despite three phone calls from the staff who had seen the evidence! The room was nice and kept clean, but be aware that the hotel likes the A/C to be turned off when you are not there and the room becomes very hot and it is slow to cool down on your return. The food breakfast was ok ish, but there was a somewhat limited selection and not too much of it. The other menu was not very comprehensive and was small in quantity. It is highly overpriced for what it is and BEWARE, the menu is priced in US dollars , for some ludicrous reason, but when u pay for it, you are expected to pay in Sri Lanka rupees, which means you are subjected to a very poor exchange rate, giving you even less good value for money. Why on earth can they not just be up front and price the meals in the currency of the country, which you are in like every one else does? I had really hoped that this hotel was going to be a real paradise like oasis, but I was left feeling much disappointed. Sadly I would never visit the hotel again. I am not a fan of being ripped off.

We are delighted that you had a good stay on your first night, that you found the Deluxe Villa to be great, that you found the views outstanding, and that you enjoyed the infinity-edge plunge pool.  It's good to hear that it was the perfect start to your holiday and that the stay deserved a 5 star rating.

Your concerns about the price of dinner suggests that we need to do a better job in our marketing.  We need to be clearer that Waterland is a premium property and that budget travelers will be happier elsewhere.  Our 4-course gourmet dinner with an amuse bouche costs for 15 USD provides excellent value, but obviously is not a good fit for those who want to spend just a few dollars on a meal.

Thanks too for sharing your concern that we were not able to serve breakfast before your early morning departure.

One night when we arrived in Sri Lanka and one night before we left. We have mixed feelings about Waterland. Our first stay was excellent: beautiful family villa with a outstanding view, 2 very modern and beautiful bedrooms and a sitting room. We were delighted to swim in the private swimming pool with views on the beautiful river. We had dinner on the site which was ok. A little bit expensive for what you got for 20 dollar per person. Breakfast was very good and started at 8.30 am. Late for a tropical country but that didn't bother us because we weren't in a hurry. Perfect start of our holiday and this stay deserves a 5 star rating.
Nevertheless, our return stay was different. We stayed again in the family villa which was great. However the sheets in the upper bedroom were very stained. We decided to go to Negombo for dinner because of our average dinner experience in Waterland before. To go to Negombo beach is an quick tuk tuk ride 800 LKR return fee. Next morning we had to leave the hotel at 7.15 am in order to catch our flight back home. So in the afternoon before, we asked the personnel if we could get breakfast earlier than 8.30am or  could have a picknick breakfast. They had to ask Mr. Mark, the boss living abroad. In all hotels in Sri Lanka and other countries it never was a problem, so we didn't think it would be problem at all. But after we came back from dinner we were very surprised and disappointed to hear that is wasn't possible. A 5 star accommodation turned out to have a 1 star service level in our opinion. We already payed for the breakfast and we couldn't get a refund, having breakfast at 7 am is everywhere in the world a normal time to eat. And we couldn't even get a bottle of water or a banana to take to the airport before starting our 24 hour trip. We couldn't believe it! We went to the airport very disappointed.....And at the airport we spent 50 US dollars for breakfast. Just coffee and a sandwich for the 4 of us...","Beautiful rooms but don't stay there if you need to catch a morning flight.","2016-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r411843052-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We're glad that you enjoyed the cleanliness, the villa, the pool, the tranquility, and the beauty of the sunsets.  Waterland seems magical in the early mornings as the sun is rising and during the sunsets. We're delighted too that you found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. 

Thanks for expressing your concern about tips and about paying 6 dollars per person including tax for lunch.
 
Your comments underscore that we need to do a better job of conveying what Waterland is and is not so that guests will not be disappointed.   Waterland is not a local guest house where one can have a meal for a few dollars.  Nor is it a guest house in which there are 1 or 2 untrained workers.  Waterland is a premium private estate with lavish accommodations, a large staff (6 full-time staff for 10 guests), and a highly experienced, attentive, and educated staff with good English skills.  To provide guests gain a better understanding of what Waterland is and is not, I will upload the menu to the website.  I will also add some information to the frequently asked questions section of the website so that guests have a better understanding of the property, the restaurant, the prices, ...

Your points about the dining experience were also very helpful.  It seems that you were served an a la carte meal by the cook and not by the chef.  I worked with the chef this past weekend and emphasized the importance of consistently high quality meals and short wait times.  I reiterated the importance of preparing only items on the menu which we know we can do well and which we know that we can prepare in a timely manner.  

We are now serving a more streamlined, dynamic, and high quality breakfast menu, a 2-course fixed price lunch, and a 4-course fixed price dinner menu.  I have developed these items with the chef, had each menu offering this weekend, and can vouch for their excellence.

If you do return to Waterland, I think you will be delighted by the dining experience.  That said, the meal prices parallel our costs and are on par with those of other luxury properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2016-04-22","OTHER","3",,"Location","4","Service","5","Sleep Quality","4",,,,,,,"We stayed here for one night before we flew out. We had a lovely room on the river and were pleased with the cleanliness and the pool. It was fantastic watching the sun set and the location was quiet. The hotel was able to arrange a tuk tuk so we could have a look around because the hotel is a little out of town and away from restaurants. I don't know if it was because the hotel was relatively new, but there seemed to be a teething issues. First of all, the staff were very friendly and helpful but I couldn't help think that they were waiting for a tip every time something was delivered to the room. It doesn't help that there were constant reminders in the guide book to tip as well. My second complaint were the meals. We had lunch when we arrived and were charged 24 US dollars for 4 average bowls of pasta. This is quite expensive for Sri Lankan standards. In retrospect, we would have eaten somewhere else (there are some fantastic restaurants overlooking the beach that offer great seafood). My last gripe was breakfast; it took forever. Luckily we were able to enjoy the pool! The hotel was able to give us a late check out which was greatly appreciated.

Upon arrival, the hotel made a good first impression – the building looks nice, the welcome was pleasant, and the reception staff were kind and helpful.

We were accommodated on the first floor of the older part of the building. The room was clean, but signs of aging and wear were noticeable on the furnishings. However, the overall atmosphere was quite pleasant.

Restaurant and Services

Unfortunately, dinner at the hotel restaurant was disappointing. First, we had to wait several minutes for a table. When we finally got one, it was dirty, with only minimal tableware set. The staff ignored us for a long time, and when we tried to order drinks, it took more than 15 minutes before someone came to us. Despite repeatedly asking, we kept being told that a waiter would be called, but no one came for a long time.

The buffet selection was quite large, but the food quality was average. The same situation occurred during breakfast – a lack of pastries, slow service, and mediocre food quality.

Outdoor Areas and Pool

The outdoor infinity pool is one of the hotel’s main attractions. It offers beautiful views and is located in the new part of the building. Unfortunately, even here, the service was lacking – when we wanted to order from a selection of more than 15 types of Arrack in the evening, we were told that none were available.

Overall Rating

The hotel has great potential, with a beautiful historic building and a pleasant environment, but the quality of service does not match a five-star rating.

Our room was clean and very spacious and had a lovely balcony, however, there were no seats on the balcony. The pool was beautiful and we liked the tanning chairs that were located in the pool. The poolside bar was also great. We did not enjoy the food. We found ourselves unable to enjoy anything at the dinner buffet and had to find a restaurant nearby instead. We decided to try our included breakfast buffet the following morning and also could not enjoy anything that was offered. The hotel itself is wonderful, but the food was not good at all. I recommend planning to eat outside of the hotel.","Great Hotel, Terrible Food","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r981984064-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Upon arrival the checking in process was average and towards the end I had to go and confirm the  process had been completed. It felt we were left stranded. Not even shown where the lifts were located.
You are only issued with one key card and a third time used key card holder. Masking fluid had been used to remove the previous room number! ( this was a cardboard key card holder). You had to return both at the end of your stay otherwise according to the guest information book in the room there would be a 20 USD charge for lost cards.  I find it unbelievable you are issued with a used key card holder and incur a possible charge.
The food was very good, however, if you would like a bottle of wine with dinner, only the most expensive wines were available throughout our stay which reduced the wine menu  significantly . No apology was given from anyone when attempting to order  the wine. 
There is a small swimming pool with only eight sun beds available. However, it seemed to work. 
We had a driver from the hotel who took us around Kandy for the day and very informative regarding the sights and made sure we were dropped as close as possible and agreed a pickup time. A big shout out for excellent service.

The staff were notably friendly and accommodating, making our stay pleasant. The restaurant and buffet provided delicious meal options, though the à la carte portions were disappointingly small.

The beds were comfortable, ensuring a good night’s sleep. However, the rooms appeared to be a bit dated and could benefit from some refurbishing. The gym, despite having a cool setup, had leakage issues that need addressing.

Room soundproofing was another concern, as we could hear noises from adjoining rooms. Additionally, the internet connection was often slow and unreliable, which could be inconvenient for guests needing consistent online access.

A peculiar aspect of the hotel was its pricing policy, especially the obligation to participate in certain events, which felt a bit imposing. This policy could be a turnoff for guests seeking more flexibility during their stay.

In summary, while The Golden Crown has its charms and commendable aspects, there are several areas that require attention to truly justify its status and pricing.","Mixed Experience at The Golden Crown, Kandy","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r932085014-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Our new infinity pool is in the process of being constructed, and next year we will open it for our esteemed guests.
Regarding the matter of soundproofing, we will be installing a soundproofing system in our rooms, and our new premium rooms are being built in the new wing, which will be open to our guests next year.

We assure you that you will give us a chance to redeem ourselves.
We wish you all the very best, we are looking forward to welcoming you back at The Golden Crown Hotel Kandy.

• All expected amenities were provided.
• The staff was friendly and made an effort to accommodate us.
• The lake view was lovely and peaceful—though the garden area could benefit from a bit more space to fully enjoy it.
• Most of the food items on the dinner menu (Room service) were tasty, and the portions were generous.
• The pool area was clean, appeared well-maintained, and was nicely arranged.
• Breakfast was acceptable in terms of taste, though nothing exceptional.

Negatives:
• Overall, the hotel was poorly maintained and did not reflect a 4-star standard—more in line with a 3-star experience.
• The room cleanliness was lacking. In particular, a sliding window in our triple room was not properly fitted, leading to water leakage during rain. This caused discomfort, as water dripped onto the third bed placed near the window.
• The bathroom setup in the triple room was inconvenient, with only a shower available and no tap for a quick body wash. The single room bathroom did not have this issue, but both rooms showed signs of poor maintenance and cleanliness.
• Room space was tight but manageable.
• Although dinner ordered to the room was generally good, the Seer devilled fish was not Seer fish as listed—it was Thalapath, and the taste was not good and fresh.
• Bathroom doors were old and difficult to close; they clearly need replacement.
• The bathroom floors did not drain well, leading to standing water, and the tiles were extremely slippery—posing a safety risk.
• Despite being located in a coastal area (Hambantota), the breakfast menu (Buffet) offered no seafood-based curries, which was disappointing.
• The single room’s bathroom commode was stained and not properly cleaned.

To Management:
While the staff appears to be trying their best to offer a pleasant experience, there are clearly gaps in maintenance, cleanliness, and attention to detail that fall under management’s responsibility. A 4-star rating sets certain expectations, and unfortunately, the experience delivered was closer to a 3-star standard. With improvements in upkeep, quality control, and better alignment between listed and delivered amenities, this property has the potential to offer a much better guest experience.","Nice Location, Average Experience – Needs Better Upkeep","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d2229377-r1004521025-EKHO_Safari_Tissa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Gorgeous views looking across Lake Tissa, watching the sunset was magical. The pool was a comfortable temperature and it was exciting to see a large monitor wandering across the grass.

The staff were very friendly and accomodating, helping carry bags up the stairs and looking after us very well in the restaurant.

What lets this hotel down is maintenance. It appears that some upkeep is currently being done, but it is quite shabby. Once you walk away from the lovely reception area you can see how tired the hotel is - peeling paint, cracked tiles, stained sunlounge cushions. Random storage areas were visible and also looked worn. 

The main part of the room was fine, though there are no PowerPoints beside the bed. The bathroom needs some work - shower head was calcified and needs with a good clean or replacement. There was damage to walls where things possibly had been removed. The cupboard just looks old.

There were flys in the buffet food area, and sometimes in the food. One of the air con units in the restaurant was dripping water onto the floor. But the staff in the restaurant were wonderful - explaining dishes and making sure we had enough.

I can see this once would have been a beautiful well maintained 4 star resort but it felt more like a 3 star. Hopefully with continued renovation it can return to what it once was.","Great staff, great location, hotel a little tired.","2024-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d2229377-r979296173-EKHO_Safari_Tissa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to provide such a detailed review of your recent stay with us.

 We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed the spaciousness of your room, the cleanliness, and the tranquil views of Tissa Lake. It is also encouraging to know that your initial welcome was positive, and that the safari arrangements met your expectations in terms of service.

However, we sincerely regret that certain aspects of your experience fell short of your expectations. Your feedback regarding the quality of the food, service at our restaurant, and the ambiance has been noted and will be shared with our management team to ensure improvements are made. We strive to offer our guests a high standard of service in all areas, and your comments will help us in our ongoing efforts to enhance our offerings.

We understand your disappointment with the safari experience at Yala and will consider how we can better inform and manage expectations for future guests regarding the nature of the wildlife experience.

We deeply value your feedback, and should you consider returning, we would love the opportunity to provide you with an improved dining and overall experience.

Thank you once again for your valuable input.

Our rooms were spacious, clean, with dated furniture, had nice views of Tissa Lake, was very quiet at night and in all three rooms the air conditioning was fine.  We had booked a safari through them and the car and driver were okay, but Yala (about a 40 minute drive to get to Yala and then being among the 250 vehicles racing up and down mainly the ""main road"" searching for limited game views) was such a disappointment when we were there that we did not do any further safaris.  We started with a light lunch in the restaurant, the fried rice was very bland, service almost non-existent, a slight odor in the restaurant; no wonder there was only one other table with guests - it looked like a tour group basic restaurant.  As we had other plans one morning, we only ate breakfast on our last day; there was enough choice, but the quality of the food was mediocre.  We had cocktails late one afternoon, and it took more than 5 minutes to find a waiter to order the drinks.  Our rooms were okay, but if I were to return I would eat elsewhere.","An okay place to stay","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d2229377-r967140248-EKHO_Safari_Tissa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Overall stay was not satisfying
Welcome was poor,no welcome drink provided
WiFi password was not given on arrival and kids had to request for it
Lunch was very bad and found 2 human hairs, one in the soup and one in a curry
Taste was OK but refilling took a long time
Table service was good and staff was friendly but didn't have serviettes and the supply of paper serviettes was inadequate with 5 kids
Dinner was OK, but rice was half cooked
Soup was horrible
Breakfast was quite good compared to other 2 meals which had a mix of western and Eastern cuisine
Room service was zero
Though we booked triple rooms, the coffee supplies were for a double room and when we requested for a extra supply of COFFEE NEXT DAY MORNING, to the room they said THEY ONLY SUPPLY THEM. ONCE TO A ROOM
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AS IT IS A BASIC FEATURE PROVIDED IN ANY HOTEL AND WE FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AS WE HAD TO STAY UNTIL BREAKFAST BUFFET TO HAVE OUR MORNING TEA
The amount of shampoo and body wash provided also was not adequate for the whole stay, for a family of 4 who booked a triple room
POOL WAS VERY POORLY MAINTAINED
One kid in our group had his toes cut to a sharp edged tile in the pool and we noticed that the same happened to another kid
Anyhow the view from. the poolside was mesmerising and relaxing
Departure also was not very good
There was nobody to open the EXIT GATE which was under lock and key and nobody even bothered to come and open the gate until we stayed there for about 5 minutes and not bothered to say sorry for the delay caused","STAY WAS NOT WORTH FOR THE MONEY FOR A FAMILY","2020-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d2229377-r762628648-EKHO_Safari_Tissa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Also, special thanks to the chef for amazing meals throughout our visit. Kids were really happy with what he prepared and his western and srilankan cuisine were both exquisite. 

The property itself is lovely and gorgeous big rooms. But there was so many issues:

1. google maps pin was incorrect and took us 30mins away from borderlands where we had just had an exhausting day of rafting. 
2. The room phone only worked on speaker mode. 
3. The fan regulator either worked on 1 or 5 speed
4. The hem of the blinds were broken and had to painstakingly pulled apart each time we tried to use the jacuzzi 
5. The tea hadn’t been replaced in a while and were stale when we tried to fix ourselves a cup of tea
6. The ice they brought for our drinks were tapered from the edges of the fridge as opposed to cubes of ice. 
7. Whilst we were ok with the charges for bottled water, I felt that it should have been mentioned as none of us cared for bottled water and were charged for it.

The room itself is beautifull, great view to the jungle through the huge glass window. Superb bathroom. 
We were on half board for two nights. First night menu: 
        Cream of vegetable soup
        Bread and Butter
        Fried Rice with chicken or sea food OR Pasta Bolognese
        Peach Melba
The second night choice was similar, soup, then a rice dish or pasta. 
Dining is an important moment on holiday, especially if you are in luxurious surroundings. The menu was closer to a school canteen!
The Nelum suite unfortunately has another suite attached to it. The architect thought it a good idea to have a connecting door between the two. The connecting door doesn't fit very well, so that both sound and light come through it. Our neighbours had a very small baby that cried in the night and had to be fed. So we had both the sound of the crying baby (close to the connecting door, since the door is at the fridge and sink area where food is prepared) and the light shining through the door onto our ceiling. It is a pity to come such a long way and then be disturbed by one's neighbours.
Although there is a swimming pool, this is at the central area, a long way from the rooms.  There are no designated changing rooms; staff suggested I change in the lavatory. I preferred not to swim!
Some people have written that the staff are not good here.  I disagree entirely as I found all the staff to be friendly and efficient, particularly the young man on front desk. The Manager was also most helpful and professional.

The room we got was very good, just like the online pictures , with tall windows with views of the jungle and waterfall. The bathroom in the room was great with great shower area and an excellent private jacuzzi which we really used. 
We reached the hotel around 4 pm the first day, so the only thing we could do was trek up to the caves with Lakman (who btw is a very good and friendly guide!). We reached the hotel back around 6.30 PM . The thing I  didn't like was that after sunset there is absolutely nothing to do in the resort . You are pretty much confined to your room, u can order room service , enjoy the jacuzzi and watch movies . They should really provide additional activities in the resort such as a games room, a spa , etc . 
The next day we went rafting and canyoning in the morning which was good fun. The rapids are easy and basic but still fun. We came back around lunch time . Unluckily that time Lakman was out of the hotel for some work and they don't have any other professional who can take u upto the waterfall. Once lakman came back he took us up to the waterfall where there is a natural swimming pool . That activity was quite good and fun. 
The hotel lobby and swimming pool is a bit run down , and the food is average. 
The receptionist Suren was pretty clueless all the time , he couldn't help us much in guiding us as to what all there is to do in Kitugala. 
The resort can do well in terms of adding facilities like a hammock where u can just lie down and enjoy the scenery , a games room, probably a spa , and some way of utilising the waterfall which is literally right there !! Like probably figure a way of doing a picnic lunch by the falls .

The many complaints written about the road are not  valid as long as you have a 4WD ,driving on this road is not a problem.The resort is bordering a waterfall and is the perfect place for rest and relaxation. The chalets have been beautifully designed to blend in with the environment and are extremely spacious and comfortable.
When we made the reservation we specified the need for vegetarian food and we were told (By the lady handling our reservation) that all we had to do was inform the chef and that he would make whatever food we wanted.
When we checked in we were disappointed to find that there was a very limited choice for vegetarians and dessert was limited to 2 items (Ice cream and curd and treacle ) and whatever we requested was not available (Mainly for Dinner - eg- : Lasagna sheets not available, Paneer not available )
However whatever limited food they did offer was absolutely delicious.They had an extensive menu for non vegetarians which our kids were happy with , so the problem of limited choice is mainly for the vegetarians. Unfortunately items on the the dessert menu were also not available !!
They have skelton staff who have to multi task (The pool boy who takes you on excursions and also handles maintenance , one waiter struggled to handle all 6 tables s the person at the reception had to chip in) and therefore unable to really focus on making the customers happy, which is part of the boutique hotel experience .
Since the price being charged is on par with boutique hotels you cannot except a customer to be satisfied with what is being offered, Palmstone retreat has a long way to go towards understand just this simple concept !  
We found it quite annoying that out of the two Jacuzzi's adjacent to the pool , one was not working & only one side of the other one was working, to add to this housekeeping didn't appear to have sufficient bath towels  so we had to be satisfied with face towels for 2 nights of the 3 .
One staff member worthy of mention was Lakmal , He is the boy in charge of the pool and he took us on 2 excursions (Beli Lena cave and a waterfall) both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. He appeared to be very knowledgeable, very cautious and very helpful when the kids were struggling on the hikes. 
Palmstone retreat should looks into the possibility of obtaining life jackets for adults and kids so that the guests who cannot swim very well can enjoy the natural pools near the waterfall safely as the water in some places is 30-40 ft deep. It is an amazing experience and one that should not be missed ! 
The ONLY reason why we decided to stay back instead of checking out earlier is because we enjoyed the environment so much. Thanks to Lakmal for making our stay a memorable one !","Beautiful retreat sans a boutique hotel experience !","2016-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r444007000-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The journey from the main road to the hotel is rather treacherous although we managed fine with our careful driver (ours was a Hiace van).
On arrival, the four loungers at the pool were occupied. I asked for one to be brought out only to be informed the hotel only had four sun loungers and this usually was not a problem as most guests stayed at their villas.  Disappointingly I had to just wait until evening for pool time as there is no possible way of lying on the grass. I dont think it is acceptable for a luxury hotel not to have facilities for at least half its guests to be pool side if you provide a pool as one of your main facilities.
The villas themselves are wonderful and look out onto expansive views of jungle and river.  The bathrooms were a particular highlight with jacuzzi baths and monsoon showers.
There is no alcohol on site so be prepared or decide to be healthy as we did.
Food is rather poor and a weak attempt at European fare - I would recommend this hotel just stick to cooking local food.
Service was hit and miss.
All in all, a wonderful location and a great base for hiking, swimming and rafting, all of which we did but still a way to go.","Satisfactory but with potential","2016-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r367258666-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

This is what they really should already be offering to their guests- I don't know why they don't.

It was a lovely hotel but the stressful 45 mins in and out rather ruined the experience.

In the middle of the forest, detached from any and all distractions. Premises border on the river, and is conveniently accessible from the hotel. Chalets are well spaced out, spacious, glassed up, and gives the immersive feeling of being surrounded by the wilderness.

The road leading up is very poor. We took a chance with a car on the advise of the hotel staff, but it turned out to be ok. You just have to go a bit slow. 

The food, leaves a lot to be desired. We weren't that satisfied with the choices in the menu, hence we requested a special order, which turned out ok. Value for money is very slim, since the prices are on the exuberant side of things. That is partly acceptable because the location is pretty remote here.

The staff was good. Checked in on everything and gave a few good recommendations on things to do.

No alcohol served in the premises - which is a let down because you have to travel to the nearest town to get some, and even so, having a risk of not finding anything of quality because the area is not that well populated.

The forest across the river can be trekked, and you can travel up the river as well. The rock tends to get a bit too hot in the midday sun.

Honestly though, we paid 150 USD for B&B which was a lot, and spent on a few dishes with room service as well. Considering the poor accessibility and lack of good food/beverages. I'm all for premium pricing, when quality doesn't suffer. With a little more work, I'm sure this place could be living up to it's potential.","Good location, but falls short on other things.","2016-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r361349101-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

Unfortunately our visit did not meet our expectations. 

Our car was not ready for dirt road to Hotel from Kithulgala. When we book the hotel we were told there is a secure parking in kitulgala and there is a security guard as well. It turns out secure parking is empty land where buses park and security guard is village man who lives next to it. We were worried about vehicle safety which kinda ruined our time there. 
MAKE SURE YOU COME BY 4x4 or PARK AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

 A+ for location. Middle of forest facing to a river. You feel like you are living in middle of nature with modern luxury. Hardly you see anyone unless you walk to main building so it is very private. 

Staff : very friendly and Helpfull. Nimal who served us most of the time is really nice and friendly. 
They are trying hard but unfortunately little or no experience and little training let things down.

Food : we were happy breakfast and lunch. But dinner was not up to standards. They offered us something else but we were not hungry and lost appetite after we tried. Menu is very limited. No choices with food. There are no other restaurants so you are stuck with what they offer which is very limited. 

Room : very modern and luxury. But lack of maintenance and cleaning make things go down slowly. 
Outside finish is not the best. Should have done better. 

No dental kit. No shaving kit. Had to request. Quality is very low of the dental kit we receive.  

All the Towels were torn. 

Safe was not working. They tried to fix it but nothing fixed till we left the place. 

Sauna is ok but safety switch turns off automatically had to get someone to turn it on.

Bathroom is needs more cleaning. Even though hotel is new dirt build up already in the edges. Seems like no one tried to clean apart from daily housekeeping tasks. 

Overall apart from location there is not much about this place compare with the price.
There are lots of small luxury hotels in sri lanka for this value which offfers lot more. 

Small things which cost very less can bring up the quality. management should pay attention as this place has lot of potential.

Seriously torn towels.. No shaving or dental kit unless you request... For 35000 lkr night hotel ???

The road here from the main road is 7 km on an occasionally very bad road. We were picked up in a worn dies smelling van as it was unable to get around with the car we rented for the trip. How they got here the hotel itself is a mystery! the hotel is super modern with 8 rooms are very luxurious, all facing the river. The main building is completely open and nicely decorated next door is a nice little pool area. We were here for birding but then there are some trails in the forest, it was quite impossible to get through, so the birdwatching was not particularly successful. It included no food except breakfast which is very strange in a place that is so far everything else. The food was in relation to price and quality very expensive, certainly not worth the high cost! There is no alcohol to buy, but it is perfectly possible to bring their own. Despite its luxury outweigh it is not the disadvantages but the hotel is newly opened, so my hope is that there will emerge a great lodge!","boutik hotel in the forest","2016-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r338850173-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

When I called the hotel and got the details and directions, never did they mention anything about the 6.5KM of bad road it takes to get to the hotel after turning off from the main road. With the baby also in the vehicle, in our SUV it took us about 45 minutes to travel this stretch of 6.5kms and halfway through, we almost turned back as well. I saw later that some reviews mention the 4x4 ride that they were offered free of charge but this was never mentioned to us by the hotel and so I thought that it would be important to include this bit of information in my review.

Another thing to mention is that unlike at other hotels once you get there, there's no going out to find a place to eat. It is by all sense of the word a ""retreat"". So plan to have all meals at the hotel itself.

Apart from the above issues, the hotel itself is situated in a beautiful location and the room and the scenery were both stunning. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was as big as the room itself, if not bigger. The sauna and the outdoor heated jacuzzi were 2 of our favorite additions. The food was good but not great. The staff were very friendly and nice and even the manager was friendly and wanted to make our short stay as comfortable as possible. 

Initially even though my rating would've been a lot lower I cannot give it any less than 3 stars due to the scenery, the room facilities and the nice staff. I wish they had informed us about the difficult road and that we were prepared for it but we were not. All in all, I would go there again, with the option of the shuttle service, and would plan to stay for a few days.","Beautiful location!!

Location is good. Food is very good if it is Sri Lankan.  Western foods are ok at best. However guest to staff ratio is inadequate for this price point.  Also, staff need’s training for more professionalism.  Mistakes were made in room service orders and had to call multiple times to get toilet paper.  Also departments such as housekeeping don’t answer the phone.  

Also only lobby, main restaurant and rooms are air conditioned. Rest of the hotel is hot.

Also crows and a cat was roaming in the open bar area.

Is the Spa treatments were good but more care and warmth is needed when interacting with customers.

Très grand complexe avec un environnement extérieur charmant avec vue sur mer. La plage face à l hôtel est moins fréquentée car il est indispensable d avoir des chaussures adaptées dues aux coraux présents au sol. Mais à quelques mètres seulement, une magnifique plage se dessine avec du sable fin et une mer très calme pour adultes et enfants. Pour les amoureux de ballade et de la marche, c est le lieu approprié. Des pêcheurs sont présents au bout de la jetée ainsi que des locaux pechant avec un simple filet,  à proximité.

La chambre est à l image du complexe , spacieuse avec une bonne décoration de style très soignée et idem pour la salle de bains. Petit bémol pour mon cas , ma chambre se situe à proximité de la Réserve des réceptions marchandises et d appareils de ventilations qui occasionnent une nuisances quotidiennes.

The rooms were comfortable, clean, and offered a great view, making the stay pleasant overall. However, the food experience was a huge letdown.

There was no wide spread buffet, which was really disappointing, especially given the location. What was even more frustrating was the complete absence of seafood, which is usually a highlight at seaside hotels. If you are someone who was looking forward to a great seafood buffet, I would not recommend this place. It's not the right choice for seafood lovers.

While the hotel itself is great for relaxing and enjoying the view, the food really needs improvement to match the quality of the accommodations.","Good Rooms and Views, But Disappointing Food","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r988103567-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Strengths 
We had a deluxe sea view - lovely airy room enough for 3 . Spacious bathroom amenities topped up daily . Our room boy Lojanan was great as was maintenance Daaz.
View and sunsets  amazing the hotel is nicely framed by swaying palm trees around the grounds 
Shop was good value - friendly person working there 
We were given an anniversary cake and decorated bed lovely touch 
Overall staff very kind and helpful from restaurant, bar , reception and pool attendants
Hotel clean good evidence lots of maintenance goes on daily .
Laundry service fine 

Negatives
The area outside is rough , dirty rubbish nearby 
The seafood bar  opposite plays music at a ridiculous loud level why ?? 
Whilst the public beach next door didn’t bother us at all , when it was busy there were men hanging about outside hotel  not sure why 
I saw the security guard at the beach drink out of a wine bottle whilst on duty . Even if it was water that should not be happening ! 
The pool hygiene is questionable, I saw a naked toddler in the pool this was ignored 
Crows drinking from the pool . Dirty scum round edge . Questionable chlorine levels. 
Sun bed wars at times you needed to get there before 8.30 am   to get a lounger .
The food!! The quality was inconsistent bones on meat , tough beef. A lot looked the same from previous nights . Saw lots of flies at the outside cooking station some were dead in-between the glass panelling 
I think there was a food  and  beverage  manager walking around , little if any interaction with guests 
Breakfast could be chaotic items not replenished in a timely way . Napkins were at times dirty 
One tourist chose to walk around bare foot at breakfast despite clear etiquette around clothing this was ignored 
Food cold mainly 
Service at honey  beach bar  slow .

In summary
We ate at the Uga  hotel one night and had lunch at Malu Malu  hotel the difference in quality is unmeasurable!
Wished we had trusted our gut and stayed in a high end resort .","I wouldn’t come back ! Disappointed with aspects","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r966773652-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Our housekeeping chap was very helpful and kept the rooms lovely.

Loved sitting at Honey beach early evening with a Ceylonese cocktail watching the sunset.

This is the 4th hotel we stayed in on our trip to Sri Lanka and sadly the worse in terms of food, staff and the pool area.

The staff got friendlier the longer we were there luckily. But for the first few days they were very unfriendly compared to all our other stays. The buffet was manic, at breakfast and dinner - with less choice than previous hotels, things not topped up readily and the majority of dishes luke warm at best. Very disappointing.

The resort got busier and busier into our stay.....then sunbed wars started. There is not enough beds for the number of guests. I did not expect to have to be fighting for a sun bed in Sri Lanka.  The pool isn't great.....very underwhelming, shallow and the ravens are constantly drinking from it and pooping on the edge. Pretty grim!

No mention of a national holiday until we went to the bar and were told no alcohol being served ! Thought they would have at least informed their guests! 

Definitely only 4 star but loved our suite - apart from the child above who constantly ran everywhere sounding like a herd of elephants at all times of the day. After 4 days of putting up with it, Reception tried to help however it didn't improve sadly. 

The beach is lovely, take water shoes and use the public beach for swimming due to coral reefs.","Could be brilliant.......","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r960340608-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The complex is clean, fresh, modern. The family room is a great size. The option to hire jet ski and paddle boards is great and the staff accompanying are polite and attentive. 

The a la carte food is meh. £7.50 plus for a frozen style pizza you pick up in a multi pack at Lidl for £1 sets the standard. That'd despite their being an actual pizza oven that's decorative only. 
Cocktails again meh. Warm when delivered.

Bar staff don't take orders from the seating area. You have to go up to the bar to order. Staff are simply Lethargic, will only act reactively. Nothing pro active. Once you have their attention they will do their job but should you constantly have to chase to be served when your on holiday and its their job. 

Again sunbeds have option for cushions. They are packed away and not put out by staff. You physically have to get yourself or chase the staff. Once caught again they will then get to work. 

Breakfast buffet is limited but ok. Stayed at multiple hotels in Sri Lanka now its fine in comparison. 

Prices don't include tax or service. That's a dated practise and top hotels on the island have combined in published menu price to be more transparent. 

Overall this hotel could be great but the service levels and a la carte options we experienced really let it down.","Great Looks but limited personality","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r946516363-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Инфраструктура практически отсутствует из-за недавно окончившейся войны. От аэропорта Коломбо добираться около 5ч, до всех достопримечательностей тоже будет неблизко. 
Мы брали All Inclusive, питание хорошее. Завтрак и ужин шведский стол. Обед по меню. Можно было найти неострую еду, но сложно. Однако персонал всегда идет на встречу и подсказывает что-то не острое, может поменять блюдо. Вкусные коктейли. 
Пляж у отеля рифовый, там никто не купается. Все идут левее пару сотен метров мимо пляжа, где купаются местные, которые очень любят фотографироваться с европейцами. В итоге купались на пляже  напротив трехзвездочного отеля Marina Beach, там нет рифов, песок, приятный вход.
Обратите внимание, что это залив, волн и силы океана здесь не поочувствовать. Но с детьми наверное самое то. Также в отеле есть детская комната. 
В качестве активности есть бильярд.

1) The location and resort surroundings are really scenic and if you want to just relax on your sun beds and watch the world pass you by, this is the resort for you.
2) Water sports like Kayaking/boat trips/jet ski(accompanied) are available from the hotel’s sports club located on the left. However if you like to do jet ski on your own, or want to do a Padi course(requires 4 days), go further on the left of the hotel on the beach for caters for more water sports. 
3) All the staff were really friendly and would smile and greet you. Every evening, they would deliver one bottle of water per person to your room in addition to one bottle per person left when they clean the room. 
Cons:
1) If you love swimming in the sea, this is not the resort for you as the sea facing the hotel has shallow water with stones and very low reefs making it difficult even to snorkel or swim. On the left side of the hotel, the beach is like a lagoon, but we were not able to use it as it is swamped by locals during Fridays-Sundays when they arrive by tuk tuks or coaches. Further to its left, the beach is long with crystal clear waters. However you are not protected from the sun as there are no sun beds/umbrellas as it’s a public beach. We booked the hotel through a local travel agent who recommended this hotel, but with hindsight we should have stuck with our original selection of Anantaya beach resort as we heard that his was a better location for quite beach access. If you prefer splashing out, Uga Bay resort is the best as per our driver. 
2) Food can be a bit repetitive, but if you don’t like the options, the chefs will be more than happy to something you like with prior notice. 3) it’s a pity they didn’t have live music at the bar in the evening like Cinnamon group of hotels. They would make more money at the bar if they had live music as we didn’t see many guests ordering drinks.","Scenic location but not great for quite beach access","2023-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r921274492-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

2) The room was nice as mentioned
3) The dinner here is awful, it caters to the western tour groups on mass - so very meat centric, on the first night the hotel offered to make something else but we were limited in our options. 
4) The pool is extremely shallow 
5) You need beach shoes to get into the ocean!
6) Vijaykumar served us at breakfast, lunch and dinner and is the only member of staff alert enough to spot we where not happy - he was a really nice young lad who went out of his way to try and make our day.
7) I could not believe the restaurant team knowing our disappointment took the trouble at departure to ask for a positive tripadvisor review!
The beaches and hotels are 3 stars at most in this stretch, go to Tricho for luxury or accept that this underdeveloped (but overpriced)

We found the superior room very rustic, apart from space and the views a deluxe room would have been fine, as we weren’t spending too much time in the room. It was clean and comfortable. The restaurant/ bar service was not great we had to keep going looking for the staff to get fresh drinks in the bar area. The first night we had the buffet for dinner as we had been traveling from Colombo airport and was tired. They catered for my partners gluten free requirements and the buffet was fine. The following evening we thought we would treat ourselves to the a la carte menu. When the food eventually came one of the starters was completely wrong. So we had to wait for the correct one to be prepared, while the other was kept warm some where. During the starters the main was presented, the waiter just stood looking at us, so we pointed out that we were still eating the starter and he took the mains away. When they were brought out for a second time, I had a beef skewer marinated in spices, whilst the flavour was great the beef was really tough and well over done, may be through keeping it warm? I couldn’t eat it and I was offered what I wanted from the buffet as a replacement, what I chose was not much better, but I had lost the will to live at this point! When the bill came the a la carte main was still on it, they eventually took this off when we objected to it. This hotel seems to cater for the larger tour groups and on this evening we’re focused on a private BBQ, so may be distracted! Like others we had spent a lot of money on our trip and was not impressed. Especially after completing our check out they told our private guide to wait while they checked we hadn’t had anything from the minibar, not something we ever experienced before! If we came back to this area I think we would look for an alternative hotel","Disappointing service","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r1001264669-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

The setting was lovely; however the room was very dated with dark shabby furniture. The door to the bathroom and semi open shower had to be kept closed to avoid any insects getting in.  It had a bolt and latch which was very loud when used, particularly in the middle of the night.
Food at dinner was good but very disappointing breakfast with very few hot drinks options ( tasteless coffee and only black tea) and flies around the open food dishes.
Wine was extremely expensive- we were shocked to have to pay more than £39 sterling for a mediocre bottle of Italian white.
Young staff seemed disinterested and not very customer oriented.
We paid a lot of money for this trip of a lifetime and we love Sri Lanka and its people who have been exceptionally warm and welcoming.
Our stay here was the exception which has been a disappointment sadly.","Slightly disappointing","2025-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r1000657396-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

However, we are truly sorry to hear about the disappointment with the food selection and quantity.

The iron board cover needs replacement as it is burnt in so many places. The A/c was not cooling. Didn’t attend to it when we informed but kept disturbing us when we were ready to check out. However, the staff was very apologetic to the fact that it was not fixed on time. The food was the major disappointment. It was the same every day with very little quantities in the serving dishes that you don’t feel like talking any as it is sufficient for just one person. There was no variety at all it is very evident that they are cutting cost in food. Some days there is no buffet and a menu is given to select from. Substandard salad and half or lesser small bowl of soup. I requested for squid with rice and just got 5 small pieces of squid with a large plate of rice. Very substandard and budget. There is absolutely no choice for people who don’t eat Sri Lankan curry. I have to mention that some staff were amazing and friendly and always ready help but maintains the budget food quality as it must be a management decision to cut cost on food.

Les chambres sont agréables.
Le vrai élément décevant est l’ambiance et la restauration. 
L’ambiance est celle d’un “resort tout compris” où une clientèle internationale se croise, matin, midi et soir autour de buffets à volonté sans caractère, d’un restaurant aménagé façon “cantine géante”. 
Bien qu’ayant beaucoup voyagé, je n’ai jamais vu un buffet aussi gigantesque, avec toutes sortes de cuisines internationales ou “locale adaptée à une riche clientèle touristique”. Pour moi c’est une honte à deux titres :
- d’abord c’est réellement indécent d’offrir un tel choix infini, même pour clientèle variée et aisée, dans un pays assez miséreux et où les serveurs doivent doivent être gênés par un tel gaspillage! On passe presque plus de temps à parcourir le buffet qu’à manger. Je n’ose imaginer les montagnes de déchets après chaque repas.
- deuxièmement, à force de privilégier la quantité, on en oublie la qualité. Vous pouvez mélanger à peu près tout et n’importe quoi (fruits, curry, pizza, pates, crêpes, viandes, féculents, légumes, épices, œufs, simili-fromages, 1001 desserts, 1001 trucs d’apéritifs…) et au final, vous obtenez une assiette chargée mais sans saveur. J’ai vraiment regretté les bons restaurants d’hôtels plus intimistes où un chef vous proposait un menu limité mais élaboré et savoureux.
L’impression d’être un cochon qu’il fait gaver midi et soir. Pour qui aime bouffer sans réfléchir pour avoir l’impression de rentabiliser le prix. Mais certains types de touristes aiment ça (notamment les russes, les chinois, les américains).
Pour moi, ce type de restauration est honteux et est tout ce que je fuis.","Beautiful setting but ""holiday club"" atmosphere","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r908918228-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

The check-in process was smooth and without incident. The room was ok, but i did not like the fact that our room had twin beds. I asked about changing the room to one with a King Bed but was only offered a bedsheet to combine them into a single bed. This was very inconvenient for sleeping with a small child in the middle. The swimming pool was also quite dated, There was plaster coming off the sidewalls and this was a potential safety issue as you could get scraped on the side.

The food, on the other hand, was quite delicious and well-prepared. Wimalaratna from the buffet service tried his best to do a good job, but the table service was slow.

This hotel was booked for us by the tour company. It was a surprise when we arrived at the hotel. We were driving through a neighbourhood in what appeared the suburbs of Kandy when the hotel suddenly appeared. The hotel was in a seemingly odd location about 10-15 minute drive from the centre of Kandy however it later made a bit more sense as we drove around the city more over the following days. Kandy has the most unusual layout as the city itself winds around the hills and rivers. For practical purposes, the hotel is isolated and the only way in and out is by taxi or tuk-tuk. There is nothing of interest within walking distance.

The hotel on approach was pleasant. The grounds and the pool area near the reception was quite nice. It was obvious on arrival that it was a bit tired looking but it was only when we got to the room that it was apparent how run-down the hotel was. The room was spacious but it didn't make up for the sagging and uncomfortable beds more befitting a run-down 3-star hotel. The towels in the bathroom were so old that they were all frayed at the edges and the tension in the shower head was so weak that it could not hold itself up under the weight of the water. You had to hold the shower head to have a shower, and that was when there was water pressure which was hit and miss.

The hotel restaurants were mixed. Some meals (such as the New Year buffet) were excellent however the breakfast was hit and miss. Some of the dishes that should have been warm were cold on multiple mornings and it was a food poisoning risk.

The gym was reasonable, if a bit dated but sufficed for a few days. One of the stand out features of the hotel was the lovely pool and surrounding grounds - it was pleasant. That however was not able to make up for what should be a nice hotel but just in desperate need of renovation.","In real need of an update","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r988468925-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

However, Ms. Nadeesah, the  stewardess , kindly encouraged us to enjoy the buffet and assured us that she would bring some food items to our table to save time. . She fulfilled her promise, allowing us to finish our meal in just 40 minutes. If we had followed the initial advice from the reception, we might not have had the opportunity to  have th breakfast  at your hotel and would have left looking for another hotel in Kandy. 
Ms. Nadeesah's exceptional business acumen was instrumental in our decision to stay back for the buffet. Your esteemed hotel, like many others in Sri Lanka, would greatly benefit from more staff members like  Nadeesha the stewardess , who use their common sense to attract guests. We also observed her assisting other foreign guests who arrived late, ensuring they could enjoy the morning buffet as well.

As Sri Lanka strives to promote tourism and boost foreign revenue, it is essential to encourage and support dedicated individuals like Ms. Nadeesah. We wish her all a all the luck !!
We aslos wish to  mention  that the food was quite good and the Hopper makers were helpful. However  as we had overstayted for 5 minutes one steward  informed us that time is up signalling us to leave.  I wish that this gentleman could have used a much more polite tone !!

This is beautiful hotel in an amazing location. When you arrive you feel as though you are in a top class hotel. We stayed three nights on half board and the problems all surrounded mealtimes. Breakfast and dinner were both buffets. Each day we were there coach parties who seemed to be on one night stays. They would check in before dinner at 7.30pm and the buffet became a free for all. Cultural differences visitors don’t explain bad manners and parents allowing their children to handle food other diners are supposed to eat. After the first evening we decided to wait until 9pm when the coach parties seemed to disappear but there was little we could do to improve the breakfast experience. The staff who were excellent during the day when the hotel was quiet were completely overwhelmed and seemed very uncomfortable with what was going on. The food when you could get to it was very good - the sad thing was the bun fight that had to be endured to eat it. The only other comment is that this hotel is not well located for getting in and out of Kandy. Unlike other hotels visited on or trip tuk tuk drivers were not waiting outside and when asked how we should travel in and out of the city we were told to download the PickMe app (similar to Uber) rather than the front desk offering to call transport for us.

Rooms - Seerock is a concrete jungle. It felt like they have built a hotel in a desert. Rooms are very well furnished with modern amenities, but not with an elegant taste. It is too cluttered with furnitures. They have a Jacuzzi, which is crazily aligned to the main door. No view, just a small balcony. Rooms are not worth for the price. 

Service and Food - Service is wonderful. Starting for the check in process, Seerock is blessed with some wonderful people.

Thank you for your review.  I must say that we really do wish you did tell us, directly, to us the staff of myself as the Resident Manager. 

We noticed that you have got disturbed to see the power lines that runs on the side of our property, however they are under the ownership of the government and the Electricity Board of Sri Lanka. 

The local travel partner who organised your tour, Jetwing, is one of the largest in the country. It is one of our biggest partners and no doubt funnels us a significant amount of business. As such the driver guide who transported you is a multiple visitor.  it was he who requested that very accommodation, choosing a quiet place over the accommodation provided on site at the hotel. Furthermore, the accommodation provided to him was at a property 50 meters from the hotel, a place that many driver guides stay at. If your driver guide had an issue with his accommodation, it would have been in his best interest to keep us informed instead burdening you, the guest, with that problem.

We apologize that the food was not to your liking however a simple mention would have had them changed right away or exchanged for something more to your liking. You ordered 4 dishes, and your total was $ 31, inclusive of mandatory government taxes and service charge so in reality you bill was only $ 24 + taxes.  

We serve 3 types of bacon at the hotel, taking into consideration our clientele. Back Bacon ( Pork ), Beef Bacon, Chicken Bacon. If you were not served the above then we apologize and we will address the communication issue with the restaurant.

Finally thank you for the positive feedback on the staff, rooms and internet. I am happy we were at least able to salvage and do something right during your stay. 
So while I am sorry that your stay could have been better, and certainly wish it could have been, some of the issues were really beyond our control. As for the rest we will take in under consideration. I once again humbly request that issues and grievances be brought to the attention of management, without resorting to using online review sites, via which no real problem can be solved especially after a check out. 

We wish you a pleasant stay during the rest of your time in Sri Lanka.

Best wishes,
Alec van Cuylenburg

This proved to be a portent of things to come at Seerock. Some of the lights were on but not everyone was home. But I’m getting ahead of myself. As a travel writer, I get paid to share my opinions with readers in the Asia-Pacific region as well as some North American publications, but this time around it felt necessary to issue a caveat emptor to those considering a stay here. The good things first and there are several. The staff could not be more courteous, friendly and welcoming. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and luxurious. The internet is robust. Three big ticks there. Now for the bad news. While the remote setting is tranquil, as are the water gardens, the massive set of power lines running through the place detracts from the serenity like, well, a massive set of power lines running through a property. Okay, perhaps I should have looked more closely at the images. Where this resort falls down in a massive way is the food. If you are going to charge in US$ in a country where cheap, fresh and flavorful fare is abundant, you need to deliver. The food at Seerock is none of these things. A meal of samosas, a dozen minuscule garlic prawns, bread and dhal patties we christened Clint Eastwood on account of their toughness was billed at a massive $41. The surrounding areas are bristling with restaurants where you can taste the pride in every mouthful - the predominant flavor here is a slipshod gouge for cash. The best you can say about the breakfast offering is that it’s adequate but don’t ask for bacon as you’ll get a slice of fried spam which curls at the edges as if rearing up from itself. Like many travelers to this region, we had a driver/guide from the Jetwing company (highly recommended btw). His accommodation was guilt-inducingly appaling. The drivers of guests simply deserve better. Most of the negative feedback on this page has received a “we wish you said something while you were here” response, so Seerock, here we are, down the lane with two more nights booked. Anyone reading this review, I’ll do an edit including their response. Let’s see what happens...","Think twice","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r560803672-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",
