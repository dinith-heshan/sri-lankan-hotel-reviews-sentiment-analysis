However I bit into what was served only to find both were completely bland, without salt. Sent back to rectify, still was the worst grilled veggies I've had.

Thank you for your stay at Uppuveli Beach by DSK. We are delighted to hear your positive feedback about our friendly staff and culinary offerings. Regarding your comments on the unavailability of Spa and Laundry services, we have not advertised a Spa on any online travel portals or our website. We do provide laundry services through an external provider which we clearly communicate at the time of any service request. Being a brand-new resort, our own state-of-the-art laundry facility is currently in progress at a location closer to resort and will be fully in operation soon.

Luckily the hotel was quiet as we were the only guests which was good for us to relax. 

On the positive side :
- Food was fresh and excellent (too bad your lady cook is leaving)
- Service from Gavin efficient (but sometimes too ‘present’)
- Rooms clean 
- hotel well located in town but in a residential quiet area.

On the negative note :
- the temperature of hot water in our shower was too high and burning . The water taps were not efficient to use and mis functionning and the temperature was not stabilised. I asked them too fix it.
- we experienced an electric short circuits then the lamps bulbs exploded while in the bathroom so the situation was pretty dangerous . Of course run out of electricity. We had to call Gavin to find a solution as we could not stay in our rooms. We then had to pack again and move to other rooms in the main building.
- also in our initial rooms, in the bathroom , an indoor wood made window was positioned towards the corridor so you can hear all the noises and as such the bathroom didn’t felt intimate at all and cold ! It was worth in the second room as the same window had two open panels for ventilation which you could not shut. The temperature was 12 deg Celsius at night so the bathroom was not inviting considering the weather there (cold and rainy during our stay)
- on check in , no one explained how was working the heating system which in fact is a AC unit. So we were cold the first night (the weather was then terrible with great win and rain falls). We found out after moving to the second room but quickly turned it off as it was too noisy!
- as well I don’t understand why they choose to install such heavy doors everywhere occurring unnecessary noise while opening and shutting! I cannot imagine the noise level in the building whenever the hotel is full! 

I believe this hotel has potential but they still have to work in their infrastructure (electricity, plumber, et ) to avoid complicated stays for the guests.","Not as expected","2022-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d23864787-r854982845-Chimneys_Nuwara_Eliya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The hotel looks grand and opulent from the outside and is a very nice part of the city. The reception area matches the appearance of the outside. However the service we received didn't match the grandeur.

It took us 20 minutes to check in with very little in terms of communication from the person checking us in. Once we been given the key card and told our room number that was it. No directions to the lift, no information about our luggage - nothing. I had to come back down to the lobby to get our luggage. First world problems I admit but not what I would expect from ""the best hotel in Colombo"".

The rooms were OK. Clean and nicely appointed but the little details let it down. Badly painted ceilings (going over fittings), old carpet, lights in the wardrobe not working, no minibar or complimentary water.

Service in the buffet restaurant, Harbour, was equally poor. It was self service buffet but ordering and receiving a drink took over 20 minutes from sitting down. 

The Sky lounge was the only exception. We got excellent service in this bar and the selection of drinks was good as well (no draught beer though).

This certainly isn't one of the worst hotels but it was the worst one compared to all of the other hotels we stayed at in our 2 week tour.

Check in took ages but we were upgraded. However things went downhill from there. The extreme  noise from the pool area starts around 430pm & doesn’t abate until 11pm nightly. The hotel is very upmarket in all other areas. For example, in the lobby area they have someone playing on the piano which is quite nice. The noise from the pool is unacceptable. Room windows are not glazed & even on level 8 the noise was incredibly loud. Not only that we were treated quite poorly by the staff. Someone knocked on our door to do a “room check“ when we had slept in but in fact we felt like they were checking on us. I purchased two glasses of champagne to take to the room, I signed for them and then was yelled at in the lobby by one of the staff from the bar telling me that I had to pay cash as it could not be posted to the room, even though I had signed for the drinks, I complained to the manager who sent to cupcakes to the room (!), but then the same thing happened only hours later when my husband’s very late laundry arrived in the room at 8pm as we were walking out and we were asked to pay cash as again it “could not be posted” to the room. We complained to the night manager but it’s simply not good enough. This never happens to us in any other hotel and we do travel extensively around the world. We provided our credit card at check-in. When we complained we were then told that the dry cleaning and the bars were all run separately.  So what? Also, the food & drinks are extremely overpriced ie Australian Oyster Bay worth AUD$17 is a whopping AUD$95 in their restaurants! I also got bitten by a bug that was in the pool which is in desperate need of repair, although fairly clean. There’s only about 10 deck chairs in the pool area, not enough for the amount of guests in the hotel
Beds were comfortable, the room was adequate and clean but the blinds didn’t close up so there’s a lot of light coming in to the room.","Extreme NOISE from pool every night","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r987716913-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

However, the entire experience was tanked by the nightclub they seem to prioritize out at the pool.  Based on the postings in the elevator, it runs until midnight.  I had a 4:30 am flight and was trying to get some sleep prior to leaving the hotel at 12:00 am.  No such luck.  I was on the 4th floor above the pool, and up until I left it sounded like I had a DJ at the foot of my bed.  It was SO loud.  I was not alone in my complaints - the rest of my group hated the experience as well.  

Recommendation to management: pick a lane - upscale travelers retreat or downmarket nightclub.  If you can't decide, go for a third option - turn down the music and shut it off earlier.  I would recommend management try and sleep with it as it is now to really understand the experience you are offering your guests.","Nightclub not Sleep","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r983171956-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We were a group of 6 and our passports were taken. We then just waited for over 20 minutes with no one telling us what was going on. Finally, when we complained, there was some excuse given about rooms. The chaos in the reception area continued all day and we were told there were 3 weddings and a corporate event being held, all at the same time! It did get better the next day. 

Our “pool view” room actually overlooked a car park, but if we squeezed into a corner near the window we could catch a glimpse of the pool! Our room had a cupboard door saying mini bar but there wasn’t even a fridge behind it. There appeared to have been a shortage of hand towels as all our group only received one between two people.

On the plus side, the breakfast was excellent. The room service staff were pleasant as were those at the reception desk. We had an early start and were provided with a good packed breakfast .

Houskeeping operator of evening hour is very rude  for some reason.  I tried Ordering some bottle of water to the Front office operator, houskeeping and in room  dining  thrice but they just wouldnt give me water even when I tried odering for  paid bottles. Spa is mediocre. Rooms need deep cleaning.Also, the rooms had human hairs lying around wash basin / shower cubicle. Houskeeping  ringing bell from 7 am for making room was also kind of inappropriate.  Tv internet is super slow.

Since our return we observed, the standard was not as we expected as our last time, there were one or two people who had time for us and we felt we were not appreciated as returning guests. to start with our room was basic and water was leaking from the drainage in the toilet giving us a terrible stench at times. The breakfast was fine, but the food served was cold and wasn't up to the standards. Overall the hotel location is great, accessible to restaurants, beach and the One Gallface Mall. Apart from this we are not at all impressed with the hotel, and the treatment we received.  Also as our flight was in the evening we asked for a late checkout, until 4 pm, but they insisted that if we stayed any longer than 3pm there will be added charges, despite us being away on our travels although we had already paid for our room for two weeks. However I'm very disappointed and I don't think we will come here again.","Not a good experience at Kingsbury Hotel Colombo","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r966977126-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

I travelled from Galle and pampered myself to a two night stay at The Kingsbury. 

The hotel is grand and very welcoming to smiling faces of staff working there and showering their warm hospitality upon everyone. The hotel was busy which was great for the business and team were on their toes to ensure a great experience for everyone staying or visiting. 
 
Coming to the positives - 

1. Food was outstanding everywhere. Tried 4-5 outlets throughout the stay and the food and hospitality at the F&B outlets was divine specially at Yue Chuan and Tenku. The F&B team was great and chefs really definitely did put their heart and soul into the cooking.

2. Spa at the hotel was amazing. Really professional therapists and the team at the reception was truly welcoming and ensured a great experience during the therapies. I did have a suggestion and have already mentioned it to the spa team and that is to keep some loofahs at the spa on request for those guests to do choose to take a shower there itself. 

3. Gymnasium was well equipped and definitely maintained to a great standard.

Unfortunately there were a few hiccups as well. 

1. First and foremost , I was actually given a key to an occupied room on arrival. The guest occupying the room was lady and she was getting her makeup done when I walked in assuming she must be at the hotel for an event. However it was very embarrassing for both of us as she was in the middle of getting ready and I just invaded her privacy unknowingly. I definitely apologised for the inconvenience and went back to the reception and did let the team know. They mentioned that due to Houskeeping’s negligence, the room was marked ready as per their system. I hope they did speak to the guest and made sure everything was fine ! It was surely a very big inconvenience to the guest occupying the room and myself ! Unfortunately nothing was done post that by the team with regard to the same. 

2. I had placed my order for lunch through room service upon arrival in the new room  however the team member who delivered the food requested for the payment to be done at the same time rather than posting it to the room. It was actually the case for all the outlets I visited and none of them billed the checks to the room. Unfortunately not all the in-house guests like to carry their credit cards along to every space of the hotel they visit. Looked quite odd but that might just be the hotel policy unfortunately it was not informed upon arrival. 

3. I had placed an order through the beach club for lunch on the day of departure which took about an hour and a half to be delivered to the room. I had reconfirmed with the employee at the beach club about the delivery and he over excitedly mentioned to have it served without an issue within 20-25 minutes. However after two follow-ups once through the reception and second through the room service, the order was finally served.

There were a few ups and downs about The Kingsbury however overall what I had heard off about the service and hospitality unfortunately that little spark was missing which could have definitely elevated the entire stay experience i was hoping for !","Hit and miss experience at the icon of Colombo !","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r966882388-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Aufgrund der Werbung als Strandhotel erwartet man Liegen am Strand, die jedoch nicht zum Hotel gehören, sondern von Einheimischen vermietet werden. Der Strand selbst war schön, sauber, absolut ruhig ohne Touristentrubel und Spaziergänge entlang des Strandes möglich. Eine einzelne Strandverkäufern, die ihre Ware aber unaufdringlich angeboten hat.
Vom Hotel selbst waren wir etwas enttäuscht und von der Sheraton-Familie Besseres gewohnt. Begonnen hat es bei der Ankunft, nachmittags gegen 15:15 angekommen mussten wir fast eine Stunde im Reception-Bereich warten, da das Zimmer nicht fertig war. Abgesehen vom gewohnten Begrüssungsgetränk wurde während der längeren Wartezeit nichts weiter angeboten. Dann endlich im Zimmer angekommen gab es für das Beistellbett noch keine Bettwäsche und einen dritten Sessel für den Balkon mussten wir extra anfordern, am dritten Tag bereits das Duschgel leer.
Was aber besonders unangenehm aufgefallen ist war, dass  die Sanitäranlagen im Poolbereich im Hinblick auf Reinlichkeit zu wünschen übrig lassen. So etwas sollte in 5-Sterne-Hotels keinesfalls passieren!
Positive Aspekte:  Das Essen in Buffetform morgens und abends war ausgezeichnet, mit jeweils sehr großer Auswahl und in guter Qualität. Die Angestellten sehr zuvorkommend und bemüht.
An Sportangeboten haben wir täglich Wassergymnastik mitgemacht, der Vorturner war sehr nett und hat die Stunde auch immer sehr lustig abgehalten. 
Besonders hervorzuheben waren die Yoga-Einheiten, der Trainer war immer sehr bemüht und ist auf die Teilnehmer einzeln eingegangen.
Fazit: Gutes Hotel mit ein paar Mankos, die sicherlich verbessert werden können.","Gutes Hotel, sind aber von 5-Sterne-Hotels Besseres gewohnt","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r998408917-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Greetings from Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort!

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We're happy to hear that you enjoyed the beautiful beach and found our staff friendly and accommodating. However, we truly appreciate you bringing the other aspects of your stay to our attention.

We’d like to clarify that shower gel is provided in a pump bottle as part of our sustainable initiative to reduce waste. We understand that this may not have been clear, and we will make sure to communicate this better in the future.

Regarding the beach loungers, these are provided by local villagers as part of their livelihood, which is why there is a charge to use them. We hope you understand that this is an arrangement that supports the local community. However, we do offer ample sun loungers by the pool and in the garden for our hotel guests, free of charge, for a relaxing experience.

We also apologize for the issue with pool loungers being reserved without use. This is something we are actively working on addressing to ensure a more relaxed and enjoyable environment for all our guests.

Thank you again for your comments, and we hope to welcome you back for an even better experience next time.

Best Regards,
Sahan","1152","791440478","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/2c/6c/5e/caption.jpg","2048",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 Okanda Road, Hiddaruwa, Naape Hiddaruwa, Naape, Kosgoda 80570 Sri Lanka","Kosgoda","Sri Lanka","80570",,"1 Okanda Road, Hiddaruwa, Naape","Hiddaruwa, Naape","19761154","6.333253","Kosgoda, Galle District, Southern Province","80.02986","Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort","1171","4.7","31","23","30","112","975","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499082-d19761154-Reviews-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/cmbst-sheraton-kosgoda-turtle-beach-resort/overview/","2025-03-02","MOBILE","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wir wollten ein schönes Hotel am Strand und das würde ja passen

dann so gut wie nichts frei und nur 40% der Liegen sind wirklich besetzt

Но! Если если ехать в этот отель, то только на все включено. Во-первых, потому что он значительно отдален от таких курортов, как Бентота и Хиккадува. Во-вторых, цены на обед на двоих (по одному блюду и напитку) от 3 000 р. А в ресторане, в котором шведский стол фикса - 4000 р за обед на двоих. Еда абсолютно обычная, отельная, практически нет морепродуктов. Нас поселили на 2м этаже, с видом на детский бассейн (не критично), на балконе практически не проводили время. Но за $1000 предложили переехать на этаж выше, мы отказались. Номера просторные, приятные. Уборка регулярная. Но у нас была теневая сторона, купальники не сохли и не было даже веревочки на балконе, раскладывала на уличные кресла. Территория отеля небольшая. Хорошего размера бассейн и практически безлюдный. Пляж отличный, но опять же, поблизости нет ровным счетом ничего. Волны всегда большие, поэтому спасал бассейн. Персонал отеля приветливый и приятный, но практически никто не знает русский. Есть доступ на крышу здания, от туда офигенный вид на океан и джунгли. Отдельно спасибо официанту Avishka, приятный улыбчивый молодой человек. А ещё будьте готовы, что к любому счету добавят налог+чаевые 30%, и если вы поели на 15 000 рупий, то заплатите 20 000 рупий.

Vorab das Positive. Die Jungs von der Poolbar, Gayan, Nuintha und ihr Boss, waren spitze. Die Kochstationen und das dortige Personal ebenso. Generell gehörte das Personal zu dem aufmerksamsten und besten, welches wir auf unserer Reise erlebt haben. 
Der Strand ist bombastisch. Ziemlich sauber und vor allem leer. In der Nähe sind keine größeren Hotels. Abends spielen die Einheimischen Beachvolleyball und nehmen einen freudig auf. Man wird zwar von ein paar Verkäufern angesprochen, jedoch nicht aufdringlich.
Die Zimmer sind großzügig und sauber.

Die negativen Punkte. 
Sollte ihr Zimmer auf der Ostseite liegen, lassen Sie sich mindestens eines im zweiten Stockwerk geben, denn im Erdgeschoss sind private Pools mit entsprechender Geräuschkulisse. 
Das Hotel ist von einem Wassergraben und viel Natur umgeben. Sobald die Dämmerung eintritt, ist Insektenschutz nötig.
Das Essen war zwar reichhaltig, international und lokal, jedoch kalt.
Für Gäste mit unangenehmen Gewohnheiten und Manieren, wie Russen und Chinesen, kann das Hotel zwar nichts, manchmal habe ich mir jedoch einen Aufruf zur Mäßigung gewünscht.
Terminierte Aktivitäten wie Sport haben selten stattgefunden und die Rooftopbar war leider während unseres gesamten Aufenthaltes geschlossen.","Höhen und Tiefen","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r933686292-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

All their rooms have only a partial Ocean View with most of them having the view of Mangroves and a small view of the Ocean. The hotel is misleading customers by advertising a Ocean View. Only their suites have a complete Ocean View. 

That being said, the hotels location is by the beach, it has a wonderful and large pool and the food is superb, be it breakfast or dinner. 
The rooms are fine, though my room had a clogged overflowing bathroom and despite complaining and the personnel trying to rectify the situation, the bathroom was still overflowing.

However, others in our group were pretty happy with their rooms, except for the Ocean View part, which we felt ripped off, and have deducted 2 stars for that.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to provide this feedback. We greatly appreciate your input.
And, we would like to address the concerns you raised during your stay.

 As my team informed you on-site, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the matter you mentioned. Our findings, however, indicate that there might have been a misunderstanding regarding the situation.

I would like to clarify that our hotel does not offer an all-inclusive meal plan. Your agent reserved a room for you on Full Board basis, which covers three meals—Dinner on the arrival day, followed by breakfast and lunch on the subsequent day. To accommodate your preference, and as a gesture of goodwill, we offered you lunch instead of breakfast on the following day incurring an internal cost.

Our standard check-in time is 3pm. Nevertheless, we were pleased to arrange an early check-in and had the rooms prepared ahead of time. Our commitment is to prioritize the comfort and satisfaction of our valued guests, and our team works diligently to uphold this standard.

The delay in the check-in process was due to a delay on the part of your agent in finalizing the reservation and payment. We took every measure to ensure your comfort during this time, extending all possible assistance until your agent completed the booking process. Ideally, such procedures should be completed in advance, similar to how they are handled for our other guests.

We acknowledge your feedback regarding the dining time. In line with standard practices at upscale hotels, we inform our guests of the dining hours to ensure that everyone has ample time to enjoy the buffet service before it concludes.
As part of the world's largest Hospitality Company, we adhere to strict guidelines regarding food safety and health. 
Cooked meals are served and disposed of within approved timeframes. Our buffet service does not exceed four hours, and any refilling is carried out under the supervision of experienced professionals. The removal of food adheres to Marriott International standards, as it is our hotel's policy.

We consistently strive to comprehend the unique preferences of each guest, as your satisfaction remains our top priority. I am always happy to personally meet with guests, provided I am available on-site, and discuss any matters if time allows during your stay.

Your comments have been duly noted and shared with my team for potential improvements. Our ongoing goal is to make a positive impact through exceptional service, and we regret that you did not fully experience the renowned hospitality that Marriott is known for on this occasion.

We sincerely hope you continue to enjoy the current stay with us and to have the opportunity to welcome you back.

От этого отеля ожидала гораздо больше. Это моя 26 страна, в последние годы отдыхаем в отелях такой же ценовой категории. 
Началось с заезда. Приехали, нас оформили, попросили подождать пока не готов номер. Ок. Не сезон, низкая загрузка, но приготовить 3 номера вовремя невозможно. У нас все включено. Время 13.30, в последний раз ели вечером в самолете. Сотрудники сообщили, что если мы пообедаем сейчас, они нас не будут кормить завтраком. Это просто невероятно, то есть если нам задержат вылет, то в этот день нас кормить не будут, только за деньги. Почему то, что люди не будут есть, когда едут на экскурсии, они не считают. 
Далее по поводу работы заезда. В 15 часов сотрудники сделали нам сообщение, что от турагента нет оплаты, они нас не заселят. Никаких предложений, полное равнодушие. Пару, которая приехала с нами заселили. Пока мы выясняли, поднимали всех на ноги, платеж нашелся, нас заселили в 16 часов. Отельный гид сказал, что они просто не успели подготовиться, ведь накануне было воскресенье. Никаких извинений, никакого сочувствия даже от главного менеджера не было, всем все равно. Даже в нищей танзании и бедной кубе такого отношения я не встречала. 
Кормят вкусно, наливают местные напитки, средне. Еду, номера описали верно во всех предыдущих отзывах. Номера хорошие, новые. Отель очень маленький, особо там делать нечего. 
Еще маленькая ремарка, характеризующая отношение. На обеде в 14.45 всех обошли сотрудники, сообщив, что столовая закрывается в 15.00. Видимо, тех кто не успел, выведут) 
Все- таки первое знакомство с нацией начинается с общения с сотрудниками отеля. Сейчас могу сказать, что в мире много стран, где за эти деньги можно отдохнуть с большим комфортом, с лучшим отношением. Я больше не вернусь однозначно и советовать эту страну никому не буду, если отель такого уровня так относится к гостям.","Неоднозначный отель","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r908739764-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We arrived at the hotel at around 12 noon and told our room wasn't ready yet.  We decided to visit one of the nearby turtle hatcheries while we waited as it was only a few minutes up the beach from the hotel.   This visit only took about 20 mins as they usher you through very quickly and the beach area is very dirty with a lot of litter and glass so we returned to the hotel and sat in the pool bar to continue waiting.  Service was quite slow as the hotel seems to offer an all inclusive option as well as standard guests (and we didn't have a room number yet to add our drinks to).

Our room was available at 2pm and we collected our keys from reception.  We had been upgraded to a Junior Suite which had a great view over the pool  and had an extra lounge area.  Bed was very comfortable and good wardrobe space.  There was a safe in the room however it didn't work.  

We spent a bit of time at the pool which is huge and was relatively quiet until about 5pm.  Towels are provided and there are plenty of sunloungers.

When we had booked the hotel we had understood the hotel to have a number of restaurants and bars, however the  pool bar only really offered snacks and the main restaurant is a buffet restaurant for the All Inclusive guests so not really what we wanted.  We saw a sign advertising a Happy Hour offer so decided to check it out... however we were the only people there in an odd conference suite set-up with 2 different sets of music playing and slow service.

We went to the SHO Lounge in the reception area for dinner as it advertised a Tapas menu.  Realistically it has a small menu of bar type food of which we ordered a starter to share and burgers each as a main course.  My husbands burger arrived.  He ate as it was already going cold (with overcooked fries).  I chased our other food.  Our starter then arrived.  Then finally my burger arrived.  Really poor service and no apology.

This was a 1 night stay and opportunistic to see the turtles (which the experience is really not worth it) and reduce our travel time back to the airport for an early flight.  The rooms and the pool are nice enough, however the F&B offering in the hotel is a disaster and this is important when you have a hotel in the middle of nowhere!  Quite honestly if I had to book it again, I wouldn't.

That was very rude behavior of that lady. I called them up thrice after which they sent. We never expected such sort of an attitude.

Dinner at the Golden Dragon on 8th was adequate but not a patch on the normal Taj standard. My birthday was on the 9th, and we planned a relaxed SPA day, but it was not to be.......I cannot recall any Taj hotel I stayed at in Bombay, Goa, Rajasthan or anywhere else, where there wasn't a wonderful spa. This hotel was pathetic, with one therapist and only for a male client. We certainly would not have stayed 3 days if we knew this in advance!!! on the whole very disappointed. I think even Vivanta at the airport where we stayed on 15th was far better. The service does not deserve to one in the Taj hotel group.

Additionally, the room was in need of maintenance — the drawer handle had fallen off, and the drawers were in poor condition, posing a safety risk. I was also given a room on a renovated floor, but the addition of a bathtub wasn’t a great option as it took up unnecessary space and wasn’t functional for me.

On a positive note, the restaurant offered a great selection of food, and the variety was delicious.

The overall experience was very average and not up to the standards of Taj or a 5-star hotel.  First the positives: the pool and gym are great.  The check-in process was made remarkable by the unhelpfulness and attitude of the person at the check-in. It was almost as if she was uninterested in us and in answering any questions.  The room itself was okay, good view of Galle Face and the ocean but a little dated, and soon we discovered a number of issues - two outlets did not work, the fridge didn't work, the AC didn't cool, there was no kettle, etc. The maintenance person came by and tried to fix most of these or found some workaround. However, the experience got more bizarre as they seem to have a policy of rationing the towels.  On one day we were given no towels whatsoever and had to call to get more.  On other days we were not given enough towels.  We then ordered some sparkling water and asked the person to leave the bottle opener so we could open the bottles.  He said it was policy to not leave a bottle opener!  I understand that they may have their reasons, but it seems ridiculous to stay at a 5-star hotel and have to worry about there not being enough towels in the room, or not being left a bottle opener.  Finally, the food was moderate - the kids enjoyed the chicken nuggets but the dinner buffet was nowhere near what the other 5-star hotels in Colombo have to offer.  Overall I was really looking forward to our stay at the Taj but it was a very underwhelming experience, I would not stay here again.","Wouldnt go back","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r982670016-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Nonetheless, we are delighted that you found our staff and concierge to be the main asset of our hotel.

My wife wiped the cloths rack used to dry clothes and the cloth was so dirty it was beyond belief. The alternative room was a little better and we decided to make the best of things.
The restaurant was of a reasonable quality given that it was the international buffet variety.
The staff were the main asset of this hotel. They went out of their way to be helpful and the concierge was excellent. Be aware the tuck tuck fixer on the door is open to significant negotiation. He offered us one journey at 7,000 rupees but when challenged dropped it to 5,000 and even this was on the high side.

We are sorry to hear about the aspects of your stay that did not fully meet your expectations. Our intention is always to provide a perfect balance of relaxation and entertainment, and we regret to hear that our entertainment lineup seemed repetitive. We appreciate your suggestion for a greater variety and will certainly consider how we might diversify our performances to enhance the atmosphere. 

Regarding your experience with the 'garden' room view, we understand that it did not live up to your expectations.

We recognize that the additional cost for the upgrade was not ideal, and we will re-evaluate our room allocation process to better match guest expectations with our offerings. 

On the matter of the all-inclusive menu ordering process and wristbands, we apologize for any inconvenience caused. Your comments are invaluable to us as we continually refine our guest experience. We will look into these aspects to ensure smoother and more comfortable dining and leisure experiences for our guests. The upkeep of our beach area is typically of a high standard, and we are disappointed to learn of the litter issue you encountered. We will address this promptly to ensure our beach continues to be an inviting and pristine environment for all guests.

We are pleased that you found our hotel to be lovely, enjoyed the quality of our food, and experienced the friendly and attentive nature of our staff. It is always a pleasure to receive positive remarks about our team's customer service, as we aim to make every guest's stay memorable.

The hotel itself is lovely, the food is decent, and the staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive.

However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made to enhance the guest experience. For example, the entertainment schedule wasn’t clearly advertised. While the live singers and bands were talented, the sets felt repetitive, with the same songs being performed every night. A bit more variety would really elevate the atmosphere.

A word of advice to future guests: avoid booking a ‘garden’ room. The view from ours was quite unpleasant, and despite raising the issue with the staff, the alternative rooms offered had either the same or worse views. We ultimately paid for a room upgrade at $25 per night, which improved our experience significantly, but it’s a shame we had to do so to fully enjoy our stay.

One small inconvenience we encountered was being asked for our room number and to sign a receipt every time we ordered food or drinks from the all-inclusive menu. While minor, it became a bit tiresome over time.

Another point to mention is the all-inclusive wristbands. They were surprisingly sharp, and we found ourselves having to modify them to avoid constant scratching.

It would also be helpful if the hotel advertised that you can order from the all-inclusive menu at the à la carte restaurant between 3-6pm. We stumbled upon this by chance, but clearer communication on this perk would be appreciated.

Lastly, while the hotels beach was well maintained, the area directly next to it was littered with rubbish. This really detracted from the beach experience, and we only visited once because of it.

Overall, we had an enjoyable stay, and with a few adjustments, this could be an even better hotel experience.","Enjoyable stay with room for improvement.","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r973959715-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Hence, my husband hardly enjoyed the breakfast. Regarding LIVE cooking station there were long queues since only 1 staff on each was preparing. Though many management/supervisors going around yet did not pay attention for it and resolve the problem.
Pool - on our last day there was extremely high music played just on the edge of Pool Bar towards the pool.
Room - there were some toiletries missing so we had to request.
Dinner in A-la-carte restaurant - my husband ordered Pork Chops, and he received a pork chop not only thinker than 0.2 centimeter but 80% of it was full of bones and fat. He shown that to the waiter & supervisor. They seen it and offered another one, but my husband refused. Then when the bill presented, they did not remove it, then my husband asked do I have to pay for 20% meat & for tiny bit of vegetables?? Then only they said we will remove the item from the bill.

When we reserved it was mentioned on the Booking.com that late check-out is possible if rooms available. When we were there, we were told by staff only 60% occupied since it was ""off season"" in that area.
Since we were coming to Colombo for another few day’s holiday we wanted to spend bit more time in the Pool, so requested a late check-out, just 2 hrs. more.
Receptionist we asked about it said he will come back to us since the Manager is having his meal at that time, and he is only one know rooms allocation (a strange comment?). We told him we are going to the Pool now (it was around 10:30 hrs.) still he said he will find us & inform. He never turned up, then 30 mts. before normal check-out time i.e. 12:00 I walked to the Reception with bathing cloths to find him to understand whether we can or cannot. He was not there, and another receptionist said the hotel is fully booked, so we have to check-out at 12:00 hrs. That time we had only 20 mts. left to go to the room, have shower, pack & leave the room. While we were rushing in the room another Receptionist called 5 mts. before 12:00 & said we have to check-out at 12:00 hrs. We said that is what we are trying.
We were very disappointed & annoyed that the 1st Receptionist who we talked did not bother to inform us in advance it is not possible to late check-out (though half of the hotel was empty), but was very much busy in rushing us out from the room.","Disappointed with food & service though the Hotel is a nice property","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r964578872-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

I know this is important to the hotel so I will start with a few words on the staff who are out of this world, they genuinely care about making guest experiences as best as possible. I would specifically call out the bar staff, pool guys, beach/garden and the restaurant team. Collectively and individually outstanding. 

It is no way a 5 star resort, it’s 4 on a good day and a million miles away from what Barcelo describe.

Postives

The staff - as mentioned above the best.
The beach - although you have to get over being approached by people trying to sell you a river cruise that literally hang around the gate leading to the beach/sea, an assortment of wild dogs that are super friendly and a family of cows.  The beach itself is stunning as are the sunsets.  Just be very careful in the sea as massive rip tides which saw a number of swimmers needing rescuing.
The food at the SIPPI restaurant and amazing service from Anthony and Madu.

I also want a say a massive thank you to all the staff who arranged for a birthday celebration on the beach. Beyond memorable.

Areas of improvement 

The food.  If you go all inclusive I know it can differ from hotel to hotel so to avoid any misunderstanding this is what TUI offers from their website

You can pick from a trio of restaurants, including a buffet place.

Or Barcelo who proudly state 

You will be amazed by the exclusive culinary experience provided by the hotel restaurants and the wide variety of dining spaces on offer. 

The reality as an all inclusive guest was very limited, very confusing and with the exception of Sippi not very good.

To start with there are rules that seemingly change depending on who you talk to and when.

To be very clear as an all inclusive guest. Breakfast is served in the restaurant as is lunch (although you can take it at the pool bar or sippi after 2,30 - not before). Dinner is average and very repetitive buffet and served…yep you guessed it in the restaurant.  Unless you want to eat in SIPPI where you may get a 30% discount. We hate eating in the same place every night and made the choice based on the descriptions from TUI and Barcelo, which are simply not correct. It took a major escalation to get a deviation away from this for lunch and really left a sour taste in our mouths. No pun intended. I will also mention the hotel executive who intervened as my wife, by now was distraught. I was ready for book another hotel!

There is no roof top bar which is also comedically advertised.

The interior of property itself is tatty, paint peeling off walls and I appreciate it’s difficult with the humidity but this is meant to be…a 5 star resort.  The rooms are ok although we did have to move half way through our stay as we had a termite infestation, which resulted in termite poop all over the coffee area that wouldn’t be able to be fixed in the short term. Although curiously our former room was occupied the following day.

One thing also to consider is the hotel run promotions for locals which means at the weekend it can get very busy. To the point of being advised to get to breakfast before 7.30 to get a table. The same on a night when they ran out of tables. I understand the need to get paying guests in but when you can’t move and the hotel can’t get enough food out, it’s just not what you want for that exclusive Barcelo culinary experience.

The oddity of all this is that we would probably return, purely because of the staff who made us feel so welcome and 100% not via TUI who were beyond useless and have a feel that of the £9k we paid them, not a vast amount ended up with the hotel.

Final point, and this seems to be more an more common. Reviews, we were asked to make one within 24h of arriving stating staff members names as the Hotel is in competition with another. I really don’t like this and when I look further into the reviews many only have one, so question the authenticity plus consider how many management responses are made to those that are less than positive.","A truly honest review of the Eden Occidental - read before you book!","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r964040178-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

We are sorry that some aspects of your stay did not meet your expectations. While we are glad you found our grounds well-maintained, we regret to hear about your concerns regarding room allocation.

Additionally, we understand that the culinary experience did not live up to your expectations on this occasion, and we are reviewing your comments regarding the food with our culinary team to ensure that all dishes served meet our quality standards.

Nonetheless, we are pleased that you appreciated the attentive service from our staff. Our team is dedicated to providing exceptional service and we are glad this was evident during your stay.

They obviously take great care with the plants, the floors are polished multiple times a week. There are no stray dogs or annoying crows or aggressive squirrels to ruin your time at the pool/beach. But that also about where the justification for the high price ends. 

The rooms are small. We had booked a triple for two adults and a child and they first tried to pass off a double room. They fixed the mistake when we complained but at this price, it just should not have happened. 

The bathroom is mostly clean, but goodness, the fixtures are totally disgusting. We even tipped the cleaners extra to clean the fixtures properly and they did not. 

The food is ok - if you don’t count the day they served raw chicken skewers off the grill. The buffets are extremely repetitive , last nights dinner rolls are served for breakfast the next morning so…. 🤷🏼‍♂️

It was not worth the price we paid and I don’t think I would go again.

Nous n'avons pas trouvé les services habituellement proposés pour une telle réservation ce qui explique la note générale et celle concernant le rapport qualité / prix
L'emplacement semble idéal face à l'océan, c'est une belle carte postale mais en fonction de la marée, on se baigne dans l'eau de la mangrove (eau douce et marron). Après avoir visité la mangrove, on se rend compte que c'est une poubelle ! Il y a des courants se qui limite la baignade
L'hôtel est propre, le personnel est accueillant mais pas francophone. C'est donc parfait pour un hôtel étape ou partenaire
Pour nous la literie était inconfortable et la vue pas terrible (usine de traitement de l'eau)
La nourriture est très épicée même lorsque c'est indiqué le contraire. C'est difficile de se rabattre sur le snack car il n'est pas ouvert. Après quelques jours, nous avons compris qu'il fallait négocier avec le bar pour commander car les plats sont préparés au restaurant.
Concernant l'animation, inexistante la première semaine car le personnel était malade ou absent. Le soir, une ambiance musicale au bar. Avant notre départ, nous avons assisté au spectacle des animateurs (limite malaisant et d'une durée de 30mn)
Nos vacances n'ont pas été gâchées pour autant car à l'occasion de plusieurs excursions nous avons rencontrés des personnes touchantes et visités un magnifique pays. A aucun moment, nous avons eu le sentiment de tomber dans un attrape touriste. D'ailleurs la plus pas du temps, il y avant autant de locaux que d'étranger dans les endroits visités.

vielen Dank, dass Sie sich für einen Aufenthalt im Occidental Eden Beruwala, A Member Of Barcelo Hotel Group entschieden haben und für Ihre ehrliche Bewertung.

Es tut uns leid zu hören, dass Ihr Zimmer mit Meerblick nicht Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat und die Sicht auf das Meer nicht so klar war, wie erhofft. Bezüglich der Preise für unseren Wein möchten wir klarstellen, dass es Unterschiede zwischen Haus- und importierten Weinen gibt, jedoch sollten diese klar kommuniziert werden. Wir werden dies intern noch einmal ansprechen, um Missverständnisse in Zukunft zu vermeiden.
Wir freuen uns jedoch, dass Sie den Strand und das Meer genießen konnten und die Qualität des Indischen Ozeans loben. Auch Ihr Hinweis auf die leckeren Speisen in den Strandbars und Ihre Empfehlung des Maharja ist für uns und andere Gäste sehr wertvoll.

Wir hoffen, Sie beim nächsten Mal gänzlich von uns überzeugen zu dürfen.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen,

The Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kaluwamodara, Beruwala 12070 Sri Lanka","Beruwala","Sri Lanka","12070",,"Kaluwamodara",,"496617","6.444424","Beruwala, Western Province","79.98913","Occidental Eden Beruwala","3216","4.5","72","100","231","652","2163","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1189172-d496617-Reviews-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html","http://www.barcelo.com/en-ae/occidental-eden-beruwala/","2024-03-14","OTHER","3",,"Value","3","Location","4","Service","3",,,,,,,"Nach Ende einer Rundreise haben wir dort noch 5 Tage Badeurlaub verbracht.
Die Empfangshalle ist pompös, das Zimmer mit ""Meerblick"" war es leider nicht.
Relativ klein und das Meer musste man erahnen. Die Liegen unter den Schirmen waren bereits in der früh reserviert. Der Strand und das Meer haben dies allerdings wieder wettgemacht. Indischer Ozean vom Feinsten.
Das Essen ist Durchschnitt und Vorsicht beim Wein. Hab für Glas Rotwein unterschiedliche Preise bezahlt. Angeblich gibt es Haus- und importierten Wein.
Wurde aber bei der Bestellung nie gefragt. Ist einfach nicht fair.
Mein Fazit: Das Hotel ist ok, aber bucht nur Frühstück. Leckeres und viel billigeres Essen gibt es an den Bars am Strand.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your recent stay with us in CPB. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our selection of Sri Lankan cuisine, the spacious pool area, the well-maintained grounds, and the helpfulness of our staff. It's also great to know that you found your room to be a good size and the air conditioning quiet.
We appreciate your positive comments regarding the manager's assistance with the Coke Zero. We also understand your disappointment with the inclusions in our All-Inclusive package, particularly the exclusion of wine and bottled soft drinks.
We continuously review our offerings to ensure they meet the expectations of our guests while also allowing us to provide value. We note your feedback regarding the wine and will certainly take this into consideration as we evaluate our All-Inclusive options moving forward. We aim to be transparent about what is included in our packages, and we are sorry if this aspect of your stay was not entirely satisfactory.
Thank you again for your valuable feedback. We hope that the positive aspects of your stay will bring you back to visit us again in the future.

Thank you for your detailed review. We're delighted you found our hotel nice and quiet, enjoyed the beautiful vegetation, and appreciated the well-maintained grounds and pool. We're also glad you enjoyed the typical, albeit spicy, dishes and found the entertainment perfect.
We sincerely apologize for the shortcomings you experienced in our restaurant and bar service. We understand your frustration with the lack of table service due to the absence of carafes and the infrequent server availability. We will address this issue with our restaurant staff and management to ensure improvements are made. Similarly, we acknowledge the long wait times at the main bar due to the limited number of servers and will take steps to improve staffing and efficiency.
We are also very concerned to hear about the lack of pool loungers and umbrellas, and the alleged need for bribes to secure them. This is unacceptable, and we will investigate this matter thoroughly and take immediate action to prevent such occurrences in the future. We aim to provide a comfortable and equitable experience for all our guests.
We are, however, very pleased to hear that Lulu, Léa, Popo, Remy, and Ambre contributed to your well-being with their good humor. We will pass along your appreciation to them.
We value your feedback and will use it to improve our services and ensure a more enjoyable experience for all our guests. We hope you will consider giving us another opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to providing 1 excellent service.   
Sincerely 
Asanka Niroshan

Отель выбирали по отзывам и близости к аэропорту , так как ехали с детьми . Зайдя на ресепшен , увидев их стол , поняли , что 😂 «немного» приехали не туда 😂 
Были очень удивлены, что мало кто пишет о том, что номера просто ужасные ! Пол красит ноги . Доп кровати только за доплату и в принципе не понимают зачем нам доп кровать для ребенка и почему они не могут спать на одной 😂( возраст детей 8 лет и 10 ) , а кровать односпальная . Матрасы ужас ( такое ощущение, что на местом рынке на них сидели , а потом в отель приволокли₽! 
В 1 день добились , чтоб нам постелили 2х спальный матрас , а не 2 односпальных , но удивлению не было предела , когда на следующий день этот матрас исчез ! И ни хрена его не вернули (представитель от Анекса пытался-пытался этот вопрос порешать)  , но смог предложить только за 4 дня( а отдыхали мы 13 ночей) до выезда переселение в другой номер! И слава богу , что мы отказались 😂😂😂, так номер с выходом на канализацию, через пальмы 🌴 и деревья . 

Еда - макароны, рис (рис в рисе , рисом завернут 😂) , овощи (капуста, огурцы, помидоры). Фруктов толком нет (арбуз режут на квадратике , чтоб по-больше на тарелке было ) . Все острят так , что караул ! 

«все включено» - сразу говорю не такое как в Турции и Египте . Здесь завтрак/обед/ужин 
Заявление перекусы -это хлеб с маслом 😂, пирог и иногда могут кусочки рыбы в кляре дать - и всееее 🤷‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Алкоголь до 23:30 и с 23:00 следять , как церберы , чтоб больше 2х бокалов в одни руки не давали .
На пляже лежаков 20 - все всегда заняты полотенцами.
На бассейне лежаков хватает , только , когда массовый выезд людей из отеля .

Прохладительные напитки 😂 - фанта/кола/вода (фото стола с этими напитками приложу).

Анимация -нулевая . 2 раза за день подойдут к микрофону , чет скажут и пропали .

Бассейн по длине норм , но он требует реставрации .

Уборка каждый день . Но только в номере 😂 балкон они номером не считают , но это мелочи .шампуни /гели сами не кладут (ну у нас так было) приходилось искать уборщика и просить . Потом плюнули и купили в магазине себе шампунь и гель .
Фен допотопный, хорошо , что взяли свой . 

За территорией все глухо . 4 ресторанчика поблизости , но готовят там хорошо . Рынок местный на тук-туке 5-10 минут . 

Единственный плюс -это территория. Большая , зеленая, ухоженная и восхитительная. Но живности кроме собак, котов и ворон нет 😂

Вернемся ли мы в этот отель ? Однозначно нет !","«Капля дёгтя -в бочку с медом»","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r985332345-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

Much would have to change in it to be considered a four-star hotel. A few examples of the terrible service we encountered:
- we arrived in the morning at around 6:00 and it turned out that our hotel day starts at 14:00 and that supposedly there were no rooms available at the moment... Half an hour later, a proposal suddenly appeared that if we pay 40 USD, a room would be found for those few hours... Embarrassing. An hour later we saw that there were many rooms available.
- we were also informed that we had to pay 26 USD for breakfast, despite the fact that we came for 14 days with all inclusive. Complete lack of respect for the customer and understanding of the principles of operation of good hotels in the world. I talked about it with one of the management people (I told him that I would describe everything on portals) - he only mumbled that these were their ""procedures"".
- it was similar when we left - we were allowed to stay in the room until 1:00 p.m., but we couldn't eat dinner at 12:30! We were told that we had to pay extra for dinner 29 USD. At 12:10 a member of staff approached us specifically to cut off our all-inclusive band!! In none of the good hotels I've been have I encountered such treatment of a customer! - after waiting we got a nicely located room, where the hot and cold water could not be adjusted in the shower and after a minute of showering it became water because the drain was clogged, the repairman came twice before he fixed it,
- the room was usually cleaned around 4 or 5 pm, which was irritating,
- there are no animations in the hotel, at our request they once organized water gymnastics and it was the only activity of the ""animators"" for the guests for 14 days,
- the bar by the pools did not work at all, we had to walk 100 meters to the bar in the main building for drinks,
- in the canteen during meals dirty dishes are cleaned of leftovers at one of the posts almost in the middle of the room in front of everyone, which is totally absurd,
- the safes in the rooms are not attached to the wall, so you can safely take them out of the room,
- dogs that do not have collars indicating vaccination against rabies are constantly wandering around the hotel, they go under the sunbeds,
- the beach is very small and has a big drop with big waves,
- the hotel is already worn out, for a 4 star it would have to undergo many renovations.

The advantage of the hotel is definitely the people from the service, who are helpful and smiling, but with the idiotic ""procedures"" introduced by the management of this hotel, unfortunately it does not change the low opinion of this hotel.","Poor hotel in nice location","2024-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r963612756-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

As with most resorts, they have about 30 sun loungers and 200+ guests. Despite signage everywhere starting sun loungers cannot be reserved, you will not get one unless you wake up early and place your items on it. The food is average, a selection of western and sri lankan items, the quality of the meat is poor. The alcoholic drinks included in the package are low quality but will suffice. Staff are friendly if you get their attention and ask them to do something, you’ll die of old age before you are offered a drink with your meal. I wasn’t able to book any massage / spa services during my 5 day visit due to no availability. It seems you are treated much better at this resort if you are booked as part of a tour group, reserved tables, activities and treatments are all given to them as a priority. There isn’t much nearby the resort and as soon as you step outside the very small private beach, you will find it very dirty.

Прежде чем покупать , прочитала массу положительных отзывов. Постараюсь быть объективной при написании отзыва. Отель уставший, но чистенький, сказать, что это четверка, нуу, наверное если кубинская и египетская, то да, если эмираты то 3 точно)  если не обращать внимание на огромных крыс которые бегают на ресепшене по стенам ) и жителей которые живут в номерах. 
Номер который нам достался, был крайне уставшим, жутко гудел электрический щиток, лейка в душе не работала должным образом, открутили и мылись под струёй воды) убирались каждый день, мыло и шампунь мы видели только в первый день) потом видимо персонал видя, что есть своё не посчитал нужным положить) 
Постельное белье, чистое, но очень застиранное( холодильник при открытии так паханул, что дочь сказала, кто там повесился)) Сейф работал, выдали по просьбе адаптер для зарядок. 
Басеин, достаточно большой и чистый, в час пик с лежаками и полотенцами беда) 
По ресторану, нууу.....тут отдельный разговор, сказать, что мы были голодны нет, но 90% еды очень сильно перченая либо с огромным количеством специй. разнообразие не великое, но в общем норм, не вау, но и не совсем ужасно.
Теперь про океан, берег крупный песок, об который можно с легкостью ободрать колени очень сильные волны почти всегда , к океану идем через территорию отеля и дорогу. возле океана вообще ограниченное количество лежаков. С утра бегом туда) на берегу продают коктейли безалкогольные, можно купить тарелку с нарезанными фруктами, и вам предложат экскурсии) скажу сразу, информацию о местах куда вы поедите лучше прочитать самим, никто вам ничего не расскажет, говорят по русски очень плохо. 
Торгуйтесь везде кроме супермаркетов, если что-то хотите купить просто посмотрите на карте где больше ТЦ и туда, там гарантированно будет дешевле, чем вам впарят по пути) все же понимают, они работают на проценте )) 
Магазин на территории отеля и за его пределами у Саши, безумно дорогой, но это опять таки ожидаемо , это бизнес, ничего личного )","Коротко о главном)","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r933774983-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

The bar area was nice. We were on half board so paid for drinks which were 5 star hotel prices. Only one man made good strong cocktails,  so we didn't want to taste only juice so stopped drinking them. The pool very clean and nice to swim in but a less fit person might find it difficult getting in and out due to the layout. The hotel grounds and gardens well kept. We had relaxing stay here but I must mention the hotel needs improving. Our mattresses were very hard and lumpy and badly stained. Only an old plastic table and chairs to sit on on veranda, it needs sunbed and comfortable chairs. NO ROOM SERVICE MENU which we would have ordered lunch so now hotel has lost a way to make money, and phone we could not hear person speaking at other end. Very good laundry service and the room always cleaned to a high standard. Handle on  sliding door broke twice but immediately fixed. And socket not working also immediately fixed. Very stupid that there is only 1 room key because as soon as you need it to go out, the electric goes off so everything in fridge goes hot! Activities seem to be very limited except when groups of local people stay. I was told aqua aerobics on and only me got in pool so man disappeared which was rude! The hotel is excellent at managing a lot of people and groups without impacting on service well done for this.

My experience at Club Palm Bay Hotel had its ups and downs, but overall, it was a mixed bag. I will start with the negatives before moving on to the improvements.

On the first day of my stay, I encountered several issues that left me disappointed. The dinner buffet was a major letdown as there was a shortage of food options. It was disheartening to see empty trays and limited choices, which definitely impacted the overall dining experience. Furthermore, I found the room service to be extremely slow. It took over two hours for my order to finally reach my room, which was frustrating and inconvenient. The delay in delivering the food tarnished my perception of the hotel's efficiency and customer service.

Another major drawback was the loud club music playing at the main restaurant. The ambiance was completely inappropriate for a dining setting. It was challenging to hold a conversation due to the overpowering noise, and it detracted from the overall dining experience. This aspect was definitely a letdown, as I expected a more serene and relaxed environment to enjoy my meal.

However, I must say that the hotel management took note of these issues and made improvements the next day. During breakfast and lunch, I was pleasantly surprised to find a better spread of food options. The variety and quality of the dishes were significantly improved, which made the dining experience much more enjoyable. It was reassuring to see that the hotel took the feedback seriously and made an effort to rectify the initial shortcomings.

In summary, my first day at Club Palm Bay Hotel was marred by a shortage of food at the dinner buffet, slow room service, and inappropriate loud club music at the main restaurant. However, the hotel management showed their commitment to customer satisfaction by addressing these issues promptly. The following day, the lunch buffet had a better spread, indicating that the hotel took the necessary steps to improve the dining experience. While my initial experience was disappointing, the hotel's responsiveness and efforts to rectify the situation left me with a more positive impression overall.","A mixed bag","2023-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r899972344-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

The facilitates are lovely and the sunset pool was great for us as a couple, however as this is the adult pool maybe more policing is needed. The room was nice however we did have a small critter problem with a large insect found in the bed and quite a few insects around the room. 

We were staying over the Sri Lankan New Year which the hotel had on events for, this led to the hotel being very busy and might have caused some of the problems we faced such as a lack of service (waiting a very long time for drinks and meals, along with the problems from housekeeping). We booked day trips through the hotel which were good however overpriced and the day tours were just drivers and whilst friendly enough were not particularly knowledgeable about where we were going and maybe a lack of communication between the hotel and drivers along with rather over-enthusiastic descriptions of the trips. 

The hotel recommended a city tour of Hambantota which consisted of the botanical gardens and bird zoo which we were unaware of, we had to pay 4,500 as foreigners for the bird zoo, which turned out to be birds in small cages - we did not enjoy this. The driver then told us the botanical gardens had a long wait time and he didn’t recommend it, so we paid $60 to be driven to two locations only 15 minutes away, one of which was very disappointing. 

The food was average, as a vegetarian there was a lack of options to choose from at some of the restaurants, however a good dinner buffet selection. The Sera is quite overpriced especially considering the quality of food we received. 

The grounds are beautifully maintained and the safaris are worthwhile as there is fantastic nature. I would recommend as a short stay for the safaris.","Good for a short stay","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1015317684-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

We booked a suite category room with an ocean view and the disappointment began there...the ocean from our room was barely visible...and upon frequent calls n discussions they gave another room just above the room provided...now what we can see is a trace of ocean n that too at a distance...
Also it was located at a noisy place near the pool, we wanted a peaceful place to reside in...so we had to adjust in the room which 
1. Does not offer an ocean view 
2 located at a noisy place...
The image updated on the website, does not match the room we checked in...

As it was a vacation, we let it go as we didn't want to spoil our mood. 
We are vegetarians and mentioned that at the time of booking and check in. If a 5 star property is accepting bookings for vegetarians then they should make proper arrangements for the Indian vegetarian guests... unfortunately their Indian chef was on leave and we could not find anything on the menu that can be eaten by us, except a cheese pizza..
One night for dinner we had that barely as we are not pizza lovers, second night we again got a pizza but it came 45 min post giving na order n that too very cold as if someone forgot to serve it...
 The food was the biggest challenge in the hotel, it is at a remote location so a tuk tuk or a cab does not come easily. The hotel charges hefty if we book a car through them. Hospitality and service is 0 especially at restaurants. 
What one expects from a hotel, a classy room with a great view, good food and hospitality, especially when you book a higher category rooms, which charges 30k-35k INR per night.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay at Shangri-La Hambantota. We are truly pleased to hear that you enjoyed our beautiful property, beach access, and the culinary experience — especially the personalized attention provided by Chef Dharmendra Shah. Your kind words will certainly be shared with him and the culinary team; he’ll be delighted to know he made a positive impact on your stay.

That said, we are sincerely sorry for the inconveniences you experienced with housekeeping and the air conditioning in your room. It is disappointing to hear that these issues affected your comfort, and we fully understand how unsettling that must have been.

We are pleased to note that our Rooms Division Manager had the opportunity to speak with you personally at the time of your departure regarding these concerns. Following your report, our engineering team did attend to the air conditioning, and we hope it was brought back to a satisfactory level during your stay.

With regard to the pest issue, please accept our sincerest apologies. While regular pest control is indeed carried out across the resort, it is likely that recent fumigation activities in nearby room blocks may have caused cockroaches to appear temporarily in your room. We understand how distressing this must have been. Our housekeeping team has since conducted a thorough deep cleaning of the room in your presence, and we have taken immediate corrective action to prevent any recurrence.

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, and we assure you that maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness, comfort, and guest satisfaction remains our top priority.

We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future, and provide a seamless experience that reflects the true standards of Shangri-La hospitality.

Further to the telephone discussion you had with our Assistant Front Office Manager, we would like to clarify that an early check-in request was received through our system (Okay), which automatically applied an additional charge to your bill.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding regarding the system-generated request.

Upon checkin we were given an invoice which had a rate of more than 20k to that which was agreed (135k vs agreed 115k). Upon enquiry of the rate we had to at first show our email with agreed rate and booking confirmation.

After back and fro we were advised that the extra cost was for early checkin (35 minutes before check in time of 2pm). As goodwill the hotel was happy to waive the extra charge for 35 mins early checkin.

Concerns regarding above;
1. If we were going to be charged extra then the  hotel should have advised us instead of quietly getting us to sign the booking sheet with extra cost.

2. 20% extra cost for 35 mins can be considered excessive when early checkin was not requested.

If the above was a mistake in the booking process we would have been more understanding.

The hotel generally was good. Room 247 has timber flooring that is warped and hence pinch the sole of your feet.

The tambili at breakfast was empty and not filled despite quite a few requests. The hopper ladies were great. 

The life guards and in particular those at the beach were great.

Pools were great.

It just isn’t up to Shangri La standards in terms of food and service. Th main restaurant resembles a canteen (although the live music is  a real bonus). Tables aren’t properly wiped and every meal something was missing cutlery wise.

Having a wine list only works if you have the wine’s - one evening we had to go through four to find one in stock, we should have given up as each request took at least 10 mins before being told that it wasn’t available.

The coffee is dreadful and oddly there is only orange juice on request; again this took at least 15 minutes to arrive.

Comprehension of English from staff seems poor, despite the high number of  English speaking tourists. Orders have to repeated multiple times, but still delivered with errors e.g. order a Margherita pizza which came with Pepperoni on. Ask for no cheese in Burger, arrives with cheese. Ask for a fork, takes three attempts to deliver this. Try to place a booking for one of the activities is a convoluted and confusing task. Reception tells you to go to one area, who have no idea it is supposed to take place, who direct you somewhere else to only find out it’s unavailable (example is the Henna tattoo service which is advertised throughout the resort). However, the opposite is true of the Cleaning service and Kids Club, which is EXCELLENT. However, since the resort is isolated from any major attractions or towns, it is a destination in itself.

Restaurant: es gibt á la-Card Restaurants und 1 Buffet Restaurant, welches wir am ersten Abend besucht haben, da es hieß es wäre in unserer Buchung dabei - war es nicht. Das Essen war am Buffet abwechslungsreich und für jeden etwas dabei uns wurden dann 130€ für 2 Personen für das Buffet (ohne Getränke) berechnet, 2 Cappuccinos am Pool kosten 11€, auch das Restaurant am Golfclub ist nicht gerade billig, Steak kostet 45-60€, über das Preisniveau kann man sicher diskutieren.

Golfplatz: Sehr schöner Golfplatz, anspruchsvolle Löcher, gepflegt, aber für das Greenfee erwartet man sich ein besseres Niveau - als Hotelanlage durchschnittlich.
Caddys sind sehr freundlich, Carts allerdings in einem erbärmlichen Zustand, Sitze und Feststellbremse kaputt und ziemlich in die Jahre gekommen. Ein weiterer Nachteil ist, dass man nach den ersten 9 nicht direkt am Cubhouse vorbeikommt, es aber auch keine Half-Way-Station gibt, bei der man Getränke oder einen kleinen Snack kaufen kann, was bei der Hitze schon Sinn macht. Ein Golfplatz auf dem Niveau sollte auch einen Bar-Wagen haben, der am Platz rumfährt und Getränke verkauft - auch dies Fehlanzeige - auf dem vom Hotel versprochenen Niveau eigentlich ein Unding.

PS: Sylvester Gala Dinner kostete 250€ pro Person, alle anderer Restaurants im Hotel hatten geschlossen, so wenn man im Hotel bleiben wollte, war man gezwungen das ""Angebot"" anzunehmen..
Das Dinner war in Ordnung, Essen etwas schöner angeboten, als im normalen Buffet, aber den preis nicht wirklich Wert..

What didn’t go so well
- The front desk are poorly trained
- Check in was prolonged and messy due to the front desk’s incompetence - they kept getting different bookings confused. They also didn’t want our passports then asked for them later 
- Guests in adjacent rooms were smoking cannabis and the smell came into our balcony and rooms. The front desk did not take this seriously at all and the duty manager Sunil (who didn’t know I can understand Sinhalese) initially smirked when a member of staff told him. We also received an inappropriate response when we complained on WhatsApp - “That's great to hear. Have a good day ahead.
-Service Center”. Sunil later appeared to try and help but stated there were no rooms with king beds we could move into. I find this hard to believe when the resort is so huge. 
- The front desk are unable to handle simple queries. Even with small queries, they walk around like confused and constipated ducks, talking to at least 6 colleagues before replying to you. 
- My son cut his food on the tiles in the kids pool - the staff showed no concern

Have wanted to stay here since it was built but sadly wouldn’t return or recommend. 

Rooms (delux garden) comfortable enough but view of the near by factory was not great (hotel was quite empty according to staff so we were surprised we were not 1) upgraded to a better view room or 2) offered to pay to upgrade the room. 

I think that the issue is the language barrier. The staff have a very limited knowledge of English which can be frustrating when requesting something simple - operator simply hung up on me 4x as she didn’t understand my request… (asking if my telephone was blocked to make outside calls) … 
That said, the staff are ALL absolutely charming and couldn’t be more helpful …they are a credit to the hotel but some language training would be a benefit to non Sri Lankan visitors. 
The hotel is pretty shabby sadly (maybe due to us being out of season) with building work making access to restaurants from pool impossible without  to go back to reception. 
I feel bad writing such a negative review but do feel that, for the prices being charged - and the use of a “luxury brand” name, improvements need to be made. 
If youre looking for a luxury stay, I’d recommend the Fortress - approximately 1 hour down the coast.

It's about 10 years old and needs a good update. They were doing some renovations while we were in the wing we were staying in! They have 4 wings why not shutdown a whole wing and renovate that and move on to the next one rather then have guest walk through sanding dust all day! Common sense really.

Whe we got to the pools there are generally in good condition. However the san beds were disgusting! Completely covered in black mould!!! At a 5 start star resort this is totally unacceptable. I raised this with customer service and was giving your standard answer of oh sorry for the inconvenience I ask to speak to the manager and they sent a duty manager who also apologies. I said does your generally manager not care enough about the hotel that he doesn't do regular walk around the hotel at least 1 ever 6 month to check on the status of his hotel? If he had he would have picked up on that many other issues too.

I will say the next day they immediately started replacing them. So they knew but didn't care until our group complained!

Food prices for kids is ridiculously expense of what they got. Kids burger is the size of a large boiled eggs and cost us $10!

More than 5 nights feeels like a long time....","Value","2","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","2","Service","2","Sleep Quality","5","So, how do you describe this resort? It is good, but it is neither a resort nor a hotel and suffering from an identity crisis. The Shangri La are typically city hotels with polished service and support that know people are busy and are there for a short period. This resort is very relaxed but has the undercurrents of business hotel that do not work together well. As resorts typically are very welcoming, they know they need to make your life as easy as possible, with the small touches making a big difference over longer periods. This resort feels like they know turnover is quick and that by the time the client is looking for the finer details they are gone….   This hotel has none of that warmth that you get through other 5-star resorts, but it's not a bad resort; it just does not know what it is. This hotel feels more like a corporate events hotel than a holiday location. The pool is great for little ones up to about 10, and the pools are shallow at 1.2 meters which is a bit shallow for me (even the adult pool). The beach is very dirty, with a lot of plastic waste which a resort should always be collecting as it’s the frontage. Also it did not feel that safe with a lot of stray dogs and I was worried about cleanliness, the water in August is extremely rough with very big waves so this is a beach facing hotel only, the beach is not usable or even very walkable. They take safety very seriously with life guards all the time and the staff are very friendly. It was a little odd that even after two weeks they were asking how long we were staying and treated us like a new customer each day, which for a resort is strange, you would expect that they would know who you are at this point. Some staff did but as per the warmth comment earlier it did not feel like anyone really knew who were and that we liked tea in the evening which was questioned every night as an extra and not included. In one case they even refused to serve it, which was odd considering it’s a 5 star and its tea and Sri Lanka where tea is from. The food was good, but cooperate events hotel good, and very Sri Lankan not international resort good, the food was a on the weaker side compared with other 5 star resorts I have stayed in.  A major complaint is they did not change the table cloths so you sit down for breakfast or dinner and they would already be stained with ‘fresh” stains of chocolate or food form the morning, so I found myself choosing a location by where and which was clean. The activities were also a bit badly organised and English was bit of an issue in general, and getting information was hard (in the resort on a whole), considering this is a base for the national parks it needs to be easier and we paid two different prices and strategies which was also odd. One where we hired their car and paid the driver of the jeep ourselves and one where they arranged all, with a big differences in price, honestly I don’t know why they just did not make this easier and we only learnt about the former after a few trips as it was not offered. You also need to keep going to reception to pay off your balance as they take a deposit and when that runs out you have to pay it off and start again, this over 2 weeks was annoying, and for a resort strange. The kids club is very good and they enjoyed it, it does close for 1 hr per day so its not a club you could leave the kids all day if you wanted to, not that we would. We also did the bike trip which was strange experience and not recommended, the bikes were not in good working order, to say the least an in an extreme state of degradation, I did not even know bikes could work in those conditions. The 15mk route was alos a little strange and not what we expected, thy also could have provided water or something, not that I needed it for 15kmn as we are very fit cyclists but…. Its 35 oC and if someone needed water /food what would they do, again it felt like we had booked this and they did not know what to do but felt obligated. No stops, no views, no real agenda to the cycle just a circular route on the streets. As you pay 7000rps  per person you would expect something, or a cycle to a location if interest? 

In short, the hotel feels like its recovering and the outside areas are subject to the battering of the weather and in need of repairs. The rooms were very clean and good condition, and in a new state. 

Finally we would like to thank Rashmi in club hours, and Nishan and Chathurya in the main restaurant. 

Depsite this reading quite negative we had a lovely two weeks and the hotel was a great base for the national parks, but I would advise using it as such and not staying longer than 4 days and using it as a hotel more than a resort.

Thank you for choosing Shangri la Hambantota for your first visit to Sri Lanka, and for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. We are delighted to hear that your overall experience was positive, and that you enjoyed the spacious rooms, the beautiful pools, and your excursion to Yala.

We’re especially glad to know that the greeting you received upon arrival was fantastic, and that Sathdani was able to make your stay more enjoyable. I will be sure to pass on your kind words to her.

We appreciate your comments about the areas where we can improve. I apologize for the inconvenience you faced with the towels in your room and the condition of the sunbeds by the pool. We will address these issues immediately to ensure that our facilities meet the highest standards of comfort and cleanliness.

I also regret that you found the buffet food repetitive and that there were instances where certain dishes and drinks were unavailable. We are always looking to enhance our dining options, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us do so.

Your experience at the spa and the positive comments about Sera restaurant are greatly appreciated, and we are glad you enjoyed them. However, I’m sorry that there was only one therapist available during your visit. We will look into improving this to better serve our guests.

Lastly, we’re glad you enjoyed the music and DJ events, and that you had a good experience with the trip to Yala organized through the hotel.

Once again, thank you for your feedback. We hope to welcome you back to [Hotel Name] in the future, where we will strive to provide an even better experience.
Till we meet again please take care.

The transfer from Columbo airport is around 3 hours, which makes a difference to the travel time. 
The greeting at the hotel was fantastic. Especially Sathdani, who was helpful throughout our visit.

The rooms were big and nice. We were short of towels and several days had to ask for extra. 

The pools are really nice. The sunbeds would be nice, but the seating is left out when it rains and were really mouldy. Several also had rips in them. This really needs upgrading. The pool bar  is ok. 

Service overall was generally really friendly, but could be very slow in all areas. 

The buffet food became a bit repetitive. There is a wide range of food available. Sera restaurant was nice. One issue we experienced frequently was dishes and drinks being unavailable, such as apple or orange juice.

We went on a trip to Yala organised through the hotel which was really good.

The beach has huge waves and not swimable in August.

The spa was good value but only one therapist was available.

The hotel was quiet during the week, a lot busier at weekends. There is music and a DJ on some days.","Nice hotel.

Firstly we were staying with a 6 & 4 year old. They loved the pool but adored the kids club, Dineshika & Sureshani were excellent with the children. 5 stars on the above. 

The overall review score is a more general reflection on the hotel. 
The hotel is quite tiered and in need to modernising. The most frustrating though was the waiting staff who were very hit or miss. On one occasion it took 35 minutes to get a bottle of water, and we were sitting in the bar. In the end I told them I’d get it myself and they jumped into action. 

Also they fumigate the hotel twice a week, which is great for mosquitos but meant that on one of the days we were staying there were thousands of black insects, ladybird size all over the corridors that kept coming into our room.","Great for young kids, no so great for adults","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r964576639-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for this warm and beautiful recap of your stay with us at Shangri La Hambantota.  our team always strives to offer personalized experiences that represent the Shangri La Hambantota spirit and aim to leave a lasting memorable impression; we are delighted to know that they succeeded in doing so.

Since it the weather conditions at the time of your visit was very hot during the whole day, we had challenges in the swimming pool water condition. To rectify the issue we had huge ice cubes inserted to balancing tank to get the water cooled.  We are extremely sorry if any inconvenience caused during your stay.  In Hambantota, the beach is not recommended for swimming after March as the sea gets very rough with heavy waves. The best period to swim would be between November to end of March.

The restaurant manager was really friendly and welcoming. The bar staff and Pro shop staff was also very friendly. The second room  we received was lovely. This was after the first room was close to children’s play area and it had a musty smell. Room service and cleaning staff was really friendly and very professional. 
If you want a quite room ask for it to be located near the adult pool. 
However, I would not recommend this resort if you are going with friends. And we are not party animals. Just looking to relax. (Ages of friends between (37- 45.)
Mostly caters for families and couples. 
The traditional dancers were not at the resort as advertised on various bookings platforms. This was a reason for booking this stay. Please enquire before hand if this is what you expect. The photos on the various platforms do not look like the property itself. We took the half board option and without it we would have spent a fortune. The ++ on the menus is service and tax charges and it can get expensive. The pools are not cooled, so in the dry season when it is really hot the pools are not very refreshing. There isn’t really a sea view from the rooms. The hotel is situated away from the beach and palm trees are between the hotel and beach. The closest we got to a view, was getting a room closer to the adult pool section. 
And finally, this is NOT a swimming beach. Currents are too strong and it gets deep very quickly. It was a bitter sweet stay. And we were a little disappointed as we booked three days and wanted to relax after a busy couple of days exploring the Kandy area. We will unfortunately not be back.","Bitter Sweet Stay","2024-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r951325634-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

These are great for relaxing in. The golf course is a bonus if you like to play and the staff are very friendly and warm. The rooms are  very nice and very clean. For a family holiday this is the perfect hotel although there isn’t much to do outside the resort itself.  Trips to local safari’s, tea plantations and a turtle sanctuary as well as Galle can all be arranged through the hotel and these are highly recommended. The beach enjoys stunning views with crashing waves and beautiful sand, and is great to walk along when it’s not too hot.

Whilst all the staff go out of their way to make you feel very welcome, unfortunately, the service was extremely slow and it was not unusual to wait for long periods to be served food and drinks at the bar next to the golf club  or next to the  poolside.  For all the efforts the staff go to in the main restaurant, the quality of food at the buffet is poor and lacks choice for a five star hotel. Every night, the food was pretty much the same, which became boring. The hotel also lacks atmosphere, most notably in the evenings. Bring a good book to keep yourself entertained after evening meals as there is nowhere in the hotel to go and indulge in some good, worthwhile entertainment. It would be a real unique attraction if there was a programme of entertainment for guests to enjoy each evening.

Sri Lanka is a beautiful place to visit with lots to do. We stayed for 7 nights at the hotel before continuing our adventures around the rest of the country. Three or four nights instead at the Shangri La Hambantota would be enough. Easy tweaks with food, service and entertainment would give much better value for money and would provide a much better all round guest experience.","Great hotel where small tweaks would make huge difference","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r945411318-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

We are delighted to hear that you had a memorable stay with us before heading to the tea plantations. Indeed, the climate here can be quite different from Kandy, so your advice about bringing something warm is very helpful for future guests.

The train ride to the hill country is truly an incredible journey, offering breathtaking views and a glimpse into the impressive engineering feats of the past. We are glad you enjoyed this unique experience and the charming ""little England"" atmosphere at the top.

Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. While we are delighted to hear that you enjoyed certain aspects of your stay, we regret any areas where we fell short of your expectations. We truly value your feedback and would like to address some of the points you raised:

Firstly, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the ongoing maintenance work on your floor. Please be assured that we strive to ensure minimal disruption to our guests during such activities.

It's important to note that due to the cool climate in the region, most hotels in Nuwara Eliya are not equipped with air conditioning. Instead, heaters are provided in the rooms to ensure guests' comfort during cooler weather.

We regret any discomfort you may have experienced due to the lack of cooling options in your room. However, we are pleased to inform you that we do offer stand fans as an alternative option for extra cooling upon request.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused during your stay. Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we strive to accommodate our guests' needs to the best of our ability.

Additionally, we regret any disappointment you may have experienced with the massage service. Our spa team is dedicated to providing a tranquil and rejuvenating experience for our guests, and we apologize if we fell short of this standard during your visit.

While we understand that no hotel is perfect, we are committed to continuously improving our services and facilities based on guest feedback. Your comments have been shared with the relevant teams for further review and action.

We appreciate your understanding and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a more enjoyable stay in the future.

I was told by staff. The smell was so strong it gave me a headache. Then we got into the room and although it was a pleasant cool in the hallway the room was stuffy and warm. We couldn’t open a window as they were locked and there was no aircon or fan! Only a heater. It was very difficult to sleep I’ve never experienced this before! There obviously are times of the year you need heating but there are also times when you need cooling!
The massage experience was very ordinary. I expected more from a spa in a hotel at 14,000 rs. The room was brightly lit, the music wasn’t soft. Not a serene and relaxing experience at all. Would’ve been better from the ladies in town!
I have to say all of the staff were very attentive and most helpful. One of the staff in the restaurant asked if we liked the dinner buffet. When we asked why there wasn’t more Sri Lankan food. He went to the kitchen and very kindly surprised us with a lovely chicken curry. 

It’s a pity the room experience has clouded our judgement.","Disappointing room","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d5999727-r939464556-Araliya_Green_Hills_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Our room wasn’t ready so they wanted to leave our luggage unattended in the foyer which didn’t sit well with us and we asked for it to be put somewhere safer. Our room was small with little space to move and an even smaller bathroom had no amenities (shampoo etc.) barely any hot water and one small bar of soap for 3 to share. The outside toilet had no toilet paper and hotel signage threatened charges for food and beverages brought in from external sources. The food offerings for breakfast were very average, basic western style dishes which were just warm and the Sri Lankan foods on offer were nearly empty by the time we got there and they were not replenished. There was a resupply of fresh fruit though which was nice.

The beds were nice and comfy. Today there was a breakfast buffet but a very small variety of food was there. There was some lettuce, tomato, cucumber,croissants, buns, thosa, chicken curry,pol sambol, omelettes, chicken sausages and guava and mixed fruit juice. For me, the food was quite disappointing. 

The sea in front of the hotel in parts was VERY rocky. We went to a nearby beach (a 3-minute walk) to snorkel. We really, really enjoyed that!

Lunch was served as a sit-down meal and so was dinner.

We went to the turtle beach nearby and the sea was a bit rough but there were lots of fish and there were reef sharks too. There was a new world underwater, there were baby sea snakes, lot of sea urchins and lots of other fish.

In all fairness, my friend had booked the premium room for about the same price and it was close to perfect. We were next door to each other. My room only had one plug for recharging devices. Bathroom shower didn't have anywhere to put soap and shampoo except the floor. The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner and bar soap. My room looked a bit shabby and could use a fresh coat of paint. Needs a coat of paint.  I  had to ask to have my room made up one day and so did my friend. The door to the balcony, overlooking the ocean, was difficult to open and close and the handle fell off a few times because I had to pull extremely hard to close the door. On a positive note, the staff were great..very friendly and helpful. Any time I called the desk the problem was solved immediately. Check in was wasy, the lobby and pool are beautiful with a view of the ocean.
 Good breakfast and good wifi. Great location on the beach. Snorkeling beaches are 5 minutes walk away. I know the better hotels on the beach are higher priced so perhaps this is a bargain for waterfront but not worth it for me.

The hotel is built on a narrow stretch of land between the busy Galle road and beautiful HIkkaduwa beach. Rooms were comfortable with a small but clean bathroom. Bed-linen and towels were clean and spotless. Sleep quality of the bed and pillows was excellent. However, the lay-out of the electrical sockets in the room was ridiculous: with electrical socket in the bathroom dangerously close (within the splashing distance) to the wash basin, and the one for the electrical kettle, right under the table (as expected the wire of the kettle was too short, so that unless you creep under the table, you cant plug the kettle!). There is no mini bar in the room but there was a working fridge. Although the website says 'tea and coffee making facilities', there was no milk or coffee mate provided. Food was far below the usual Sri Lankan standards (surprisingly, though it was a beach-side hotel, sea food, particularly more expensive items such as prawns and crabs, seem to be scarce). Even the need for a electric toaster at breakfast seem to have escaped their minds. Staff was friendly and obliging and appeared to be working under stress as they were short-staffed. For Sri Lankan visitors travelling in their own vehicles, be prepared to park the vehicle overnight across the road (security provided). Though the hotel itself is feature-less place (trying, but failing miserably to create a Japanese interior), there is ample beautiful beach and enough activities around that you can enjoy during your stay.","A character-less roadside hotel with a nice beach","2016-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r437289271-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is located right on the Galle road and has quite a lot of parking opposite the hotel. From the outlook this hotel presents itself as an upscale hotel without too many frills. The service was quite fast at the reception and we were in our rooms in no time. Me and my wife got a room in the up most floor and had a lot of open spaces outside the room. The rooms were very clean and was not packed with too much furniture. The issues we found with the room were, though the room was set up as a double it did not have a double bed. It was two single beds brought close together. This plus the sound directly from the main road did affect the sleep quality. The washroom was quite spacious and the clean. 

The hotel had quite a nice pool which was not too big and we were able to have a decent time in it as September is not really the season in Hikkaduwa. But I seriously have my doubt how this pool can accommodate the guests during the peak season starting from Oct/Nov. The beach right outside the hotel was not really maintained and there was quite a bit of litter close to the hotel premises. The sea seemed to be safe for sea bathing a little right to the hotel. 

The hotel did offer breakfast $8, but we thought it was not too great and did not have too many varieties for the price. There are many restaurants close by to this hotel if you want to get a decent meal. 

Overall a good hotel if you want to have a relaxed time in Hikkaduwa, but remember it is for some reason a little pricey.","An average hotel which is a bit too pricey!","2016-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r420758348-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

First impressions on arriving at the  hotel were good, spacious entrance, lovely welcoming staff, great looking pool! However the room although spacious, with a separate living area, only had air conditioning in the bedroom so the rest of the rooms were incredibly hot, unbearably so.
The restaurant was soulless and empty, once again no air conditioning was on, although we asked and the staff did turn it on. The food not good and the staff not interested.

Opening and closing times are mentioned for the convenience of service operation. But on request
No person goes unserved in our restaurant. I’m sure you would have experienced it through the obliged steward who had inquired and served you.

Place a cool 10-min drive from the airport. Check-in was a little delayed as many were waiting. Low lit open reception, with a few old British period chairs. Allotted 14A. Shown direction by a hotel person to find my way in the dark garden. Found out a house, 14A and 14B. Entered the cottage, inserted the key, lights lit, here we are to a British period railway colony house, quite worn out but they have tried their best to renovate.

Positives:-
1. Clean and neatly tucked white sheets
2. Bottled water, coffee mug, etc.
3. Calm and serene
4. Nice food and good staff at the restaurant
5. Evening music at the restaurant
6. Nice swimming pool
Negatives:-
1. Old, run down looks
2. No carpets
3. All alone finding my way in the large woods carrying my luggage
4. Unclean wash basin
5. Broken bath tub and a nasty cementing done on the white tub making it not a welcome place to step into for a bath (as a matter of fact I preferred to wash at the airport lounge later)
6. Pooling of people for drop and pickup to the airport (there seems to be a nexus between some staff and the transport personnel from Srilankan airlines-usually for business class passengers they ensure privacy of transport)

To sumup, not spook bad, but not good either, for sure a place grudgingly one could accept if no other choice, but when there are many available, why should I accept this is the question.","An okay place for transits, quiet tranquil but rooms need repairs/facelit","2018-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1500185-d308528-r641394706-Tamarind_Tree_Garden_Resort-Katunayake_Negombo_Western_Province.html",

The accommodation is in large semi-detached bungalows. Each has a living room with seating TV and a fridge, bedroom with double bed and bathroom.
The first bungalow we stayed in was in need of decorating and needed a good clean. The second bungalow was much better decorated and much cleaner.
The breakfast was buffet, with lots of choice. On a first stay there was a particularly good egg curry.
The evening meal is also buffet with plenty of choice. Unfortunately most dishes were tepid. Chef was kind enough though to cook a fresh dish of fish Masala for our table when the buffet ran out.

The room is big and modern, unfortunately  with 40 bugs and mosquitos. 
We had to ask for a spray. 
When we arrived the next evening from the tour we found our room was not cleaned. What normaly doesn't bother me at all but with 40 dead bugs all over the floor would have been nice.
Room was then cleaned on the third day after asking, but no towels changed. 
The bed linen and towels had a very bad smell and were very dirty. This needs to improve a lot.
Really disgusting, no other words for this.

Food was really good. But a lot was too spicy for  my taste.
Also communication was hard some times.

There is practically nothing to do at this hotel. There is nothing to entertain yourself with other than stare at the grass grow, though my kids had fun chasing after the stray dogs in the yard. 

The phones worked intermittently in the room. The light from the walkway outside shone in very brightly and couldn't be turned off, I only learnt when we were leaving that you could do this by walking to the end of the corridor and turning it off.

Thank you for your constructive comments, which we will definitely take on board. 
Our team always try their best to serve and make every guest feel comfortable during their stay. Please accept our apology if we disturbed your privacy as I can assure you, was not our intention.

We still believe that most of our guests spend time at Calamansi Cove Villas barefoot and outdoors on the big day beds and loungers and disappear in their villas only to sleep, so we made the most of the outdoor spaces, gardens and beachfront for total relaxation.

The WiFi is terribly slow, the bed is comfortable but there is no head board to sit on the bed comfortably. Overall it’s alright but not great.

The villas were extremely well designed and were comfortable. The pool was great too. 

The head chef had only joined three days before we arrived but all the items on their (limited) menu were very well presented and tasty. The chef - Thushara and his staff including Dulaj, Dilshan, Amila etc went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. Their service was outstanding. 

The only downside we encountered was with the quality and cleanliness of their linen. It was very old, discoloured and looked well past their use-by date. Hopefully, they can look at this seriously as it wasn't very pleasant for a good nights sleep or to use to towel yourself after a shower.

If you're looking to be away from noise and light pollution, then this place is for you. A romantic relaxing getaway with an exclusive access to a somehow private beach..

In terms of location, this place is a gem. But when you think of the area (balapitiya), there's not much to do there, except for the nearby river and lake activities. 

Now the hotel itself is something else, the rooms are very nicely designed and all, but you can see they're getting slowly rundown. The amenities are not bad, but also not so great when considering the experience that you would expect from such an ""exclusive"" place. 

The pool is nice and clean. Well maintained as well.

The restaurant and bar are next to the pool. Restaurant menu is OKAY but again, you'd expect a lot more from a place like this.. The bar's menu is not so rich, with a few cocktails and beers and some spirits..
It's worth mentioning that the chef is very good and the food was delicious.

The breakfast menu is also not very rich, offering a western breakfast with fruits and mains, in addition to a local breakfast option.

The staff are very welcoming, friendly and very hospitable. We felt really embraced by everyone there. And the service was great. Actually this place is lucky to have such an amazing staff.

Overall, I believe this place is overpriced when compared to what you're getting in exchange for your money.

Hope this is helpful, personally we might go back if we're passing by that area, but to stay for one or two nights MAX.

Our rooms were very big and specious and the food was absolutely fantastic, room service was prompt and pleasant. The pool and beach made for perfect relaxation spots, accentuated by a range of 5-star amenities.

However, our check-in experience left a lot to be improved. Despite having made the reservation, and my father even came the week before to confirm the reservation, the reception staff wasted almost 20-30 minutes to check us in and insisted on my father's ID card to complete the check in process. Although my parents were in another car and arrived about 10 to 15 minutes after us, nothing was done to facilitate the ease of our check-in process. Our bags were not even moved from the entrance to the reception. My wife and brother had to stay with them and were not even offered a cool towel or drink while they were with the luggage. Also, they required a second ID for the second room which I could have provided had they been more proactive. Finally, when we were taken to our rooms, my father mentioned all of the time wasted at check-in to the staff member who took us to the room, and all she had to say was there is new staff at reception and they have not been properly trained. What kind of excuse is this?

Disappointingly, this was not the first time we faced this issue. We had a similar check-in experience during our stay at Jetwing Blue Hotel as well, where our time was wasted by the reception staff due to apparent disorganization and inadequate training of new employees. Given that they serve as the initial point of contact for guests, it's crucial that reception staff are well-trained by upper management.

While everything beyond the reception experience was delightful and up to our expectations, it's clear Jetwing has a serious issue in employing and properly training the reception staff. The initial check-in process needs significant improvement, because first impressions upon entry is a key KPI in maintaining a hotel's standard. If the initial encounter is not met with satisfaction, it does not matter what the rest of the experience is. Hopefully, our next check-in experience will be smoother, or we might have to consider staying at Jetwing's competitor hotels in the future. Nonetheless, Jetwing Beach remains a favourite, and we hope to see improvements for a more enjoyable experience in the future.","Good Stay but Improvements Needed at Check-in","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r990333104-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

The only negative is that the hotel caters heavily to day visitors (not staying at the hotel) and maybe cannot keep up with service for the guests who are actually staying at the hotel. This is especially noticeable at the bar, where they could use some extra staff.

We stayed the night we arrived into Sri Lanka before transferring and again the night before we flew back to the UK. 

Because of this, we can't comment on the pools, facilities etc. as we didn't get a chance to use them. 

However, the staff are really welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived. The welcome drink and cold towel when we first got in was appreciated! We had a really lovely room, nice and spacious with tea/coffee making facilities, modern TV and access to Netflix for when the monsoon rains hit! 

The food in the restaurant was really good, breakfast was the highlight. The set menu does make it quite a bit of food so make sure you go hungry (!) but it's really well presented and tasted lovely. 

Our only issue was the noise levels. On both nights that we stayed, we were woken multiple times during the night by either dogs barking/howling on the beach, guests or staff talking at really loud levels in the corridors/rooms and the staff clearing room service plates. 

The final straw came when someone was clearly collecting room service plates for a large party and spent a good 20 mins outside our room door scraping food and noisily piling plates up at 2am! It seemed common sense to us not to do this loudly in the middle of the night but when we asked the man to be quiet, he seemed quite shocked as to why we asked!

It's a shame as if it wasn't for this, we wouldn't have hesitated to recommend the hotel.","Fantastic staff, nice hotel - just noisy!","2023-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r894991797-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We have written to the Management of Jetwing regarding the issue after our return from the holiday.  No response as yet from them.
Wifii provision on tour operated vehicles is an imporant amentity and must be mandatory.
Accessing the Internet especially during our travel/tour has become internationally so engrained in our day to day necessaity rathan than a mear leisure that having to pay for it (or worse still, not having access to it at all) seems well...... rather ridiculous.
It would be worthwhile mentioning and bringing to Jetwings attention that having access to free and fast WiFi on tourist travel vehicles means that guests can stay in touch with their families at any given time during the road travel.  And happy guests mean better tour travel experiences. Provided free and fast WiFi access will help them feel relaxed and satisfied making the most of their holiday and avoid the Guests additional roaming internatinal charges.

The room was ok, a lot of mosquitoes when we arrived and we had to tell reception to bring some balm/spray. We were horrified to find lipstick on one of the drinking cups, as this was our last stay we didn't make a fuss but not what we expected from this hotel. 

The food at the restaurant was good and a good range to choose from.

However service was terrible,
Had to go and stand in the dining area waiting until a waiter was available to come and show a table. Took a long time to clean and lay the table. Tables were not sanitized properly. 
No temperate checks or sanitisation for guests on arrival. No safety measures taken whatsoever. Very concerning the completed disregard for Covid protocols. Other hotels have take stringent health safety measures. 
Staff are under trained and clueless. Very poor service.
Food was good. 
Beach front is large and wide. But the sea itself in this area not friendly for swimming or sea bathing so not much you could do besides using the pool, walking on the beach, and sleeping in the room!
View of the sea from rooms blocked to an extent by coconut trees so view isn’t great from upper floors. Ground floor is adjacent to the pool so may get noisy when the pool is full of people. 

Also car park is on the opposite side of road from the hotel. Guests must unload bags and drive to the car park and cross the road!!!

Jetwing hotels compromise of many uniquely designed hotels throughout Sri Lanka in order to deliver a unique experience each time you visit them. Whilst we understand that our hotel does come off as rustic in its design we assure you that the amenities and services provided are always delivered with the highest standards to ensure a world class customer experience is delivered to each of our valued guests. 
 
We are sad however that our overall atmosphere is not what you expected and we would really encourage you to try the many other hotels Jetwing has to offer that might better suit your expectations. 
We are happy to know that you enjoyed the spacious and comfortable room allocated for you, the pool and Pristine beach. 

We hope to see you once more and share more wonderful experiences and memories with us.

Ayubowan!

It was the first time that I found a spoiled pasta with a bad smell. Is there no one to check the quality of the food produced in the hotel and test it? I wanted to talk to the executive chef about this, but unfortunately it did not happen. 
It is disgusting that a buffet in a hotel is at such a low level. The pasta salad in the buffet was not good, so I took one from Action Kitchen. I am sorry to say that it was not made as described. It also had no taste. I am thinking about this.

Thank you for your feedback and review. We are truly glad that you found our offerings to your liking.
To address your feedback regarding the AC unit switching off, the switch you are referring to, is the master switch which is wired to switch off all lighting and the AC unit in the room. However, we would like to apologize for not clarifying this in advance. Furthermore, we also would like to apologize for the noise. Although our rooms are built to deflect as much of the noise as possible, due to our city location it is somewhat inevitable to completely drown-out exterior noises. Once again we would like to thank you for your patronage and hope you will be visiting us again soon.

Overall not a bad hotel if you are looking for a cheaper room in Colombo zone 2 (hotel district i am told)

Pool
There was a rooftop pool that looked lovely and was great views at the top of hotel, the pool was freezing however and there was no sun loungers and the pool was covered but would not have been able to sunbathe
Staff
Upon check in they were really friendly and even upgraded our room to one with a balcony
When we decided not to stay a second night the staff were really helpful and helped us arrange a taxi
Room 
The bathroom is just a glass wall with a see through blind so if someone if using the toilet you can see and hear everything
The room itself felt quite small, it was long but it felt squashed, it was well decorated and it was comfortable and the bathroom had soap and shampoo
At night there was some kind of party with really loud music ( we had a long day travelling) it did stop before we went to sleep but you could hear the road noise 
Hotel 
The decor of the hotel was nice very modern and it has everything you need, with a rooftop bar and pool and a restaurant. The ground floor just had a reception and a small business room and one toilet and everything else was on a high floor. The stairways were quite narrow.
The bar was on the rooftop and when we arrived there was a DJ playing and we were informed the bar would close at 10.30pm. We did not have a drink but it seemed a nice atmosphere
Good WIFI throughout

Food 
We only ate breakfast here, there was a small selection and it was help yourself but there was enough to eat, well stocked and fresh

Location 
I didn't check out what was local other than the supermarket and that was super close, the hotel could have arranged a taxi if needed","Nice hotel but not sound proof","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r747564333-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Also the hotel should improve more on the skills of their restaurant and kitchen staff, every time we ordered room service we had to wait  for long time to get our food and drinks, we had to call & ask why it’s taking too long. It’s not that the hotel was full it’s simply the lack of skills of the staff, One day when I ordered food and drink for my son, we waited for more than an hour & as usual I called & checked & was told the food will be delivered soon, but after another 15 minutes the guy came only with the drink and no food, we were told that they are unable to accommodate our request, this they told us after waiting for the food for more that an hour which they should hv told us when we placed our order, I was so angry because by then my son was crying as he was super hungry and I had to order food from an outside restaurant. I was very disappointed with the hotel that day.

Special thanks to Nadeeshani & Nissanka at the front desk for exceptional customer service during our stay.

House keeping guys did a great job everyday.

The location of the hotel is excellent very convenient.

I would definitely think twice before booking Me Colombo again.

Nice design property, located in Colombo 5.

CONs
- room not ready at the time of check-in (but, true to be told, they granted us a free upgrade for that)
- charge on credit card not completely clear (they billed me in advance in USD and because of a ""bizarre"" rate exchange 97,74 USD seem to be equal to 98,07 EUR ! 🤔)
- some work of maintenance is needed all around the hotel (i.e.repainting some walls, changing some cushions with holes, etc.)
- small bathroom and with no privacy (at night, the curtains does not work properly)
- no licence for alcoholic drinks (yet) but, despite that, they (already) have a menu full of cocktails and liquors
- restaurant at 1st floor not available for dinner, because of a private event which would have been held the next morning/afternoon
- poor value for money

PROs
- attentive and helpful staff (greatly appreciated the advice about the metered tuk tuks and the ""PickMe"" app: thanks a lot!)
- delicious breakfast
- swimming pool at the rooftop","Disappointing","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r660666099-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The negatives - Although a new hotel it is quickly showing signs of wear and tear. Strange decisions seem to have been made in the planning, for example there are no sunbeds around the pool area. On the rooftop bar & pool area they have a toilet, but no sink for hand washing - bizarre! 
While staff were polite, they were extremely difficult to locate and did not give clear information. We ordered mini burgers&fries with an extra side of fries and they charged us 1,000 rupees for the fries - more than the cost of the burger.

thanks for your review and sorry to hear that you were not happy with your stay. Our double rooms have 25m² plus 10m² bathroom plus 12m² balcony. They feature kings size double beds with good mattresses and mosquito nets. They have air condition, fridge, locker, water cooker, telephone and satellite TV. The bathrooms have big showers with hot water with high pressure. So I think they are not so basic. Correct, they do not have a closet but a rack for suitcases and hooks to hang things, as most guests only stay for one or two nights.
The list price for the winter season 24/25 for a double room with breakfast is £67. Half board is £7,40 per person for a 3 course menu. You are always welcome to convert this amount to a la cart order from our menu. I don't know where you paid the £200 per night.

The staff were friendly but the room was basic, no storage for clothes, it could have done with a deep clean and the bathroom was full of insects. Our company had booked us for half board, but the food choices were limited, just 3 options, and they weren't great. Breakfast wasn't much better with cold eggs and the worst jam ever encountered. Drinks were expensive. We went for a swim and for an hour a groundsman used a very noisy power tool right next to us. We asked him to stop, which after 5 minutes or so he did. A manhole cover was left off at the pool surround. After some time, my husband replaced it as no staff were apparent to do so, and it was dangerous. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony, although there was no view, but we did see some birds and a giant squirrel.

thanks for your review. Sorry to hear that the cats were annoying. We have 3 of them and they usually don’t bother our guests, but one of them was in season, so all neighbours cats showed up at our place to have a party. Meanwhile we visited the vet with our cat, so this type of party shouldn’t happen again.
If you are allergic you can always use the first floor of our restaurants. Cats don’t go there.
The new signs for our access road are already in production - we had to move the rocks with the arrows to the other side of the road, due to construction works.

Swimming pool is open 24 hours and is nice & clean.

Cons:

There are too many cats in the dining area mewing and jumping on to your lap making dining there very unsanitary & annoying. If you have a cat-allergy, avoid this place by all means!

The food was so so. We had our breakfast on the balcony to avoid the dining room and it was good with plenty of fruit.

The entrance to the hotel has very confusing directions that can easily be corrected if the owner or a worker spent 10 minutes with white paint & a brush.

We stayed for 3 nights, it’s basic but I think it has everything you need, nice pool, big spacious rooms, mosquito nets, air con.

Communication with the staff wasn’t the best, they asked us to order dinner in the mornings with a set time to eat. And on arrival 3pm we asked for Sri Lankan curry (vegetable) as we don’t eat meat and they said it wasn’t possible but would try for the 2nd night, so we had veg rice and veg noodles (the only other option) 

2nd/3rd night curry was good, although not sure they grasped the not eating meat as chicken was served first. 

Packed lunch for Safari wasn’t suitable (apart from fruit) but we weren’t given another option. 

Loved the resident Cat (Lynx) and the dogs who occasionally showed their faces. 

Overall it was good, but I’d probably try somewhere else next time. ","3.5 - Good","2019-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d13804085-r648692704-Jungle_Paradise-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

Room was very good as well, not large but well equipped, incl. a faux fireplace. However, other parts of the hotel lack flair, eg the bar. 

Service is good and staff very eager to please, with a tendency to be obtrusive. We received various calls/visits to check if everything is in order. 

Dinner was disappointing. There is only a buffet option at LKR 3,200 pp. Buffet was huge but mainly catered to Chinese guests, with a small corner of local curries. Quality was mediocre and value for money not good, maybe we were unlucky that evening. On the other hand, local breakfast was very good. 

Bottom-line: not a bad hotel at all but too expensive for the product experienced, maybe due to the generally high price level in April.

Large King bed and spacious room.  The hotel is set among local tea and vegetable properties with the locals going about their daily routines.  We loved the room and the staff were very helpful  Would like to give the hotel 5 stars but the dining was very poor.  We had two dinners and two breakfasts.  Whilst the staff did their best they did not seem to have any idea how to present food other than the local curries. The buffet breakfast for example was cold .  When this was mentioned to the hotel management they did not seem to understand that the warming trays had to be hot.  The bacon was cold, bake beans cold and the same with other items.  The only warm food was the eggs because they were cooked fresh plus the local curries.","Great location and lovely hotel","2019-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d9554036-r666825099-The_Blackpool_Resort_Spa-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Pros:
Hotel is beautiful. The staff was very friendly. We were given a warm welcome and well looked after. Rooms are spacious and there’s a nice fireplace to keep you warm in the cool clime. Food was very delicious. 5/5 for their hospitality. 

Cons:
The room amenities. THEY ARE REUSING SLIPPERS AND LAUNDRY BAGS! So better to have your own if you are going to stay at this hotel. 

I am not a person who is social media friendly and I must say that I had to create this TripAdvisor just to give you this ‘GOOD’ comment according to your GENERAL MANAGER. 

We were insisted to comment on TripAdvisor from the general manager whenever we were seen to him (particularly around the dinner table, we all were given business cards (He’s mistaken them to leaflets I believe haha) when we did not even ask for any from him. I find it very disturbing and unprofessional. We have been to many hotels but this is the first time we had to come across this kind of an experience. 

Comment is something we heartily give if we are beyond our satisfactions but this was a complete impel I would say.

As others have mentioned, there's nothing to do around it and you'll have to drive 15-20 minutes if you want to buy something, look for a place to eat or just take a walk in the quite dusty, dirty and characterless city. Our room was large and  had all amenities expected, the bathroom was large and had bathtub as well, and there was also large/long balcony overlooking the pool. The furniture of the room was a bit strange, perhaps more appropriate for a certain type of residence than a hotel, at least in our view. The overall attitude of the personnel was average, at the best. The reception staff was quite inquisitive about personal issues and perhaps their records should be better kept, considering that upon checking out we were asked to pay for a dinner bill that did not bear our signature and did not belonged to us.The person in charge of the restaurant was summoned, was quite aggressive at the beginning, but the mistake was realized, apologies we given and accepted. The whole process, however, took longer than it should have and did not leave us with a good feeling. I believe that the hotel staff could use some serious, professional,  hospitality industry type, customer service training. For us, it was an experience we are unlikely to repeat...

"0","1006996768","en","1181608",,"General Manager","1007527477","en","2025-05-14","David Hopps","There is much about this review that concerns us. We have held a management meeting this morning about the points raised and would like to make the following observations.
Re the antagonistic Service mark of 1/5 - this compares with a run of reviews where our service is persistently highly praised. If the guest was so aggrieved by the confusion shown over the breakfast menu a la carte by a temporary steward we regret that any concerns were not raised with a senior member of staff which would have provided an immediate and amicable solution, and addressed the guest's ""uncomfortable"" feeling. Life is so much happier that way.
Re the ""miserable"" steward - as we do not believe this was not raised at the time, we are unable to make any worthwhile conclusion. But we are disturbed by the unfair implications in the somewhat overwrought suggestion that the guest did not like to use the courtyard pool because ""they"" were ""congregating"" around it. We are made uncomfortable by the word ""they"" in this context. 
Re the high mattress - it is true that we replaced all our mattresses in the past year and, as our commitment to the highest available quality we did opt for an extra mattress depth of 2 inches. If this makes the mattress higher on our antique four-poster beds, we think it is a small price to pay for the quality. We could have provided a stool on request.
Re the ""dated"" hotel - we believe we are a rare thing, a historic Sri Lanka hotel on the beach. We remain committed to large investments in keeping with the hotel's essential character and the provision of all modern amenities. At the current time, all our ground-floor bathrooms are having a full refurbishment, for example. That historic nature is our USP and it is why so many guests love us. People who want an obviously contemporary hotel should take more care when planning to book a contemporary hotel. We make this absolutely clear to all guests booking with us.

Maintenant qu’elles sont publiques, nous aimerions poliment faire les observations suivantes : nous acceptons le paiement à l’arrivée (le client peut voir la chambre s’il le souhaite) pour ce que nous considérons comme de bonnes raisons. Nous sommes surpris que le client n’ait pas vécu cela au Sri Lanka auparavant. Nous savons par notre propre expérience (j’ai personnellement travaillé en étroite collaboration avec des centaines d’hôtels de premier plan au Sri Lanka au cours des 20 dernières années) que c’est une pratique courante et nous pensons qu’elle crée une relation plus saine entre le client et le personnel. Cela signifie également que nous ne perdons pas de temps à courir après les clients pour obtenir un paiement qui pourrait être mieux utilisé pour servir tous nos clients d’une autre manière. Et cela signifie également que les clients ne partent pas (délibérément ou accidentellement) sans avoir payé. Et parfois, que cela nous plaise ou non, ils le font. La politique restera donc la même pour le bon fonctionnement de l’hôtel. Cela attire environ trois plaintes par an, ce qui est toujours décevant mais nous pensons que c’est nécessaire. En ce qui concerne les investissements, nous avons beaucoup investi dans Suite Lanka au cours des quatre dernières années et nous continuerons à le faire chaque fois que les fonds le permettront.
En ce qui concerne la performance des stewards sur la plage, nous considérons que les critiques sont largement fondées, car notre performance au cours des deux dernières semaines a été inférieure à ce que nous attendions. Cela est dû en partie – mais pas entièrement – ​​à l’absence inévitable du personnel pour des raisons personnelles. Nous avons nommé un nouveau steward cette semaine et une formation sera dispensée aux stewards actuels pour garantir une approche plus proactive. Nous sommes reconnaissants aux clients récents qui nous ont fait part de cette question. En ce qui concerne les prix, nous savons que nos prix restent compétitifs, même si notre succès signifie que nous avons dû nous enregistrer à la TVA et à la SSCL, ce qui ajoute un total de 21 % à nos coûts. Dans le monde entier, les hôtels ont du mal à répondre au désir des clients d’un excellent niveau de qualité tout en souhaitant des prix identiques à ceux d’il y a 10 ou 15 ans en période de crise économique. C’est un véritable défi et la plupart des commentaires de Tripadvisor suggèrent que nous sommes en train de le relever.

Tres bon, tres sympa!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nous voyagions en famille avec nos 2 enfants. 

L’hotel est joli mais a besoin d’un petit coup de rénovation. C’est agréable d’avoir un accès direct à la plage qui est très belle aussi. Attention, ce n’est pas une plage de baignade, on peut jouer avec les vagues prudemment et nous y avons passé de très bons moments. 

La piscine est sympa aussi même si finalement pas indispensable tellement la plage est agréable. Peut être bien pour les plus petits enfants. 

Je mets 3 étoiles car pour moi, le service n’est pas à la hauteur de tous les autres hôtels que nous avons fait au Sri Lanka alors que celui-ci était de loin de plus cher. Parasols cassés dont personne ne se soucie, vous devez trouver quelqu’un pour demander un matelas, pas de pro activité. Et quand je dis « trouver » quelqu’un c’est parce que parfois, côté plage, vous avez l’impression qu’il n’y a pas de personnel… 

Finalement, on est mieux servi que par soi même mais pour le prix, je ne trouve pas ça ok. 

Pendant plus de 2 jours on a assisté a des querelles et accouplement de chiens à toute heure du jour et de la nuit au sein de l’hotel, entre les transats… 

A l’arrivée, vous n’avez pas le temps de vous poser qu’on vous demande deja de payer l’entièreté du séjour. Première fois que je voyais ça. 

On sent clairement que sur la cote de manière générale, on est plus dans le business que dans l’accueil, pourtant si présent chez les Sri Lankais.

"0","910662430","en","1181608",,"General Manager","911095091","en","2023-08-17","David Hopps","Dear Mr Mulders
As you will be aware this is the third site on which we have responded to your comments about stray dogs - the fourth if you count our private messages when I investigated the points you raised further - and provided infirmation. This infrmation has not led you to edit your comments so apologies if this is becoming repetitive but I must again provide some context to the points you raise.
As you will now be aware we have made considerable efforts to manage the recent, sporadic presence of stray dogs (a possibility on all Sri Lanka beaches). We seek to do so in a humane manner which prioritises the safety and well-being of our guests. We support all efforts in Sri Lanka for sterilisation of stray dogs where these efforts will be of benefit to local communities and we are encouraging the local Hoteliers' Association to become involved. We provide infographics in all guest rooms and in the menus in our beach restaurant (you may have seen them) appealing to guests not to feed or encourage the dogs: Sadly, a minority ignore this request out of a caring but we believe misguided desire to look after the dogs and this does not help the situation. Staff are instructed to prevent any stray dog from entering the hotel and, by and large, they take these responsibiiities seriously, but beach restaurants open to the beach, while being a dream location, also have obvious challenges. Clearly, as we seek to build Suite lanka's reputation, we would be stupid not to take them seriously.
We also asked you to give us more details about which member of staff you spoke to about the problems with the safe. We regard a working safe as an essential basic facility. The person you reported the issue to simply forgot during an emergency 14-hour shift caused by illness to other staff members. As far as we know, you did not remind anybosy after your initial reporting of the issue? Please correct us if not. Despte the staff member's obvious commitment, on this issue we fell  below our expected standards. We regard a working safe in every room as a basic necessity. 
On the subject of the towels, we have replaced a huge amount of towels this season and we use the best laundry in the area and we cannot identify any problem.
As for the sea, you came to the south-west coast in low season in August - a time of year when, although the weather is normally good, the seas are still high and when swimming cannot be guaranteed. Safe swimming can be relied upon perhaps only on the east coast at this time of year. We are grateful for the efforts of our neighbouring hotel to provide red flag warnings when they deem this to be appropriate, as well as the presence of a lifeguard.
Thank-you for staying with us and we regret that you do not appear to have found the same satisfaction as the vast majority of our guests this year. We wish you had given us more opportunity to address this during your stay as we believe that amicable communication is the best way to ensure a happy holiday. In the meantime, I have noted your instruction to us to address these matters promptly. Travel safely.

The accommodation is comfortable and provides a pleasant experience. However, there are a few areas that require improvement. Firstly, the staff should prioritize ensuring that stray dogs do not roam around in the dining areas. This can be unsettling for guests and affects the overall dining experience. Secondly, during my stay, the locker in my room was promised to be fixed, but unfortunately, this never happened. This lack of follow-through on promises was disappointing. Additionally, the towels provided had an unpleasant smell, which was not ideal for a hotel of this caliber. Lastly, while the hotel boasts a beachfront location, it is important to note that swimming in the sea may not be feasible due to the presence of red flags and strong currents. Overall, Suite Lanka has potential, but certain aspects need attention and improvement for a more satisfying stay.","Suite Lanka is an oke place to stay","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r910662430-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

first of all thank you for having stayed with us and for taking the time to write a review.
However I would have appreciated, if you would have told me, what has made you unhappy, as we had a nice conversation together.
As I always appreciate guests feedback to improve our services and facilities, it would be great to understand what you meant with ""A/C just ok"". What the A/C should have done besides cooling down your room?

With regards to the ""dirty bedding"", what exactly do you mean? When you realized that the room boy saw stains or similar, but didn´t change it, why didn´t you tell him to do so?  Every room has a note mentioning, that we change the bedding every 4 nights unless the guests requests an early replacement. However I apologize, if you felt that your cleaning has been neglected.

Regarding the breakfast, please be so kind and give us your ""constructive"" advice, what could be done, that the breakfast doesn´t appear ""basic"" to you, especially because usually we are praised for our first meal of the day.

Again thank you for giving us the opportunity to improve our services.
I hope, that we will have the chance to serve you even better on your next visit to this beautiful country.

thank you very much for taking your time to comment on your stay, which is always helpful to improve the standard and the services.
But let me comment on some points you have mentioned to clarify:
1. You are right that swimming in the sea in front of the hotel is not advisable, but mainly during the months may through november. The remaining months the sea is fine. However one should be a good swimmer, because the surf is pretty strong and challenging even for body surfers. This year the sea became more rough earlier than normal.
2. Curtains: Yes, they are white and therefore they don´t block the light during the day, but the view. 
3. Towels: We use only towels fresh from the laundry, but as I am not 100% satisfied as well, we have just changed the provider to THE LAUNDRY GALLE (provides laundry services to the AMAN hotels etc.). 
4. Toiletries: We offer shampoo/shower gel in the shower
5. Hair Dryer: Can be obtained on request, because they turned out to be preferred souvenirs.
6. Air Condition: We had some problems with your particular A/C during your stay. Due to the strong seabreeze we have A/C problems more often than one would face them in city hotels. However that´s why generally maintenance staff would be on site within a couple of hours. Unfortunately your stay felt into the srilankan new year period, where almost ""everybody"" is travelling home and services are very limited. In your case we were helped only the next day. I apologize for that. However you were offered instantly an ""upgrade"" to one of our suites downstairs or even to our Penthouse on the top floor. Plus we offered you a free dinner. Please let me know what else we could have done to make you happy?  

Again I am sorry that the technical issue has caused so much trouble on your stay with us and I hope that you will give us the chance to serve you better during an other stay in the future.

With kind regards, Roland

Right on the beach but you can't swim there or even jump in the waves. You can swim in front of Hikka Tranz or take tuk tuk to Unawatuna. Plenty of restaurants around, JHL next to Hikka Tranz highly recommended and Cinnamon guest house next door had amazing seafood platter.
Charming building with colonial feel and great spacious balcony with beautiful view, wifi signal strong, comfortable bed but pillows very hard and high. Breakfast can be served anytime and on your balcony if you wish. Staff welcoming,friendly, always smiling and trying hard to please the guests especially Damith but clueless most of the time as speak no English and often get things wrong. The only person who speaks English is the manager but he leaves in the evening so at night there's no one (only security guard who can not communicate). 

Curtains in the room are thin and don't block the light so the room is very bright since early morning and it wakes you up.
Towels old and worn out with strong smell, was reluctant to put them on my face, no toiletries, no hair drier.
Pool useless as located in the backyard surrounded by walls and kitchen entrance and window so no privacy and no nice setting.
The biggest problem is the a/c, in the deluxe corner room its very noisy with constant rattling sound and located just above the bed so peaceful sleep impossible. It regularly stops working and trips the circuit breaker so we had to always look for the staff and ask them to put it back, obviously when it stops at night you're left sweating in a steaming hot room. Manager was really apologizing and looking for a solution, offered higher category rooms on ground and 2nd floor but we opted to stay as we specifically booked the room for the balcony. We got a free meal then.

The property is advertised as 4* on booking.com and ""luxury"" on trip advisor however this is misleading as amenities offered don't match the price tag. Bottom line do your research as for the same price you can get much much more in Sri Lanka.","Nice setting, faulty A/C and terribly overpriced","2016-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r366593126-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It is a beautiful building and I loved the traditional furnishings. I knew it wasn't going to be a modern 4 star lodging, this is a small beach resort in Sri Lanka. It backed on to a vast stretch of beach and this was on the quiet stretch. Had the place to ourselves. It is true that the sea is dangerous here. The waves are huge and the current too strong to paddle in. 

Food choice was limited and getting wifi was a mammoth challenge daily. I would advise picking time of year wisely as we went in rainy season and 2 of our 5 nights we were bedroom bound becasue the rain was torrential and impossible to go out in. We had to order room service which of course was limited. 

Staff were very friendly and there is a small pool in the courtyard to enjoy in the heat.

Although the beach is only 50 meters from your door the ocean is too dangerous with under currents and rip tides to swim in, a point the brochure do not mention 

We sadly had a poor experience. We somebody walking off the beach and trying to get into our room at 4.15am one morning. It was all a bit scary but highlighted by the fact the would be villain must have walked straight past the ""all night security"" who are supposed to prevent this. 

The manager did not take the situation seriously, although he promised the windows would be screwed shut for the next evening, this did not happen. I eventually at 10pm at night had to find some wire and do the best I could and wire the windows shut.

The rooms were spacious, well-maintained, and extremely comfortable. The food was delicious, offering a variety of options, and the housekeeping service was commendable.

However, we did face some service issues. When we checked in, Mr. Abdeen, who was responsible for taking our luggage from reception to our room, refused to lift my handbag, stating that he could not carry a bag containing a water bottle. Additionally, he did not handle the luggage carefully, and my bag was nearly damaged in the process.

At the restaurant, Mr. Ashwin's behavior was disappointing. He repeatedly asked how many people were dining and the ages of the children. During final billing, he unnecessarily checked the passports multiple times for age verification. Worse still, he added extra persons to the bill assuming we wouldn’t notice, as we were a group. But we were very well aware of our count and cross-checked the bill, asking him to revise it. After being corrected, he responded by saying he would check the CCTV footage to verify, which was quite unprofessional and uncomfortable. As we were honest, he found nothing wrong.

Mr. Ashwin needs significant training in customer service and polite behavior. His attitude affected an otherwise wonderful stay.

Despite these issues, everything else—from the rooms to the food and housekeeping—was excellent. With better training for some staff members, this hotel can truly offer a flawless experience.

Would still recommend this hotel for its overall quality and amenities.","Got it!

With regard to the complication of the room booking, It was a third party booking which we did not receive until you arrived to the hotel and again we had to cross check with all the agents as it was a pre paid booking. If it was a direct booking, immediately we would have checked in you to the room.However we tried out to solve the issue as early as possible to get the confirmation,still the response from the agent was delayed.

They had trouble locating my booking at first and was trying to figure it out and they let me sit there for 45 min without an update which isn’t ideal after traveling 24 hours. Also note that the pool and pool area is a lot smaller irl where only 10 people can fit in the pool at the same time which might cause a problem during peak season.

Greetings from Mandarina Colombo!

Yes we know who you are. You may have a pseudo name on TripAdvisor called tooteem, but your fake and false review will not phase us. 

Why is your review false and fake? It is so because you had put the same exact thing on Tripadvisor during your stay at the hotel on 07th JAN 2020 and as we do with all feedback, when we checked on it and met you, you clearly stated that you did it because you were upset that we didn't give a late checkout till 5PM for free.

Didn't you read the email which we sent you on the 05th JAN 2020 when you inquired about a late checkout. We had clearly stated that we will offer a free late checkout till 2PM and after which it will be chargeable.

Obviously we only give late checkout till 2PM for free after-all we are a business, but you were upset that we didn't confirm a late checkout till 5PM for free, 

You may not recall but we do have records to prove that you yourself stated that you will only remove the fake and false review which you had put on TripAdvisor during your stay after we spoke to you. You also claimed that this was put in anger because we didn't agree to a late checkout till 5PM. 

We have the entire conversation recorded because we knew that if you could falsely accuse us just out of anger, then you would not have it in you to honor your word but we gave you the benefit of the doubt and trusted you enough to give you your late checkout.

We thought you were genuine and but its our fault too. It is our fault too because we you took advantage of us and you took your late checkout for free, you yourself removed the review and now it's back again because you just could not be genuinely happy that you got what you wanted.

We honestly believe in ethics and a gentleman's word as being his bond and when we promise it, we deliver and we honor it. You however have failed to stick to your own ethics and given word.

It truly hurts to know that there are unethical persons in the world who do unethical things just to get what they want.

When we now reached out to you on WhatsApp asking you why you did this to us, you simply had no remorse that you took advantage of us.

We are ashamed of you and please never come to our hotel again.

We would also like to put it on record that, we do get negative feedback from time to time but we take them in high spirit as there is always something there in the feedback for us to improve, but with your fake and false review, we outright reject it and hope that you grow out of this ethic-less ethos.

Kind Regards

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review regarding your recent stay with us.

We usually receive high praise from our guests and the team is known to reach out and ensure that your stay is kept to be as comfortable as possible and we are glad that our colleagues were able to assist you during your stay, but it seems that despite our best efforts, we seem to have let ourselves down and not lived up to our reputation. 

Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of the entire team but we would also like to bring to your attention that whilst you stay at Mandarina Colombo, it is our responsibility to ensure that you have a wonderful stay and being located smack dab in the middle of the city centre in close proximity to the most prominent restaurants and outlets there definitely is a tradeoff we have to be close to the main roads for the easy access and connectivity and this unfortunately does mean that you do witness the hustle and bustle of the rapidly moving Colombo City. 

With all that real estate is very expensive and we're certain that you will agree with us on this as such the pool has been designed and built right on the rooftop such that we maximize the space we have available to us but also at the same time ensuing that our guests have the best view and the best experience. 

As for the construction taking place on a site opposite to the hotel, unfortunately the same is beyond our control as it is not construction to do with the hotel and leaves us with no jurisdiction to intervene. Nevertheless as rightfully observed there is indeed a lot happening in Colombo as the city is rapidly developing, nevertheless we do apologize for any inconveniences caused in this regard. 

As for not having a bar, you are absolutely right, we do not have a bar and we do not serve any high spirited drinks simply due to the fact that we conform to a crescent rating standard which is quite popular in many countries, which revolves on the idea that guests can still have a wonderful stay ""bar the drinks"". 

With that being said, we are aware that some guests would love to enjoy this facility and such our front desk team is equipped with information to direct our guests to the closest bar which is only a stones throw away.

Your feedback will certainly allow us to stay true to our promise and offer guests exactly if not more than what they book and nothing less. 

Warm Regards, 

Sales Manager

We take this opportunity to thank you for selecting Mandarina Colombo Hotel and for the time taken in sharing your valuable feedback. 

We will certainly share this with our team so that they may also know and improve on their services, and as for the carpets, we have duly noted your critical feedback and although the hotel is only 2 years old, yes, we do agree the carpets need replacing and the good news is that, in the months of NOVEMBER, we managed to replace almost 50% of the rooms with new carpets, but we still have 50% of the rooms remaining and we are in the process of getting these replaced too as and when we foresee low occupancy but as the hotel is constantly running on high occupancy, this does become a challenge, nevertheless this is one of the top priorities in our to-do list.

We sincerely appreciate your patronage and certainly do look forward to welcoming your family back at Mandarina Colombo, during the next visit to Sri Lanka.

While the hotel itself is beautiful and the location is stunning, my overall experience was disappointing due to a lack of proper communication. One of the key things guests should be aware of is that buffet meals are only provided if there are more than 50 guests staying at the hotel. Otherwise, meals are served as a limited set menu — something I was only informed about after I checked in, despite booking my stay a month in advance. 

This isn't just about the buffet. It's about how the lack of transparency can affect the entire guest experience. When you're paying a premium price, there should be more consideration and flexibility around such matters. 

I’ve stayed in other hotels across Sri Lanka — even during the fuel crisis — and they still managed to provide buffets and excellent service, regardless of guest count. So it’s disappointing that a hotel of Jetwing’s reputation doesn’t communicate clearly or make such efforts. 

To be clear, I don’t blame the staff — they were friendly and did their best. But this is a management issue. Guests should be informed of important service limitations ahead of time so they can make informed decisions. 

Again, it’s not just about the buffet — it’s about how such things, when poorly handled, can negatively impact what could’ve been a memorable stay.","Beautiful Hotel, But Poor Communication and Disappointing Guest Experience","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1013621756-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed the lovely room, our friendly staff, the restaurant and the beautiful view from our property. We appreciate your kind words and are grateful for your positive comments.

We also truly value your input on the aspects that could have been improved during your stay. I would like to address a couple of concerns you raised regarding the service and the level of attention given to guests of Indian descent.

Our hotel is proudly owned by a Sri Lankan company and we are committed to treating all of our guests equally, regardless of their ethnicity or background. However, I would like to clarify that during your stay, we had a particularly high number of Indian guests, many of whom had specific dietary needs, including food allergies. As a result, our team took special care to ensure their dietary restrictions were properly addressed, which may have led to the impression that additional attention was being provided. We always aim to give all guests the best service possible, and it was never our intention for you to feel overlooked or second-rate.

Regarding the repeated request for your room number, we understand your concern. Please note that this is a standard practice we follow only in the restaurants to ensure accuracy for our guests. However, apart from the restaurant, it is not our usual procedure to request room numbers in other areas of the hotel. We will certainly look into this matter further to ensure it does not happen again.

Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback. We will continue to focus on improving our service and ensure that all of our guests feel equally valued during their stay. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with an even more enjoyable experience.

Ayubowan !(May you live long)

Negatives were sadly that Galle is run down unless you go to the fortress which is lovely. Therefore the hotel backs onto a busy street with 1.5mile of rubbish and traffic until you reach the fortress.

In the hotel we were regularly asked our room number. Which I understand in the restaurant is essential, but there was no reason to be asked in the corridors etc

Also the hotel is Indian owned, and managed.. sadly we experienced that Indian guests, or foreign guests of Indian descent received far more attention in the restaurant or around the hotel than western or white ethnicity guests.
Initially we shrugged this off, but over our 5 night stay this made one feel second rate.","Indian owned and Indian guests given preference","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r988220559-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay. We are glad you found our beachfront location and the aesthetics of the hotel beautiful, and that you enjoyed the size and cleanliness of your room, as well as the comfortable bed. 

However, we sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced, particularly the smell of sewage in your room. This is certainly not the standard that we aim for, and we will immediately investigate this matter with our maintenance team to identify the source of the problem and implement a solution. 

We also regret that you were disappointed with the dining experiences and the spa services. We take your comments about the breakfast, restaurant portions, food quality and the message very seriously. 

Finally, we understand the inconvenience caused by the lack of an elevator to only one wing whereas we have two other elevator for two other building in the hotel, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.   

We are committed to improving our attention to detail and overall management. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we will use it to address the issues you raised and enhance the guest experience. While we understand your current position, we hope you might consider giving us another opportunity in the future to demonstrate the positive changers we are implementing.

They were hardly receptive to my complaint and didn't seem to understand when i pointed out that no store even sells glass shampoo bottles and that's for the risk it poses inside a wet place.

I really enjoyed the hotel's environment, being right next to the coast. Imagine having breakfast while listening to the waves crashing against the rocks—it’s truly delightful.

As for the hardware, the rooms are very spacious. The room we stayed in had a great view of the pool and the sea. The hotel has two swimming pools, and the restaurant wasn’t crowded for dinner since it’s currently the off-season.

However, one issue led me to give a 3-star rating for this stay. If it weren't for this incident, I would have given a 4 or 5-star rating. The issue is that some basic appliances in the room need to be checked and replaced! If not, they can pose a danger to guests.

Here’s what happened: The iron in my parents' room wasn’t working, so my father came to my room to borrow my iron. As soon as he plugged it in, there was suddenly a loud BOOM like an explosion, and bright sparks came out of the socket. My father got an electric shock, and there was a one-square-inch black mark on his right palm where he was holding the iron. We were all very shocked! Then the electricity in the room tripped. After we calmed down, I checked the iron and found that the end of the cord was already cracked and damaged (but you wouldn’t notice it unless you pulled the cord out a bit).

This incident was very concerning, and I believe it’s important for the hotel to regularly inspect and replace such items to ensure guest safety.

They are well preserved. Sunsets are amazing here and the lobby and the restaurant has nice views.
But avoid the weekends like plague if you are looking for some peace and quiet downtime. The weekends are discounted and the hotel gets packed with screaming kids and family. If the rooms aren't in the reception wing, you are in for a shock, as you can hear all the kids screaming from the pool even when you are inside the room :(
We were shifted to some other room then which had a sewage smell when going into the balcony. Overall a very bad and tiring stay which weren't relaxing at all. 
Food is average. Dont expect anything spectacular. Although checkout is at 12 noon we were asked to leave around 1030am by a guy knocking on the door - so that they can make the room ready for the next arrival. Will avoid jetwing lighthouse at all costs on my future visits to Galle.

Spacious rooms
Direct view from room for sea view room 
Bathrooms spacious as well
Excellent food and plenty of choice at the buffet and in room dining ( quantities of portions at in room dining were plenty ) 
Beautiful views 
Large swim pools that are clean 

-Cons 
Spa wing rooms had a foul smell which I believe is from the sewage system (room #21,22,24,25)
Complained to the staff at checking in counter  which they didn’t come to check (hopefully at least after we checked out they did ) even washroom started smelling real badly after a while 
- washroom taps are a hassle as they didn’t have hot water setup indicated and three taps each on the tub as well as rainwater shower .. when you have kids it’s gonna be a problem when they meddle with all the taps naturally..
- washroom doors have NO LOCKS and I believe all the room types are same .. no privacy whatsoever if sharing a room with people 
- long walks to get to respective spa  wing rooms therefore if you’re booking this type better be mindful .

Overall good 😌 but would be extremely careful when/if booking again here with kids","Friendly staff, spacious  rooms, great food","2021-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r786504320-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The views were stunning, the room was nice and well kept, and the amenities were up to our expectations. With the exception of the horrendous condominium construction a few lands from the property which slightly spoils the natural ambience of the hotel's location/ views, we enjoyed our time in the pool and the room. 

However, the staff's lack of attentiveness was a bit disappointing. We had 4 meals at the hotel, and each time it was proven difficult to get the attention of staff to place orders for our meals and they also kept us waiting for the longest time for simple requests like a glass of water - as long as 30 mins in one occasion, and every single time we followed up with a new staff members, they disappeared into the abyss with no water served. Strange. My partner and I understood that the hotel may have had to let go of staff due to COVID, however the hotel should only occupy and accomodate numbers of guests proportionate to the number of staff members available. And this should certainly not be at the expense of the guests as we spend a considerable amount of money to get the same service we would have received had the hotel been under ordinary circumstances. The lack of staff was also evident when calling the front desk for housekeeping or general requests, and more often than not, there was nobody to answer our calls. 

Would regardless recommend the hotel for its beautiful views and a wonderful setting for a romantic stay, but doubtful if it lived up to the hype - sadly. Visit for stunning architecture and a homely feeling, and keep other expectations at a minimum.","Beautiful location!

As always, the venue is mesmeric!  However, compared with our last visit a couple of months ago, this time there were a few not so fabulous experiences that we had:
-The air conditioning was woefully inefficient in the rooms. The fact that the fan too completed a perambulation in genteel slow motion also didn’t help with the cooling.  Split units would be a much more effective option, both cost and experience wise. 
-There was an infernal noise outside the bedroom at 8am as housekeeping staff navigated their merry way across the corridor for a full 30 minutes.
-The handmade soap, although a quaintly nice touch, produced no lather and was hard as a pumice stone.
ON THE GOOD SIDE!
-Used their spa facilities for the first time.  Well trained, professional Indonesian masseuses wrought their magic on our aching legs and feet.
-The alacarte menu covered a gamut of cuisines and the food was delicious.
-The promontory seating area overlooking the ocean on the western side, as always, was the piece de resistance.  The sunset there over a cup of tea or a glass of wine is phenomenal food for the soul.  Would probably make a poet out of the most jaded amongst us!

Staff was always wearing masked and had gloves worn all the time. Temperature checking, mandatory hand washing or any other special kind of disinfecting method was not present. Staff did not ask the guests to ware masks or insisted on any kind of social distancing of any sort during the stay (hope they did it on pure purpose of not ruining guests stay (?))

Anyway, the buffet was planned as to be served by the staff, and was very admirable. Felt no different from the norm and sometimes guests served themselves. 

As a side note, it was observed that the hotel ran kinda with a limited staff given the current market conditions. This may be because some of the amenities were not present without request (tooth paste, tooth brush, slippers). The booking was for my wife's birthday and they said there was a complementary cake, but was not received :-(

Anyhow, all in all;

* Food - Good, but not great. Very little sea food present at the dinner + BBQ
* Service - Commendable
* Location and Rooms - Exceptional. Well maintained, and the private beach area (right in-front of 1st floor) was mesmerizing! Beautiful architecture.

It’s a great location for many sightseeing places including Sigiryia. The hotel was rated 4 star but it is definitely not to this standard.more a 3 star.
The positives- location, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The beds are large and comfy. The shower has a good shower head and lots of hot water. The buffet has a good selection of food and is quite good. The pool is really nice and large and clean. 

The downside- the rooms- our room was so dark inside we couldn’t see to unpack. When we tried to open the blinds we realised you couldn’t open them. The door had a dodgy lock and the key needed to be in the light switch so in an emergency you would have to take out the key and find the key hole to get out. This is pretty unsafe we felt. 
We had five hangers for all our clothes, to be fair they did provide more but seemed shocked we asked for more. 
The shower was mouldy in parts, the toilet didn’t flush properly and needed about fine attempts. The hairdryer was useless and melted around the rim. It was like it was from the 70s. The bin was rusty. 
The floor mat needed dumping it was so stained as was my pool towel. The pillows were so stained they needed replacing. We noticed this by accident and it really put us off. 
The chairs outside were so uncomfortable you couldn’t sit on them. 
The pool although nice only  had about 8-10 sunloungers for the whole hotel.

After nearly 4 hours on the road upon leaving the airport, we arrived at the hotel and were greeting by lovely staff on and shown to our room which was very outdated, dark and unfortunately home to a good many mosquitos.  The rooms did  it have enough power points. The rooms were  a duplex set up which as a couple we didn’t need, but the upper area was  where all the mozzies were waiting to come down the stairs and attack us !  Fortunately we had brought plenty of repellent and only had a bite or two.   The food was poor in my opinion.  Plenty of options but 90% was vegetarian and meat quality tough and poor. Nice soups and sweets but not enough to give it any more than an average rating.  The staff were exceptionally polite and friendly and a credit to the hotel. Some of our group were not happy as they had problems with being overcharged for wine, and not being served with what they had ordered.

Surprising we didn’t get hardly any mosquito bites considering it was raining a lot and in deep jungle/forest.
Ideal to visit caves and lion rock 
Staff fantastic

Vi beklager at høre om de udfordringer, du oplevede med renligheden på dit værelse og i restauranten. Dette lever ikke op til de høje standarder, vi sætter for os selv, og vi vil sørge for at gennemgå dine kommentarer med vores rengøringsteam for at sikre, at vores gæster altid kan forvente en upåklagelig standard.

Det er dog en fornøjelse at vide, at du nød vores udvalg af retter ved buffetten samt den varme velkomst og hjælpsomhed fra vores receptionspersonale. Vi er også glade for, at du kunne værdsætte den smukke, store pool, som er en perfekt måde at slappe af og nyde det tropiske vejr på.

Vi glæder os til, at i endnu engang vender tilbage til vores hotel som gæster.

1. The location is great and the expanse of the property is huge. It is really staying in the midst of nature 
2. Rooms are large and on paper amenities are good 
3. Breakfast and dinner buffet spreads are good, and quality is what you would expect from a 3-4* star hotel

Cons:
1. Lot of things dont work. Our toilet flush wasn't working and we had to keep calling people to fix it.
2. Even the booking was an issue, though here the blame is on Agoda. We had booked two Garden Suites. Hotel gets Agoda bookings through Booking.com and what they had was for a lower category room. They showed us the message so have to trust them. We had a problem with Agoda bookings in Nuwara Eliya as well, so something clearly messed up there. 

This is not a complaint, but just an observation as language constraints is ours. Among all the places we stayed in in Sri Lanka, it was toughest to communicate in English here.

Sadly, on our second night there, the hotel had a function which had very loud music, thumping and drumming which kept me awake and despite calling reception at just before and after midnight, nothing was done. The manager told me they had had complaints from other guests too and assured me the music would be turned down and it would be finished within 15 minutes. It was just after 1 am when the music stopped which didn’t give me much time to try and get some sleep before having to be up at 6 am.

As we were there only for 2 nights, we didn't bother complaining. 

Shower was not always hot especially in the mornings. Room was basic and needed to be upgraded. To be honest we were glad we were here only for 2 nights as rest of the hotels on our tour were excellent.

Breakfast and dinners were good and there was a large variety of food. Pool was large and enjoyed swimming on the second evening. Staff were friendly too.

We enjoyed watching the antics of the monkeys and peacocks. Our bungalow with a spacious balcony had a mezzanine floor was very dark. The blinds on the windows and doors were broken and we were unable to lift them to open and let in more light. Everything was very clean and toiletries replaced.
It is very much a transit hotel with very large groups of tourists. So the dining room was quite noisy. We thought the food only average. 
One breakfast was absolute chaos because a couple of coach loads were leaving at roughly the same time. So they all came in to the dining room together and the staff just could not cope, although they did their very best. Meanwhile four managers were in reception chatting, instead of lending a hand.
Live music was played during dinner, which was pleasant, but somewhat loud. 
Reception staff were very helpful and arranged for us to have a cake at our table as it was our wedding anniversary, which was a lovely touch.","NO ATMOSPHERE.","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r940224051-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for choosing Occidental Paradise Dambulla, A member of Barceló Hotel Group for your holiday and for sharing your honest feedback.

We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed the authentic Sri Lankan desserts at our dinner buffet and found our gym facilities to your satisfaction. It's also great to know that our hotel's location served as a convenient base for your excursions to the nearby historical sites. 
We understand that the noise from the air conditioning unit was a concern, and we are looking into quieter solutions to ensure our guests' comfort. The condition of the toilet facilities you described is certainly not up to our standards, and we have addressed this with our housekeeping team to ensure that all rooms meet our strict cleanliness criteria. Regarding the safe in your room, we apologize for any inconvenience and have reminded our staff to diligently check all room amenities as part of our service protocol. We also acknowledge your feedback on the food labelling at our buffet and are implementing clearer signage to better cater to our guests with dietary preferences. 
Thank you for acknowledging the value and service provided during your stay. We strive to offer an exceptional experience, and your insights are integral to our continuous improvement.

We hope to welcome you back.

The property itself is in a beautiful setting and is well located for excursions to the various historical sights in the area. This is a major positive. Otherwise, there were several small things which combined to undermine the experience:

1. Room air conditioners are noisy. This was not so bad as to prevent sleep but was just enough to be a nuisance. Maintenance came over when I called but they could not resolve the issue and insisted that it was normal.

2. The toilet bowls were yellowing and a little gross. This was the case in more than one room. It looked like it needed a clean with some bleach. The plastic toilet seats were also in poor condition. A small leak in the cistern meant that there was always a small puddle around the toilet in my room (#511).

3. The safe in my room was faulty. A maintenance crew came and fitted a new one. The safe in my sister's room (#503) was locked on arrival. This is an easy thing to get right and is why, at other hotels, management use checklists when rooms are reset.

4. The food labelling at the buffet was not friendly to vegetarian / vegan guests. I saw several cases of other visitors struggling to figure out which dishes contained eggs for example. This is again relatively easy to fix.

On the plus side, the gym had decent freeweights up to 25 or 30kg. The benches were horizontal-only, but this was not a major issue. Also, the dinner buffet served some authentic Sri Lankan desserts such as Watalappam and Bibikkan which were delicious.","Wasted Potential","2023-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r927435799-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your review with us.

We appreciate that you chose to stay with us, however, we are concerned to learn about the noise issues you encountered with our team and that the food quality did not meet your expectations. We strive to maintain a peaceful environment for our guests, and we will address this matter with our team to ensure better communication and professionalism.

Regarding the food, we offer a variety of dining options, including three restaurants and two bars, to cater to different tastes and preferences. We will take your feedback into account and work on improving our culinary offerings. We also want to assure you that we are committed to eco-friendly practices, and we will investigate the garbage disposal issue you mentioned.

Nevertheless, we are delighted to hear that you appreciated our wonderful location and the beauty of the surrounding rural Sri Lankan village culture. It's great to know that you enjoyed the amazing spa treatment provided by our Balinese Ayu Spa.

On the plus side, it is close to the airport and offers a complimentary shuttle service. 

On the minus side, the food isn’t great - half of the meat in my Beef Stroganoff was unchewable. 

A bit more importantly: there is an aspect of how the A/C works that is different from any if the other 10+ hotels I stayed at in Sri Lanka (or indeed any other hotel): The rooms do not have any way for the guests to adjust the temperature of the A/C themselves. Instead you have to call Housekeeping, who arrive with the one and only A/C remote control that the hotel possesses.

The hotel has poor streetscape appeal so on first arrival a guest feels they have made a poor decision however on entering the lobby and met by friendly staff it becomes more reassuring.

When he said the stay would be at Ramada, I was happy as I had stayed at ramada properties before and expected similar 4 star or 5 star treatment. We had to wait for more than 2 hours and were driven to the hotel at about 12 AM. Reaching the hotel, I was shocked to see an old building that was different from the ramada Colombo I checked online. The driver said, this was ramada kaunayake near airport. Check in was smooth and the room was very old, old cot, old furniture, bad view , cigarette smell, no AC. I was disappointed and was too tired to protest. I had not had my dinner and requested the staff to prepare any vegetarian dish which can be cooked fast. I was given fried rice at that late hour and I thank them for that service. Breakfast was elaborate and staff were friendly. One over friendly waiter asked me to take up body massage in the hotel spa by a female masseur. I gently refused and he said that the I could avail all favours from the masseur. That was quite embarrassing as the waiter was elderly. I did lose respect for him and ignored him. Lunch was also good and the restaurant was empty. They have a small pool and could not see much of any other facilities. The travel desk helped me in the closest sightseeing places but I did not take it up as they were far from the hotel and was too hot outside.

As a valued repeat guest, your satisfaction is of utmost importance to us, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused during your stay.

Following an internal investigation, we have identified that one of our front office staff members provided incorrect information regarding the happy hour discount at our restaurant. We understand how frustrating and disappointing this must have been, and we take full responsibility for this oversight. While this mistake should not have occurred, we strongly believe that the situation could have been handled better, especially by offering the discount as a goodwill gesture to acknowledge your continued patronage with us. We deeply regret that this did not happen at the time.

Additionally, we are very sorry to hear that you found the service at reception to be below the level of warmth and professionalism that you had previously enjoyed. We will be addressing this with our team immediately to ensure that all staff members are well-informed, proactive, and always ready to assist our guests with accuracy and care.

Regarding the hot water issue, we understand how essential this is for guest comfort. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and have since addressed the matter with our maintenance team to ensure that this does not happen again.

We truly appreciate your loyalty and are saddened that this experience has left you feeling disappointed. We would love the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and restore your confidence in our service. Should you reconsider visiting us again, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly so that we can personally ensure a seamless and memorable stay.

Once again, our sincere apologies, and we thank you for your valuable feedback.

Greetings from Colombo Court Hotel & Spa!

Thank you so much for your valuable feedback. 

I personally conducted an investigation on this matter and came to understand that you had arrived late to the hotel (past midnight) and not with the rest of the group. Our restaurants operate until 11 PM for dinner and this has been clearly communicated with your travel agent which I believe has failed to communicate the same to you.

With regards to breakfast, all breakfast orders were taken at the time of arrival on the day before you check-out but except for yours since you had arrived very much late in the night and our restaurants were closed. 

However, I believe that our front office staff has failed to check on this matter with the tour leader when they had arrived prior to you. They could have checked if you require dinner and on your meal preferences for breakfast. 

Ms. Rumno, I will assure you that we will take this as a learning point and will make sure that serve our guests better in the future.

The person who welcomed us at the airport was more friendly and warm compared to the staff who welcomed us upon arrival and processed our check in. Even the driver who took us to the hotel was friendlier and shared with us the nice sites to visit in Colombo. Among the 5 hotels we stayed at in Sri  Lanka (Aryana, Aliya Resort and Spa, Theva Residency and Jetwing Lagoon), we did not have the same warm welcome and departure in this hotel. 

The only saving grace in our short stay was the restaurant staff during breakfast who was warm and always smiling as well as the delicious Sri Lankan breakfast. There was only one other table occupied during breakfast as there were not too many guests after the Easter bombing. The room was also comfortable. It's also good to read about the hotel being eco-friendly.

Based on the reviews we were expecting a boutique hotel experience. This hotel is at best average. On a positive note all the staff were warm and friendly. Plus the pool area is very nice.
Room is OK but nothing special or particularly unique for the price. Red/brown stain running along the wall next to seating area easily cleaned with a cloth but obviously nobody had bothered.
World Cup soccer has just started and the hotel had added several tacky cardboard advertisements throughout. Went to enjoy their “happy hour” at the roof bar but  apparently it didn’t apply as usual because of the World Cup. No mention of the change to usual operations because of the World Cup on their website or when we arrived. More importantly why would it change because of the World Cup? As a guest from half way across the world I didn’t come to a “boutique” hotel in Colombo to view, hear or have anything to do with the World Cup. A national Sri Lankan holiday or even a significant western one (eg Xmas , NYE) is an understandable reason to change normal offers but a football tournament in Russia.....Really? Got the discount in the end after insisting but soured the experience.
Then asked at reception about airport transfer, quoted a price I thought was too high which is fair enough and common at hotels. So asked for normal taxis and was given a phone number to call myself and book a taxi. What?? Have travelled extensively around the world and never received such a response, if a guest wants transport arranged any decent hotel will assist even if you refuse to use their specific vehicles. Of course try to sell me your hotel service but when I say no and ask for an alternative then tell me you will call and book on our behalf a standard taxi or find us a taxi at the time required, don’t just had me a phone number to call myself. That’s not how hotels and particularly boutique hotels look after their guests. Disappointed that our last night in Sri Lanka was at this hotel and would not recommend, for the price paid I’m sure there are better hotels in Colombo.

This is how we paid approx 220$ for a “superior“ double room in the Columbo Court Hotel. This hotel is located very conveniantely in a central location which -naturally- is also noisy. Hence the rooms are oriented inwards but not only to a courtyard (as one might assume given the name) but also towards light shafts doubling up as locations for air condition equipment. These shafts provide obviously no view and little daylight and most unfortunately act as amplifiers for the noise emitted by the technical equipment and all activities that are happening on an open ground floor (from kitchen cleaning, to Bar music and party chatter). The rooms themselves are ok in size and clean, if not particularly pretty or well illuminated (day or night). 

Given this situation we already felt slightly irritated, but were really annoyed when it came to breakfast (which was included in the price). It was served in a tired looking restaurant by a large quantity of waiters who mostly seemed to watch that you would pay once you deviated from the prescribed route of “English breakfast”. Top of the list was “fruit platter” that consisted of a few tiny pieces of Watermelon, papaya and banana on a huge plate. Mango (delicious and in season) was not available and more banana cost extra. After this we asked the hotel to book a taxi for us, which they refused to do lest we would use the hotel’s own service. By now we were really enraged and demanded to speak to the manager whom we met in the evening. The perfectly nice young Pole explained that he had arrived only two weeks ago and was given the task to give the place a lift. Well, he has a task at his hand. He was very apologetic and promised imminent improvement of which future travellers may benefit. We were leaving early the next morning and were given a special fruit breakfast in the foyer. Even a mango was delivered after a repeated request into the rolling taxi. A second view into booking.com on the next day showed our room on offer for 89$ in the coming days, which - I would say- is a fair price. So if you want a bargain stay in a hotel that is trying harder, this might be your place in the next year or so; We, however, will probably try somewhere else when returning to Colombo.....","Rip-off Artists (no more?)","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r561056904-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The CC is quite OK, clean and with all amenities as advertised. But, be careful what room you end up with. Our room looked out onto a walk way....conversely, everyone on the walk way looked into our room, unless the blinds were tightly shuttered making the room very dark and grim.  The other aspect was that all of the noise from any functions and a kitchen area also drifted up to us.  On our first night, the function noise died down around midnight following two calls to complain.  It s a hotel after all, not a night club.
Having had a whinge, the wifi worked well and the breakfast was excellent.  The service was willing and able.  Probably would not stay here again, but still early into my SL trip.

First impression was great and the staff were excellent.  Rooms are clean and well kept.  There was a few issues with the internet and the shower pressure was cold one second and boiling the next.  There is also no window on the bathroom (it is screened and private) however you can hear the next door bathroom which is quite disturbing.  The biggest let down was the food.  It was average at best.  Breakfast I ordered the English breakfast.  The fruit platter had fruit that tasted like it had been cut 2 days ago, I had poached eggs the first time and it was served on hard toast and an omelet the next day which was ok but the cheese they used was processed.  We also had lunch when we arrived and we ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  It arrived as a sandwich with bacon and processed cheese.  They did apologize and didn't charge us however it was really unacceptable to just blame the chef.  In a country that has such amazing fresh fruit and good it was disappointing.","Good Hotel and location","2017-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r502134161-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review. I am pleased that you enjoyed our team's hospitality, food and our central location.

Strategically located if you are in look out for tuk tuks.  
Loved the hotel, smiling staff, food not only delicious but well presented.  My only grudge was the room, I stayed in 201 and traffic noise was a menace.  Wooden blinds were used as curtains which nicely let in all the streetlights at night, so could not get much sleep to top it all I had back to back meetings, my bad!
