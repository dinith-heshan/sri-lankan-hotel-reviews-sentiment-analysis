It was a nice stay but an underwhelming experience after the big build up in the promotional videos. 

On the positives 

The property is very pretty with an old world colonial bungalow set in a beautiful  English styled garden with stunning views of  the lake

The service was excellent and the staff are wonderful and go out of their way as they do in all the hotels we have stayed in of Sri Lanka 

The food was good - we had some delicious meals cooked by Chef Ravi but also some average ones when he went on leave

On the downside 

The property is difficult to reach and if you don’t fly in via a chartered  seaplane  it takes ages ( in our case 6 hours from Ulagalla and then an hours wait for the boat transfer as it was doing a picnic cruise ). It also makes it a very long journey if you want to visit any of the neighbouring attractions.

The hiking trails are nice but very steep in places. They pass through many villages housing and unfortunately can have quite some trash lying around. 

There is not too much to do at the hotel and there is a very limited variety of flora or fauna or bird life compared to Ulagalla and other parts of srilanka given all the forests have been cleared to grow tea

Most disappointing for us was the “luxury” room in castlereagh which we were assigned instead of the garden suite we had booked. This was due to a misunderstanding as our preferred room  wasn’t available on the  first day. The luxury room has no privacy with gardeners staff and guests constantly passing within a few feet of the window and the room is dark and stuffy if you draw the blinds. It also has no access to the garden which is half the charm in the hills. 

The hotel appears  to  cater to people who enjoy or want to relive the experience  of the old colonial lifestyle - butler’s and staff waiting on you , call bells in the room to summon staff, butlers who bring you tea in bed in the morning … 

I am sure that’s fine for  some,   but was not our cup of tea.  

We preferred our stay in Ulagalla which was equally if not more luxurious, very beautiful with a variety of flora and fauna and just felt more authentically Sri Lankan with excellent service, delicious food and the wonderful hospitality that this beautiful country has to offer","Very pretty but underwhelmed","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r939941315-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

Our second visit to Tea Trails and Castlereagh Bungalow, some aspects of which are sublime luxury.  The location, on the Dilmah Tea Plantation, the grounds, the accommodation, general ambience and the cuisine are all 5*.  The outstanding chef, Samantha, and the superb waiting staff skilfully led by Ajith, make the dining experience something special.  However, we experienced 2 very negatives features.  Having reserved the Palmer Garden suite for its private garden and summerhouse, we were appalled to find that a gang of men were sawing up a tree (by hand!) adjacent to our suite (actually in the staff quarters!).  The noise and disturbance were awful.  We complained to the Butler who said he would ‘sort it’.  He did not and it continued until dark.  The following morning before 7.00 am it started again and then another, even larger, tree was felled, very narrowly missing the summerhouse where we were sitting and showering everything with dust and debris – potentially very dangerous and extremely frightening!  We eventually ‘erupted’ at 2.00pm and Ajith was able to stop the disturbance which the ineffectual Butler could not.  An expensive day plus was totally ruined!  Also, we were told by our driver that it was no longer possible to drive to the bungalow as the road was so bad and that we would have to travel by boat from another Bungalow.  OK, but for the fact that the steep access on both sides was very slippery and uneven.  If the hotel wants guests, it needs to sort access or else warn guests of the problem beforehand, so that they can wear suitable footwear.  Not at all good!

I don't think the comparison with regular hotels is fair. We are not a “5 star” hotel - we do not compete in that mainstream category, hotels you mention have 100+ rooms and is what many of our guests seek to escape from. 

The focus is on service and I am glad that you acknowledge this is superior. The rooms deliberately don’t have TVs, minibar and conventional hotel amenities as we do not seek to be a conventional hotel. Instead we have a butler call bell, scenery and hopefully conversation!  

Tea Trails seeks to offer a boutique experience fully inclusive of gourmet meals, all beverages, laundry, the tea experience and pretty much anything that a guest would ask for. At a regular ""bed & breakfast hotel"" these ""extras"" can exceed the room rate. The range of premium spirits include malt whiskeys but since this is served off a butler trolley we don't have a 50ft bar as a large hotel may.  Our food is highly rated and our chefs are fully equipped as attested by guest feedback over the years. We do not offer massive buffets, everything is a la carte, made to order.  

My apologies about the most unusual weather in August, something obviously beyond our control but nevertheless I fully understand your frustration and how it may have impacted your stay at Tea Trails. We are seeing weather extremes in many parts of the world and Kerala in neighbouring India has been devastated by floods - we have been subject to the same unseasonal weather pattern which is now clearing.  

None of the three resorts in the Resplendent Ceylon collection exceed 40 rooms and our new developments will follow a similar course - original resorts offering a “non-hotel” experience.  Once again, my apologies that we disappointed you.

When rating the experience at Tea Trails the price must be the point of departure. We paid USD 1015 for each night (they also had rooms twice the price of that). In comparison we paid approx USD 350 per night at VERY good 5-star hotels in Tangalle (Anantara) and Sigiriya (Jetwing). Tea Trails was 3 times that price, i.e. USD 650 more per night. Can this price difference be justified? We think clearly not:

1. Service: To be fair, the service was really good. You get a lot of attention. This was better than other 5-stars hotels.

2. Rooms: Nothing you would not expect from any 5-star hotel. In fact, the rooms did not have TVs and no minibar, and also lacked other amenities you would expect to get in a 5-star hotel.

3. Breakfast: Nothing you would not expect from and receive at any 5-star hotel, inclusive in the rate.

4. Lunch, afternoon tea and dinner: This was inclusive in the price. Except from free laundry cleaning and free bar this, however, was the only thing which you would have paid for at a regular 5-star hotel, but which was included in the rate at Tea Trails. The food was good, but not that impressive really. We had much better food at the restaurants at other 5-star hotels. So the food inclusive in the rate clearly cannot justify the extra USD 650 per night.

5. Wine: they served cheap red wine, you could choose between 3 types (2 of them with screw caps). This was truly disappointing. The second night we wanted to buy a wine from the menue, but it turned out that they did not have ANY of the red wines on the list. In a 3-star hotel that would be entirely fine. But not in a 5-star hotel charging USD 1015 per night.

6. Drinks: all drinks were free, but they did not have a huge selection. And let’s be realistic: how many drinks can you really have each day?

7. Laundry: This was for free. Very good service. But clearly this add-on cannot justify the price.

8. Activities: Nothing you would not expect from any 5-star hotel. The best activities you had to pay for.

9. Shared areas: Consist of a rather small living room, a garden and a pool. The shared areas are clearly much better at a regular 5-star hotel.

10. Concept: Tea Trails have 5 bungalows, but they are quite far apart. Hence, most of the time (if not all) you will stay in your bungalow, which have 5 rooms. The space feels somewhat limited. Also, each bungalow has its own kitchen and chef. Probably, this explains why the food was not that excellent. Indeed, it will be difficult for such a small hotell to have 5 state-of-the-art kitchens and chefs.

11. Climate: It was raining a lot, all of the time we were at Tea Trails. We have the impression that this is often the case, except from December to March. Hence, you are well advisded to check the climate for the period you will stay at Tea Trails before booking.

All in all: had it been a regular 5-star hotel with regular 5-star hotel prices we would have been very happy. Even if the price had been USD 500 per night, that would have been fine. USD 1015, however, is outreagous. Unless you get a massive discount on the price, I would only recommend Tea Trails to extremely rich people that do not at all care about the price (who, however, surely can find something better elsewhere).

On the positive side:
- Great location, nice views and very friendly and helpful staff.
- Great concept to be able to have a meal at the other bungalows
- Nice to be able to cycle and kayak between the bungalows (at this price point, the kayaking should be included)
- Very tasty food, especially the local curries, nicely presented. I liked the desserts too.
- Nice walking routes, although short distances
- It is nice to see how the tea factory is set up and the mission to help provide better circumstances of living for the working people

A few critical remarks:
- Surprisingly there's no white tea served for the afternoon tea. When asked, it was said it is not an option to serve this.
- How the concept works is not well (at all) explained, but this could as well be due to our arrival time after 11pm.
- Although the meal options are discussed every day with the cook, they try to steer into the same direction/courses for all the guests. They seemed surprised at our request to mainly eat local dishes instead of the Western dishes they often recommended, like risotto, pasta, etc. The vegetarian pasta is not so interesting
- We met the general manager only in one of the bungalows where we stayed.
- The staff seems to be trained minimally and is not used to offering the services you'd expect at this price point/luxury standard this hotel tries to be. You have to ask for a lot of things, which are happily provided, but the staff seems a bit shy. Surprisingly, they did offer to clean and dry our shoes are a muddy/rainy walk.

If you decide to go: carefully check which bungalow to book yourself into. The locations and scenery vary quite a bit. You can find enough information about this online.

We were picked up by car at the Colombo airport, but travelled back by train, departing in Hatton and staying overnight (for two nights) in Kandy before continuing to Colombo. This works very well and was quite an experience. We ran into a staff member at the train station who was asked to assist us there on his day off. Very kind!

We are both vegetarians and don't drink alcohol, so not sure whether I would stay here again at this all inclusive rate for meals and all drinks.

The property is beautifully located on a lake surrounded by tea plantations. Staff are very helpful and service is fantastic. Food is very good. All staff were trying hard to make our stay enjoyable and full marks to all of them.

What makes this property 4 star instead of 5 is the accommodation. The common area, ie lounge/dining room and terrace have no ceiling fans. This maybe authentic but applying 1850 standards in the 21st century is a bit of a stretch. There is hardly any wind in the evenings and it was consistently uncomfortable, stuffy and suffocating in these areas taking away from the ambiance. And yes it is cooler in the mountains but still warm indeed and a ceiling fan should be a minimum requirement. 

The rooms are equally below par. Tea Trails define them as luxury rustic giving a new meaning to the word. The furniture is old, worn out, very basic and uninteresting in a dark room. The mattresses are Spartan and of course there is no television. There was no ceiling fan in our sitting room (thus warm) although our bedroom had one. Problem is there is hardly any draught in the rooms making them stuffy and uncomfortable.  

Accepting management's advertising that no airconditioning was needed we expected all would be ""cool"". The result for us was an uncomfortable restless sleep tossing and turning and the conclusion that the mountain ""coolness"" was not working for us. Surely luxury accommodation purported to be close to 5 star like the Tea Trails should give customers the choice to select their own ""coolness"" standards rather than one dictated by management. The lack of airconditioning in the bedrooms is painful and for us a deal-breaker....

All in all an unique experience, great staff in 4 star accommodation.","4 Star accomodation; staff trying hard.","2016-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r358025209-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

I am glad that you enjoyed the service, dining and location at Ceylon Tea Trails.

I sincerely apologize for the issue with brown coloured water in your bath. We experienced torrential rains, which even caused major landslides in some areas and our main water line was damaged. I am extremely sorry about the inconvenience caused, the issue has been rectified after it was brought to our attention by you.

The bungalows do indeed attempt to recreate the ambiance of a working estate bungalow. We will weed out the out of place items that have crept in. There is no excuse for the tear in the window screen and gap under the door. This will be addressed immediately.

Our apologies once again and thank you for your constructive comments.

What we found was a unique accommodation experience that lived up to its reputation and superb reviews for world-class service and dining amid a splendid setting high up in the plantations. 

Many luxury hotels these days make noise about their personalised service and ‘butlers’, but Ceylon Tea Trails lives up to the marketing. We stayed in the Tientsin bungalow, and we were treated by highly attentive service from the staff who made us feel welcome and sought to respond to all of our requests. 

Even beyond the service staff on the ground, I found an impressive culture of service while dealing with reservations. I made inquiries about purchasing teas ahead of our visit and the manager I was e-mailing suggested that they could send up any teas that I want up to the bungalow all the way from Colombo should I wish. There is definitely a personalised attentiveness here and impressive desire to please. There is no question that this is top-notch, 5-star service and we had absolutely no complaints in this area. 

A special feature of Tea Trails is its focus on fine dining. Full-board meals are included in all rates and we were treated to amazing, delicious, world-class cuisine for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. Indeed, the biggest problem at Tea Trails is learning to say no as it is far too easy and tempting to over-indulge! The meals are mostly European/Continental, but you can also have delicious Sri Lankan cuisines as well (best daal I’ve ever had!). Seriously, we’ve never eaten as well over several days at any point in our lives. 

The bungalows are all located apart from one another and generally require a car service or a long bike ride to visit the others. Tientsin is the highest in altitude of the four, surrounded by working tea plantations. It was a special experience to stay in this historic old villa amid this beautiful location. Tientsin also includes a nice new pool (though we didn’t use as it was a bit rainy and cool during our stay). 

Activities include walking trails in the plantations, mountain biking and a complimentary tea factory tour. 

The one area which unfortunately did not live up to our expectations though was the fit and finish of the room, which was closer to rustic than luxury, as advertised on the website- it certainly was not 5-star nor in line with the high quality of the dining and the service. I understand that the management is going for the authenticity of a working plantation bungalow, but somehow I just don’t feel that they were able to capture the right balance between this and ensuring a high quality fit and finish. The screens for the windows were poorly installed and had tears, much of the furniture was not authentic to the period of the bungalow’s construction and included bric-a-brac such as an out of place shag carpet, modernist loveseat and 1970’s-era lamps. The bathroom door also had a large 2-3 inch gap at the bottom which limited the privacy of the toilet. What was especially disappointing was that for one night there was only luke warm water for the bath and for another night the bathwater came out brown (no exaggeration). We mentioned this to the staff and they tried to fix it, but it still came out slightly brown the next day. Considering how much the hotel makes of its morning bath service, It was very unfortunate that we couldn’t truly enjoy the large claw-footed bathtub and it just seemed to reflect a lack of focus on the physical quality of the room. 

All in all, we liked Tea Trails but just could not understand the divergence between the amazing service and dining and the rustic, lower quality room. If they can really nail the room by bringing it up to true 5-star standards, this could easily be a world-beating hotel property.","Top Notch Service, Dining and Setting at this Unique Property, Too Bad About The Room","2014-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r241665981-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

We stayed there fro 5 nights in all with 2 nights at Norwood and 3 nights at Castlereagh.

We were promptly picked up from our other Hotel in Colombo and drove through a scenic drive through the mountains to arrive just afternoon. The first big disappointment was the Jeffrey suite, which was small with a rest-room like long corridor. The room had no views with the door opening in the verandah having the views blocked by a barricade. This barricade was apparently created following feedback received from other guests of lack of privacy due to constant movement of staff carrying foods and drinks to the new restaurant.  Whilst the barricade has cut down the disturbance it makes the room look dull and boring. This was the only bad side of staying at Norwood. The best part was the sumptuous food served by the executive chef who was attentive and paid a lot of attention to detail to serve food that hit all the right notes on our pallet. The staff at Norwood were always proactive to all our needs before we had to ask. This set up very high expectations for the remainder of our stay at the other Bungalow. The views from Norwood give you a 360 degree view of the mountains and the Tea estates. We are aware that Norwood is undergoing a renovation this week to fix few of the issues that were noted with regards to the lack of views from Jeffrey room and the suggestion would be to avoid this room till it gets fixed. 

We moved to Castlereigh on the 3rd night and checked into the Tate Suite which had excellent lake views. But unfortunately that is where the good things at Castlereagh ended. The high expectations on service we had noted at Norwood was totally missing. The Chef at Castlereagh is under confident.  Second serving requested of any curry or dish would result in either  the gravy becoming too watery or too much salt being added. The staff at Norwood would ensure we would be served with accompaniments for the meals however at Castlereigh we would only get what we ordered. The chef did improve towards the end of the trip with a good Sphagetti. The presence of the hotel assistant manager seemed to have pushed the staff to perform better on the last night. The property has an excellent pool with scenic views.

We also used their guide services for the Adam's peak hike. The pick-up vehicle sent was an older model van with a poor aircon and bad shocks which made our hour long drive to the mountain a bumpy and uncomfortable experience. Our guide Vasan was a gem of a person, totally hands on and professional. He went out of the way to assist us during the difficult climb up the mountain. We would advise against doing this hike unless the purpose of your stay is not relaxation. Utter waste of time.

We did a 2 hour Tea Experience tour with their onsite planter Andrew. It was fun to understand the processes involved in Tea making and tasting, however the tour was a too long and should have ideally included a walk through a tea plantation with the plucker's rather than 2 hours within the noisy factory. Again the vehicle given for the drive to the tea experience was an older model van. Please ensure you ask for a proper new vehicle to avoid the uncomfortable journey.

The massage service at Tea Trails are expensive and average at best. Wouldn't recommend. 

To sum it up, despite a few hiccups we would definitely recommend Tea Trails for the breath taking views and some amazing food from the executive chef at Norwood+. A few blemishes else I would gladly rate in 5 star.","Pride and Prejudice","2014-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r205520979-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

But in March, the month when the Hindu workers on tea estates have their annual pooja (worship), there was a new priest at the Temple who was pandering to the local community and had increased the sound levels, which caught us by surprise.

The look and feel of the bungalow was ideal. The views of the surrounding area was superb, with tea plantations stretching for miles over the mountains and hillsides.
The food was excellent, the all-inclusive really all-inclusive and the level of customer service exceptional. Everything was perfect in every way except for one issue. 
The bungalow sits right above a small village and right below a hindu temple. From morning to evening the temple would blare music that could be heard even from the inside of our room. The village was also noisy, but not on such a regular basis. Still there was some moments when one could enjoy a stereo effect of hindu music…so much for peace of mind.
The owner of Tea trails answered to a similar post about noise in December that “We attempted to tone down the sound but the results were limited”. I believe that the gentleman has been much influenced by British understatement culture, as I cannot imagine that there has been any perceivable result. In the same answer he also said that “Tientsin is usually tranquil”, which I have difficulties to evaluate, as someone had this problem in December and we in March.
So I give 3 stars for Tientsin, which is a shame. A mean between 5 stars for the bungalow and all its fantastic achievements, and one star for the aggressive, disturbing, noisy environment that will probably keep me from coming back to a place that could be top level world class.","Try to avoid hindu festival times","2013-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r158017965-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

The look and feel of the bungalow was ideal.  The views of the surrounding area was magnificent, with tea plantations stretching for miles over the mountains and hillsides.  You can sit on the veranda and watch the ladies picking the tea.  A visit to the tea factory; a highlight of our stay to be sure.  Andrew gives a fun and informative tour and we learned much about the tea business.

We fell ill during our stay.  We felt the hotel staff's concern was genuine and they went to great lengths to make sure we had a doctor's house call and all the warm soup we needed.   In sickness and in health, the staff doted on us and made us feel very special.  Clearly management of Tea Trails sets high expectations for their staff and in our experience, the staff achieves the highest level of customer service standards.   

Everything was perfect in every way except for one issue.  I have considered omitting this comment because the bungalow is so appealing and the staff were wonderful.  However, I want to be honest in my opinion and especially due to the cost of the stay.  I wish I would have known in advance that the location is not serene. It seems it should be tranquil.  And one longs for it to be quiet, but it just is not.  The bungalow sits right above a small village.  And throughout the day and evening a speaker system would randomly blare music which echos right up into the bungalow.  Loud booms also go off every now and again, as if fireworks were being set off.  This went on each night we were there until after midnight.  I understand that the hotel as no control over the noise pollution of the surrounding area.  But the loud speakers, road traffic with horns honking, late night booming and feral dogs fighting in the night were disruptive to my enjoyment.  Tiensin's serenity, sadly, is affected greatly by the surroundings.

If I were to make the trip again, I will inquire to find out of one of the other bungalows might be more quiet.  And for this point alone, I would not make a return trip to Tiensin, which is otherwise completely lovely bungalow with it's outstanding staff.","Tiensin bungalow mixed experience","2012-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r148492471-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

With gourmet meals and drinks (including spirits and wines) included, I believe you would be hard pressed to find better value.

Having gone into details of your stay, I understand you were unhappy with the costs of a taxi from Tea Trails to Galle and white water rafting on your way down from Tea Trails. Both requests were made only on arrival at Tea Trails, and we helped arrange with third parties. The butler spent several hours making arrangements. We advised you against hiring a local taxi for a 6 hour drive, due to safety concerns but bowed to your insistence that it was cheaper than our usual service provider and that you were on a tight budget.

Both the white water rafting company and the taxi later complained to us that you had short paid them.

Considering our isolated location, which is a key part of Tea Trails's attraction, it is critical that travel arrangements are made in advance. If you do choose to visit us again, we are always happy to help plan your trip to and from Tea Trails so that there are no surprises.

The 2 miles journey from Kandy is rather  slow and a bit tortuous with the poor winding road but we had an excellent welcome at the hotel. It is situated high in the hills with glorious views from the restaurant/terrace. It was lunchtime and we had a drink and an excellent lunch. After lunch we went to the pool and we’re disappointed that the sun had gone round by 4pm so we went to our excellent lovely room with a sheltered courtyard which had plenty of sun. My evening meal was very good but my wife’s was a disaster. We asked for a simple piece of fish on the basis that it should have been a safe choice . However because guests are required to pre order a few hours in advance they didn’t have available fish available to offer and insisted my wife had a steak which came massively rare. By thus time she was past eating anything so not a great evening ! This was compounded by the very limited wine choice and the Cabernet Sauvignon we ordered which was very cheap and pretty dreadful.

First the positives. The location is stunning about 35 minutes above Kandy with lovely views to the Knuckles and a quiet location. The bungalow is a lovely building with 9 rooms and very nicely laid out common areas. Dining is on a very nice veranda with an excellent view across the valley.

The bedroom was very large and very well appointed. A very large and comfortable bed, plenty of storage and very good aircon.

The bathroom was nicely appointed with an excellent shower, good pressure hot water and plenty of towels.

Housekeeping was excellent and the place was spotless. 

But there are problems. First we had a problem with a major flood of our bathroom on our first morning when a valve apparently failed. It was sorted out promptly while we were out but it wasn't great paddling around in litres of hot water. And no one in authority ever said sorry.

Second the food. We found it indifferent. The western breakfasts reminded us (for British readers) of Little Chef bordering on the unpleasant. Dinners were simply dull ranging across a range of cuisines.

The service was chaotic. Orders for drinks were forgotten, food took an age to arrive despite being asked to specify dinner times in advance. There seemed to be no one in charge to make sure that serving staff, some of whom were very pleasant,  were coordinated and looking after guests in a timely manner. Worryingly the one competent member of the service team was leaving.

A range of guest activities are offered. We enjoyed one excellent long hike but a booking for an afternoon/evening nature walk was simply forgotten and the alternative offered was a poor experience.

We were annoyed to be woken up one morning by another guest's child playing the grand piano in the main lounge loudly and badly at 6.30am. No action was be taken to stop this.

We stayed 4 nights. I found it very odd that I kept being asked by various members of staff on days 2 and 3 if I was leaving the next day. Surely they should have some system so that everyone knows how long guests are staying. On the receiving end it just felt a bit rude.

None of this should be difficult to fix needing some decent and visible on site management. What is deeply annoying is that this is probably the most expensive hotel in the area. They need to do much better at this price.","A very mixed bag","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r937457189-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Reservation - The person (think his name was Udith) who helped with the reservation was excellent and even organized our transport. He made sure we were picked and dropped on time and was extremely responsive and accommodative. He was on leave on the days we were at Hanthana but he always responded via whatsap and even took all our calls.

Once we arrived though I couldn’t help but feel things were not running smoothly. To start off with we didn’t know where to check in from. There were no staff in sight to welcome us leave alone tell us what the check in process was. Once our driver went in to inquire we were greeted by our own butler. 

We were escorted to our suite fairly quickly. The room itself was lovely and cosy. It had all the luxurious amenities and we were quite content. 

Menu - We thought the menu was quite
limited and just not exciting during our stay. While some meals were good, others were average. Not what you expect from a luxurious space like W15. Pls visit places such as Ulagalla/ Wallauwa/ Thotalagala to gauge the kind of food we expected. 
Food also took quite long. One morning we sat around waiting for more than 15 minutes for a menu to be brought (This is after informing our butler the night before our choices for breakfast) The butler was missing and so was our breakfast. None of the other staff even knew and it was all sort of an utter mess. 

Safari - This was something we really enjoyed and our guide was good and seemed quite knowledgeable. We booked the safari for 11am (again the booking was done the day before) but 10 minutes before he tells us he can’t do it at 11 as he had another group and he can only take us at 12pm. We rushed through the late breakfast we were served, planned
our day around doing the safari at 11 and were honestly quite annoyed we had to change plans. In order to not stress the staff out we complied but I did call the front office person who took our reservation and complained. 
He immediately said he would look in to it and from there onwards we were given better service. 
There were only 2 service staff members (Thusitha and Rohan) catering to all the guests and the bungalow was quite short staffed. Thusitha and Rohan however tried their best to accommodate all requests but it was not humanly possible to not fall short. We honestly felt bad for them as they were like 2 headless chickens running around. 

W15 lacked good management and quality of service. There seemed to be a huge disconnect between staff, communication and guest expectations.

Some monkeys in the trees and peacocks on the grass. It feels really peaceful and luxurious. 

On arrival you get welcome music and dance which was great. Check-in was fine but you immediately feel that the focus is on making more money. They try to sell you upgrades right away. The rooms are beautiful the only downside is that our room had a unpleasant smell from the high humidity. We were disappointed in the sea view it should have said restricted sea view on the website. We were on the middle floor.  Our room was cleaned daily by Prasanna who did an outstanding job. 

The breakfast was amazing. So much choice. Lots of fruit smoothies and freshly baked dosa and hoppers. The staff at breakfast were really friendly and client oriented. Special thanks to Ranil who went out of his way to make our breakfast and tea experience the best. The other food was OK. We had much better food during our time in Sri Lanka. They have lots of Asian dishes but they are quite western focus and not as authentic and/ or outspoken as we used to.  That said there was always a lot of choice and it tasted OK. 
The beach and pool are great. The sea is a quite wild in front of the hotel but if you like the sea a 2min walk to the next beach for a swim is a good option. 

We had a few room hosts during our stay in Sri Lanka and they were wonderful so we thought it would be similar in Anantara but unfortunately that was not the case. Our room host was not always professional in her answers and she was very slow to respond. Everything we asked was a NO or in some case she just gave us the wrong answer like when we booked the restaurant at 6:30 but they open at 7:00 so we went back to the room again to wait another 30min.  After a few days we did not want to contact her anymore so we just called the mainline if we needed something (much faster, more pleasant and professional). I think if we had a different room host our experience would have been much better overall.","Beautiful Hotel but not everything 5* service","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1016462979-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The standout excellence are the staff, who are all absolutely superb, combining professionalism, competence and friendliness.  We also received an unexpected and beautiful room upgrade on arrival, which was much appreciated. So why only three stars when many people give five?  We opted to upgrade to “all inclusive”; as even a small bottle of water was $6 ands a cocktail $20 and only buffet dining is included as standard, so this seemed to make sense.  Even though we were on their “premium all inclusive” (with negligible differences from the standard) package it was penny-pinching and filled with mind-numbing exclusions and rules.  Shortened menus, almost all drinks excluded (local spirits only allowed) and time restrictions meant the package was anything but all inclusive.  Couple that with the fact that wines available were the ones normally seen on discount in the local convenience store and not what you expect from Anantara, left a very bad impression.  In recent years we have generally used all-inclusive packages and never experienced this level of meanness.  When we complained they simply reassured us that these were the rules and that now we could include Gordons gin. Interestingly, across a six day stay, we never saw any senior management or saw any management interaction with other guests, marking the Anantara out from all other hotels at which we have stayed. A final observation – the hotel has a very “international” feel, as though one has left Sri Lanka behind at the gates, something that can be considered positive or negative depending on what one is looking for.","Not expected from an Anantara","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r994367568-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

You can swim in the sea if you don’t go too far",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The location of the Anantara Peace Haven is its best asset. Its second best asset is its warm and friendly team.

Beyond this, Anantara Peace Haven is a mixed bag. There are some really nice things but there’s also some corporate brand decisions which jar, some good quality materials and construction but also some poor design. 

Anantara is the creation of Minor Hotels, a Thai-based organisation that opened its first hotel in 2001. Anantara is Sanskrit for “without end.” 

It is therefore a pretty new brand and has recently expanded into Europe with city hotels and a few resorts. 

The Peace Haven hotel was built in 2015. With Covid keeping it closed between 2020 and 2022 and the economic crisis suffered in Sri Lanka, it has therefore probably only had four proper operational years since opening, so it is also pretty new. Worth mentioning that the Amanwella down the road opened in 2005, some ten years before the Peace Haven was built.

The gardens of the hotel are lovely and extremely well maintained. Rows of naturally growing palms, green, well-watered grass, plump bushes and beautiful flowers here and there. So lovely that a multitude of birds, including crying peacocks, can be heard day and night throughout, which is one of the genuine luxuries of the place. 

It is also set far back from the road on a long private drive, unlike Amanwella, and this gives Peace Haven a wonderfully private feel. 

The hotel has rooms and villas. As I was on my own, a villa would have been silly, so I was in the main hotel block (room 431). You access the hotel block from the gardens behind it. The stairwells have a disturbing multi-storey car park feel and the lifts are absolutely awful. I took the stairs every time. 

The room I had was an Ocean View Deluxe, a corner room with a decent balcony and a view of the sea through the palms. You could hear the violent waves crash throughout the night with the doors ajar, which was wonderful. 

The bed is comfortable. The linens are fairly good quality. The furniture is relatively characterful for a large property, the best pieces being the bits of rattan here and there. The ceiling fan is a nice touch as the AC isn’t the quietest.

The bathroom has a privacy screen that rises to allow more natural light from the room into the space. However, it is impossible to have any main lights on in the bathroom without the toilet extractor fan being on as well - bad design, making for a noisy experience every time you use it, whether you are using the toilet or not. 

There are no hand towels next to the sink, which is inconvenient. 

The hairdryer cord is tightly wound and not long enough to allow you to use it easily in front of a mirror without pulling the plug from the socket. 

The restaurants in the hotel include a buffet place, Journeys (who thinks of these awful names?) which is the default for breakfast and a choice for other meals and those on all inclusive packages. Personally, I believe that any hotel offering a buffet beyond breakfast is not a genuine luxury establishment. 

The other restaurants include Verala, a pan-Asian restaurant with sushi, teppanyaki and Sri Lanka curries and Il Mare, an Italian restaurant with everything that suggests - antipasti, pasta, pizza. There’s a bar just after the lobby which is a bit of a nothing space and as it is where you do the check in process, never ever quite feels like a bar space. 

El Vino is a private dining space, which doesn’t look like it is used that much, and its name sounds like a cheap wine bar in Surbiton.

These restaurants are heavily themed and branded, much like a cruise ship, which detracts from the natural beauty you are surrounded by. 

Food quality is good at breakfast, with a large spread of European, English and Sri Lankan choices. I never had lunch at the hotel but did eat at Verala on one occasion. It was quiet as many were on the all-inclusive package at Journeys. I had some sushi, which was decent and a very messy Mud Crab curry, which was a Sri Lankan dish but not the highlight. The tinned music was a disappointment, cheap Muzak (think Chinese instrument versions of “Danny Boy”). 

Cocktails here are not very well made. They are adequate but not good enough for the $15 you pay. Ropewalk in Galle Fort is one of the top bars in Sri Lanka and their cocktails run at about $11. Mixology training is needed in many hotels in Sri Lanka, as they seem intent on putting ice cubes in a Dry Martini. 

The pool is a disaster I didn’t go near. It’s attractively placed and well designed but rammed with families so there is absolutely no peace. Instead, I opted to go for the furthest loungers on the beach, which was wonderful when you want to have a moment with a book. 

The sea is very rough and they advise not to swim in it - there’s a red flag every single day - but it’s not terrible if you time your entry and re entry properly. It’s actually very refreshing and thrilling at the same time. 

The gym is adequate but for a hotel this size, very small and I was lucky that most fellow guests wanted to lie in during the early mornings. 

The staff are wonderful. Smiling, helpful, thoughtful. They’ve been through a lot in the past four years and it doesn’t even show. Resilience is a great quality. 

Fellow guests are a mix of older couples - more the suburban crowd than metropolitans - and families with young children. There was a smattering of honeymooners too.

Would I go back? Maybe. For the palms, the beach and the staff. Wouldn’t be too excited to dine here again though.

I had a host I never saw who sent me everything by WhatsApp - daily activities, menus etc. He did manage to get ice sent to my room a couple of times so it is a useful service but he was too busy to ever meet me so I’m not sure what the point of him was.","A beautiful natural space polluted by poor branding","2024-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r935068457-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The location and nature is very special indeed, based around a perfectly formed beach.
The long standing waiters and  pool area and Beach staff are beyond excellent 
and nothing is a problem, chef Singh, Suresh, Ranil and Gresham to name just a few!
From the first night we had requested the noisy generator of the villa be turned off during the evening period for a peaceful sleep. this simple request was clearly an issue for the 4 different butlers over the 2.5 week period - via WhatsApp and was not carried out efficiently despite many repeated requests! and having managers asking on a daily basis if our stay was comfortable ?
We have just returned to find a email on 1st March from the resort manager - based in Maldives, to say that due to this complaint we are to be 'blacklisted' and no longer welcome at the hotel, to say that we are shocked at the conduct and insensitivity of their actions would be understated !
 we are hugely offended by this and clearly would choose never to revisit or direct family and friend here as we have done over the past seven years.

Greetings from Anantara..! 

Firstly, thank you for writing a review regarding your stay with us. Although it’s difficult to hear the not so good stuff we highly appreciate you sharing your negative experience as it helps us to rectify all downfalls and move forward without recurrence. 

I'm sorry to hear about your wife's injury and I do wish a speedy recovery. I do understand the prices may be too high but allow me to explain too as the country is going through a dreadful crisis even to date, the cost of goods/products in Sri Lanka have sky rocketed and naturally we have had to adjust the pricing of food & Beverages as to not run at loss. 

Secondly thank you for the positive remarks made as well and I'm sure the staff will be delighted to hear about your experience. Our primary objective is our guest’s satisfaction, and your kind words reaffirm the hard work we put in each day. It was a pleasure hosting you at our property. 

I would like to humbly ask you not to get discouraged and give us a chance. Please reach out to me personally – yfernando@anantara.com  for any future stays. 

We look forward to welcoming you back. Until next time, from all of us here at Anantara, be safe and take care...! 

Sunny regards,

Restaurant and Spa prices very high, you get so much better outside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have to start by saying that I base this review on our experiences and that could well be very different for someone else. Overall it just did not work out for us as planned and if we had to do it again will probably choose another area and hotel. But first have to highlight the many positives the hotel offer. The grounds and rooms are fantastic and we had an amazing sea view. Most facilities are well maintained and great and offer something for everyone. The staff we encountered are great, and would like to mention Sayuri that really tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We mostly used room service (will get to food experience later) and food quality was good. Now for some items that made it an average stay for us : On night one we had a very bad experience at Verala restaurant and whilst it is in a beautiful setting, the incident put us off. The Chef did apologise next day and we excepted but could not go back. It is also very expensive in relation to what other hotels, area and country offer and we found for example that $20 for a breakfast box per person if you go on a trip, or $40 for the buffet per person fairly expensive. You can get 8 to 10 pizzas for the same price. The pool was busy, screaming kids and kids naked or in nappy in the pool.  Nothing the staff can do but very inconsiderate guests. The sea is rough, very rough and be careful. My wife and I (our own stupidity) went into the sea and was knocked over by waves when we were ankle deep and pulled back by the very strong streams, we not the best shape or swimmers but believe if a guest did not help us it could have been worst. The lifeguard did unfortunately not see the incident but helped us when we got back with some ice and cream etc. The hotel offered medical services but we did not think anything required and did not want to take anything at that stage but when we got home my wife went for X-rays and actually fractured her arm. As I said this is not the resort’s fault but it did put a massive damper on our experience.  This is the first time we used the Anantara Group and we believe based on our own experience it is not for us. Overall a beautiful resort and great staff, but overpriced and we expected a more exclusive, adult like experience and maybe some warnings at the beach. From other reviews and people at the resort it is evident that there is a market out there that really enjoy this type venue… just make sure it is for you and you will have a great time. If in doubt, you may walk away wondering if you could have done better.","Was maybe just not for us","2022-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r833261850-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

- [ ] Grounds of the hotel - visually very nice and well maintained, lovely views and nature all around you
- [ ] Pool area / Loungers were good
- [ ] Italian and Asian restaurant great service and good food (what you expect from a 5 star hotel)
- [ ] Yoga in the morning 
- [ ] Gym well equipped and well supervised
- [ ] Spa facilities good and great selection of treatments 
The bad 
- [ ] Breakfast- slow with tea and coffee regardless if busy or not, drinks often came after we finished food
- [ ] The buffet area did not enforce the required dress code so quite often people were walking around in tracksuits whilst their children were screaming and running around. Not what you expect for being in a 5 star resort. Whilst I appreciate the resort can’t control children however putting some family time slots would help resolve this and actually make it more enjoyable for guests without children- in the end we were advised to come down to breakfast at 7am to avoid the onslaught of chaos
- [ ] The buffet food itself started of great but as the hotel became busier the quality of food become less 
- [ ] Poolside lunch area; food very good but service was more often than not painfully slow and on most occasions they ended up serving me with the wrong drink
- [ ] The lobby / bar area: went for drinks several times and can honestly say only on one occasion were the drinks served effectively and timely. On another evening waited over 1 hour, as no staff could be found and the resort quite. Also there is no atmosphere here, some light background music on a evening would help
- [ ] General comment about the waiting staff in these areas- every bill comes with a service charge (which I have no problem in paying) however the service you receive is not 5 star more 3/4 and it seems unless you tip on top of this your lucky to get the basic service and acknowledgment. I understand the hotel have a lot of new staff however they need better training to begin with. I did check that the staff do receive the service charge from the bills and they confirmed they did- so I question just how badly are the hotel paying them to begin with?
- [ ] Little to no entertainment on the night however when it comes to their own staff party music blaring out across the resort and strobe lights to go with it 
- [ ] Cleaning of the room: typically still not done by lunchtime and whilst a basic clean round was done there was no nice finishing touches i,e decoration on the bed etc. On the occasions we did leave money out for the cleaner, the room was cleaned to a slightly higher standard but again not what you expect from a 5 star resort 
Quick wins 
- [ ] There is a lovely bar next to the Asian restaurant overlooking the beach - open it during the day to serve lunch and drinks 
- [ ] More restaurants onsite otherwise if your here for any length of time it is inevitable you end up in the dreaded buffet 
- [ ] Decide whether you market the resort as a family or adults only resort as the the moment it doesn’t work having both - if a more family vibe then put on some entertainment which will hopefully reduce the number of screaming children about the place in evenings - also have a family pool area ( there is enough space )","Over priced and not 5 star","2022-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r828007797-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

All of this - for me - detracted from the wonderful bird calls and encounters with peacocks, langurs, monitors, hares, sunbirds and egrets. 
My biggest criticism though was how difficult it was to find vegetarian food, or Sri Lankan dishes. The buffet was an array of flesh and very few vegetables.

Con's - We had requested for a drivers accommodation to be sorted out by the hotel itself as due to COVID, the hotel cannot staff the drivers. (This was requested 
  via phone call & email with all 3 meals & A/C for a friend of ours who was also our driver).However the spot arranged had been a very dingy spot that was not humanly possible to stay at. As guests we knew we had to incur the cost for the drivers accommodation. It was quite inconvenient as the driver had to drive up to the hotel to collect his food pack for the 3 meals. There was no prior briefing for the drivers saying about the timings for the food collection, our driver had arrived at 8.30AM to collect his breakfast pack but turned back saying breakfast was over & that he should have come by 7AM. Would appreciate a bit of humanity when treating our drivers as well. If you are planning to head their with your driver, please make sure clear instructions are given & that the hotel looks into it.

Room for improvement - The buffet spread for dinner was quite disappointing but however breakfast was quite satisfactory.","Our Stay at Peace Haven, Tangalle","2020-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r781552857-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

That said, it is a large chain hotel geared to providing meals, facilities, etc., to numerous guests at a time.
The coffee shop/buffet restaurant is satisfactory, but quite busy, since many guests opt for the half-board basis.  We did have one very good meal from the ala carte menu.  We found one of the other restaurants, Il Mare, to be overpriced and understaffed, resulting in waiters rushing to and fro, and a red snapper filet which can best be described as mediocre.
The villa rooms are lovely and spacious, each with its own pool, and given the restaurant quality, we opted for room service on more than one occasion.
Having stayed at both the Anantara Peace Haven and the Anantara Kalutara in Sri Lanka, our preference is definitely Kalutara for its more personal service and better food quality and ambience in its restaurants.
Our thanks to our villa staff for providing wonderful service and help throughout our stay.
Room Tip:  Book a villa.

Thank you so much for taking the time to visit us recently and for writing such a positive review of your experience.    

We are all happy to read that you enjoyed the superb location that we are blessed with, amazing array of wildlife, spacious and comfortable rooms, good quality of evening buffet, and overall you enjoyed your holiday. However, please accept my apologies that your stay was clearly not flawless and that there were many small issues that lead to disappointment. The idea of having a Resort Host is so that guests have a one-stop point of contact that they can simply send a whatsapp to make requests such as preferred timing for room cleaning, dietary preferences, if they would like any information or a private tour, restaurant bookings, tour bookings, or if they have any concerns that they would like to share with the management so that we can help rectify them. This generally works very well and makes communication easy and convenient. All our facilities, restaurants, activities, and general resort info is highlighted in our Newsletter which is on the writing table in every room, the resort compendium, the guest key card packet, our website, resort TV, and on multiple standing posters displayed all throughout the resort. We also have dedicated Concierge, 24 hour reception, and Resort Host service should our guests have any enquires or be looking for inspiration on what to do during their time with us. We are all disappointed to learn that you both did not depart truly happy and I am sorry that we let you down. If your travels do bring you back to the South Coast, then please let us know, as we would love to have you back again so that we can ensure that your next experience is perfect.   

With warm regards,

On a good note:
The location is just superb. Great scenery, nice landscape, totally amazing wild life that always keeps you entertained. The rooms are quite specious and well planned (although the finishing is below the other Anantara properties we have stayed). Very decent buffet in the main restaurant for dinner,
On a not so good note:
The food: the selection for breakfast never changes (ok, I've noticed 2 times of ham rotating, that's it) with the fruits selection being extremely basic (to say the least). The selection for lunch on the set menu (if you go HB or FB) in the Italian restaurant is just a disaster - only one non-vegeterian main dish is really sad (how often can you have a carbonara for lunch?) To add to this, most of the times few dishes where not available, and while I can understand the lack of Tuna, but not having mozzarella for all this time is surprising. The service is incredibly slow and not really friendly (which doesn't match at all with the restaurants' ambitions). The fusion restaurant is slightly better but one would expect something more impressive at this price point (and not to mess up with the number of ppl that reserved the table). The pool-side bar has a decent menu (comparing to others) but not having an AC at lunch time is close to unbearable this time of the year. Ah, and the prices for food/drinks in the menu are as if you are visiting a 2* Micheline restaurant in Provance...
The service:
I guess this was the biggest disappointment of the stay. We have arrived late at night and while our reservation clearly stated 3 ppl there was no extra bed available in the room - so after the flight and the 4h drive we had to stay up an extra hour till 4am until it was sorted. 
Having the host idea is splendid, yet it would be great to train them first. I have never seen my host in all my stay - only used whatsApp and frankly I have managed to solve most of my needs quicker by walking down to the reception. So this didn't really add-up to the experience.
While the hotel area is great, we have never had an overview of what's there around (or where we can dine) - we had to find it all by ourselves, mostly looking at reviews and instagram (that's how we found out about the nice farm animals area and the fusion restaurant). Just accidentally we've found out that they serve a great tea in the lobby terrace and only at the last 2 days we've found that they serve shisha there as well - both only when we asked for this. No one ever approached us while we where sitting there offering a menu etc. There is a guided tour talking about animals/plants every morning at 9:30am but you've got to have great luck finding about it (we just bumped into the group) and surviving the heat - we gave up in 15 minutes (so did many others). It most definitely has to be an early morning/late afternoon adventure.
The room service was totally dependant on luck - one shift was superb and extra-attentive, the other was average to say the least. I wonder how often/careful they wash the floors as the feet would suggest something close to ""very rare"". I get it that the hotel was at 100% occupancy but not having room service until 3-4pm is extremely disappointing (one needs towel at least when he gets back from the pool).
Facilities: I would like to understand what audience is the hotel targeting at - for the kids there is absolutely nothing to do. The kids club is very basic and the only staff there is not really trained. The pool would be OK but there isn't even a lifeguard there and the rules of the pool forbid inflatable devices and ""playing"" in the pool. The beach is not children friendly at all (if you were planning to buy the any children toys/diapers or whatever else in the hotel - don't, there is nothing).
At the same time, the situation for adults is even worse as the ""adults"" pool is occupied by children and, again, there is nothing else to do (apart from few yoga/fitness classes), specially in the evenings.
One of the most annoying things - the club-cars/tuk-tuk's in the hotel area. One can't enjoy a nice walk from the lobby to the beach without being asked to move out at least 3-4 times. Each time. And if you have a stroller - well you either move to the grass or feel the pressure from the drivers to speed up. Why can't they use dedicated routes or just make the pathways wider?

All and all, we managed to have a good holiday - but because of the nature itself and outside tours rather then the hotel. A lot of issues are definitely below the standard of a reputable 5* hotel, specially with such a brand.","Great location and wiled life, not so great the rest","2019-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r666421945-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Get your own drinks and snacks outside and put them in the room fridge if you can. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Uga Bay was unfortunately marred by a significant payment issue. We were charged twice, which not only took funds away that could have been used during our holiday but also required us to spend a considerable amount of time proving that the payments were taken from our account. This resulted in us spending time on the phone and messaging the hotel, which was not the best start to our stay. This experience was a source of great disappointment and affected our mood, lingering throughout our stay at Uga Bay.

Despite these issues, the overall experience was pleasant, with a clean environment and beautiful surroundings. The hotel is fantastic, situated right on a private beach with a large pool and beautiful ocean views. We felt very secure with guards at all entry points, including the beach. The room, located on the first floor with a sea view, was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a la carte, which felt limited, but the waiter, Munas, ensured we were satisfied, offering additional options. Although the lunch and dinner menu was limited, the staff was attentive and accommodating. However, prices in the restaurant and minibar were quite high, with the minibar prices being particularly excessive (i.e. a small beer can $6 + 10% service + VAT, or cioccolate bar $10+...). Overall, a good stay with room for improvement in the pricing and payment process.

However, my stay left me somewhat disappointed compared to other options in terms of value for money.

On the positive side, the beachfront location of Uga Bay Resort is excellent, providing picturesque views and a serene atmosphere. The overall ambiance of the resort is pleasant, contributing to a relaxing stay.

Unfortunately, the main letdown was the buffet and food offerings. Compared to other resorts in the area, the quality, variety, and taste of the buffet fell short of expectations. There was a lack of options for children, and the restaurant staff seemed indifferent to addressing this issue. Even the Sri Lankan cuisine lacked authenticity and flavor, leaving much to be desired.

Despite these shortcomings, other amenities at Uga Bay Resort were satisfactory. However, the overall experience was overshadowed by the subpar dining experience.

In conclusion, while Uga Bay Resort boasts excellent beachfront location and satisfactory amenities, the disappointing buffet offerings detract from its overall appeal. Potential guests should consider alternative options in the area for a more satisfying culinary experience.","Mixed Experiences at Uga Bay","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r939670410-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

I’ve struggled to give this a 3* , only based on location can I offer this. 

We had come from Uga Jungle which is simply amazing so my expectations were the same and we were excited for this stay. However it’s not what it seems. 

On the eye it is beautiful, the beach is lovely! 

Pros
Beach, rooms you must request at the front of beach, swimming pool

That’s where it ends! 

Cons
Staff service poor, this isn’t their fault , there is a poor communication between the management and staff. Only one staff member impressed- Robinson! 
Food - simply awful. It’s a buffet , very poor choice, uncooked food served to us at beach bar and no quality. We are big foodies and considering how good Uga Jungle is I was shocked. 

Let me take you through.
Check in - messy & confusing 
Rooms - lovely we were allocated 46 & 44. Luggage came quickly. We had a plate of fruit delivered, only to be followed by a request for Trip Advisor review - I absolutely hate this kind of direct request. We were told that we had a special dining that night - we turned up for dinner and nothing , in fact it was all messy. No drinks poured for us, no explanation on dining or menu offered. Food was cold and tasteless. We are in Sri Lanka after all and expecting spice and flavour. I had pre booked spa before we arrived, I kept receiving mixed calls to the room from reception regarding this. 
Breakfast again very bland and absolutely no atmosphere in restaurant. 
Beach bar menu is ok and we managed to pay for lunch. But unfortunately we received uncooked food. 
I did at this point have a conversation with one of the managers and highlighted our concerns & experience. They agreed to arrange a beach dinner for us. The chef was going to create a special menu for us. 
We were looking forward to this. Despite taking any dietary requirements at check in these were ignored by the chef - this was particularly important as one member of my family is pregnant. The setting was nice but the food was not. Nothing local or special, warmed up pasta, meat that was not edible and very basic. A complete let down.

We went to bed early and the next day I made the decision to check us out early and head to our next hotel in Kandy.

I expressed my concerns to the general manager and other management, however they didn’t like to accept this. 

I feel the hotel is trying to cater for international guests and getting it so wrong. I have my own travel business and I honestly couldn’t send any guests here. They tried to say we were treated like vip and that wasn’t what I wanted , I want to enjoy an experience that I can be sure my clients would receive. 

In closing this is the most expensive hotel in the area and simply not worth it. I wouldn’t return and won’t be recommending.","Poor service and terrible food","2023-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r892408041-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The turkey meat in the main course wasn’t fresh which thereby led to a terrible taste. This obviously ruined our appetites and expectations about the Gala. Furthermore, the cheese platter that followed afterwards was unfortunately tasteless. Most of the cheese had a bland, disgusting flavour to it which was quite unpleasant with the combination of the soggy crackers. In other words this dinner was a disappointment.

The manager was kind and stood by his staff regarding my missing money. After mentioning how bad the food was,  the management did do a lovely gesture of a special meal on the beach, which was delicious and sincerely appreciated. The rooms are fine and the property is well maintained.  The chairs on the barely there patio were not comfortable for reading or sitting. 
I stayed at 4 properties this company owns. This one was fine for the money, but the food could of been better. However, it may just be me and the buffet was better than I am giving it credit for. 
I had a nice time and the beach was lovely. I think the rooms should have activities listed like snorkeling etc but shampoo etc is all provided. All in all a good time was had.

It is worth paying a bit extra to get the first floor ocean view rooms and Roshan gave us the best sea view rooms (front left side with closest beach access). We could see the ocean from the balcony and also had a great view from our bathroom. The pool is very well maintained and warm (almost jacuzzi like) and the view across to the beach was great.

We had dinner on the first 2 nights at the resort and this was substandard for a hotel of this status. The food lacked flavour and the curries were watery. We also tried the western a la carte menu which was difficult to stomach (catch of the day was particularly disappointing). The seafood and vegetables were certainly not fresh which is such a shame given the great produce available in the region (we had the sense of mass catering and food recycling). The pastries at breakfast were stale and hard, yet huge quantities were served on large trays - my advice would be quality over quantity! Same menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner is just not acceptable for a resort of this stature. They had 1 buffet breakfast which was the best they served. We were told that they don’t do the food stations as it was the off season. It is not really an excuse to serve poor food in off season - simply quantities need to be adjusted downwards. As a result, we had to unfortunately leave the hotel to have dinner outside (and many other guests did the same). We were lucky to find hotel Vasuki on trip advisor which served fresh, authentic food cooked to high standard. The quality of the food is probably the only downside to this hotel and let it down. 

We used their entertainment suit to watch the football Chelsea vs Man United game on the big screen on our first night. The games room with table tennis, carom and chess boards was well maintained and had great views of the sea. 

Staff were really friendly and made us very welcome, albeit a number were very young and felt inexperienced and not that knowledgeable about details. There were a lot of staff in the restaurant just waiting around and at loose ends - potentially overinvestment in front of house rather than the engine room of the kitchen! The beach is lovely but the service is not that well coordinated (I.e. no cold water, lack of attendants providing towels etc.). 
Overall we enjoyed the pool and the beach although the food here needs significant improvement!","Stunning Beach Resort but needs Improvement in the Food served","2018-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r629789148-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Had expected rooms overlooking beach but had very mid-range upstairs rooms at opposite ends of block at the back of the resort (Ocean rooms). Rooms were swapped on second night which gave us adjoining ground floor rooms (Beach Rooms), with deck overlooking lawns and beach (middle row of blocks). Nice views but couldn't have sheer curtains open as everyone walking past would have had an equally view into our room! No idea why they have floor to ceiling windows with wooden blinds in ground floor bathrooms!? Bathrooms need some work - smelly drain in shower.
Hotel gave us a slightly later check out on one room and then kindly offered a room for us to shower and change after a last swim as we had a late flight. Disappointing that the room they use for this is so grim - it leaves you with a very poor last image of the hotel! Very basic room with barely any furniture and odd items being stored. Horrid shower room - 2* hotel standard. Surely in such a large place they could find one decent room to use or have a shower/changing room as part of the gym?
Nice staff, who try hard but need more support and training - service was very slow - drinks at main bar took forever and cocktails were not worth the wait.  
Beach bar food is good - seafood skewers delicious. Buffet dinner was better than expected and they offer Sri Lankan dishes every night alongside ""Asian night"", ""Western food"", ""Italian night"" etc. Restaurant area on terrace is cramped in the evenings and the breakfast (served in buffet room) is very over crowded.  Don't sit near the cooking stations on the terrace in the evening!
Beach is beautiful but too hot to sit out when we were there. Lovely beds under palm trees were great and Pool/Beach Man was very helpful.

Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback, we have spoken to the GM and investigated this matter. I have since learned that upon departure a late checkout was requested and since we were running on full house we were unable to accommodate your request.  Instead of leaving our guests without accommodation for the rest of the stay, the staff kindly offered you the former resident manager’s quarters to change and relax prior to departure as a gesture of goodwill. Please note that these rooms are not sold to any guests, but was given on complimentary basis as a place to rest until  departure instead of being forced to say at the lobby as would be the norm.

Our restaurant does have an outdoor area, however as the sun is quite strong during the daytime, we arrange space outside where guests can have the Breakfast if they wish. Apart from this, we do keep some extra covers in the main bar area if preferred. All bed and breakfast basis guests are free to dine at the beach bar or choose from our a la carte menu if not satisfied with the buffet dinner provided. 

Unfortunately, as we are not an isolated property, but just one of the many hotels on the stretch, we cannot control the number of Jet ski’s or limit their operation, we can, however, assure you that boundaries are clearly demarcated so that swimmers are safe at all times.

I do hope we have shed some light on the circumstances around this complaint, I do hope you visit us again in future.

Even though most of the staff is friendly and well intentioned, the pool and beach area is nice, the rooms are quite large, there are a lot of things to improve:
1. They do not seem to consider that maintenance is important: one of the window sealing was suspended in the air, the shower water smells horrible immediately after turning it on, the shower hanger was broken, there is a gap between the floor and the door so if you leave the lights on in the evening you will have insects in your room, some part of the wall in our room was swollen, we had mould on our shower cabin, the paint on the blinds of  the shower window was peeling, there is no  isolation in the room so you can hear the footsteps of your neighbors or their conversations;
2. Cleaning is not their strongest point: one morning my tea mug had lipstick stains (they weren’t mine), we received in multiple days dirty or stained towels, the curtains in the room had staines on them, the only napkin provided at breakfast was dirty or had stains on it;
3. I asked for a late check out, at first they said it was not possible because the room needed to be prepared for the other guests. When I asked again they said they could extend it for 1,5 hours and if I needed more I had to pay USD 20 for 3 hours;
4. They didn’t deliver all the messages sent by the travel agent: some changes on the departure time occurred and no one told me (luckily, I called to double check and this is how I found out);
5. The breakfast is not that varied, it is ok for 4-5 days and for what they offer it is quite expensive (approximately USD 14 per person). Also, most of their prices are net of VAT, service charges and any other 
charges so it is hard to know how much an item in the menu costs. ","Resort ","2018-06","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r587772795-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

What falls short of our expectations and experience at the restaurant is the service at the beachfront bar.

Thank you for having stayed at Uga Bay. We are pleased to note that you were happy with the ambiance of the resort and the service level of our staff. However we regret to hear that you were not entirely satisfied with your stay.

While thanking you for your valuable feedback we sincerely hope you will visit us again in the future.

The beach on water is gorgeous.  They do have chairs set out on the beach however these are old and not 5*.  We didn't use them as it was way to windy.  Checkin and check out were good.  They did ask over and over again how everything was.  However if you did state there were some things which were worth addressing they then started to blame the local staff or or or.  In short don't ask if you don't want to hear and don't make excuses. Gardens were impeccable.  Had a massage and the masseuse was about the most unfriendly person there.  It was like how dare I be there.  It was suppose to be for an hour but it was 45 minutes.  She didn't smile once. Would not recommend a massage. Air conditioner in room was very loud.

However we regret to hear that you were not fully satisfied with your stay. Each of our hotels are unique and offer an authentic experience of its own. Uga Bay being a modern beach hotel, is designed for a more relaxed beach experience and is less traditional compared to the other hotels in our chain. As you may have noticed Uga hotels are designed to accommodate the atmosphere, culture and architecture around it. 

The level of service extended by our staff is usually highly appreciated, while we thank you for bringing to our notice your concerns. Same has been discussed with the team at Uga Bay. 

The buffet we offered during your stay had a mix of a Sri Lankan corner as many of our guests prefer to have a local experience, and a wide spread of internationals dishes also served separately. 

Thank you once again for your feedback as it is highly appreciated since we strive to continuously improve our guest experience. Hope that you will find an opportunity to visit us again.

Best Regards,
Ramli

Its quite a big property. our room was quite spacious and i like the fact there are two entrances to the room and they have kept water pots in both ends so we can wash our legs before coming to the room.
I thought there will be something special and exiting gestures like you get in Ulagalla so i was bit disappointed. its a beach hotel. Staff are nice but not really professional. they need more training. and would have been nice if they speak and understand english cause there were few misunderstandings in communication.

I didnt like the buffet. there were lot of sri lankan items in the menue even though there  are many foreign nationalities. very few international dishes. we were on Full Board so the dinning was not very exiting. 

Its a shame that they close the pool by 6.30 cause its very hot over there and would be been nice if they at least allow us to swim till 8 pm may be. maximum hight of the pool is 4ft.","Perhaps I had high expectations","2017-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r481250542-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Thank you for staying at Uga Bay. We appreciate your kind comments on all 3 of our properties.

However we regret that you were not fully satisfied with your stay at Uga Bay. While you had mentioned that there are no activities, please be informed that we do in-fact offer a range of activities at our resort. From a range of water sports such as Jet Skiing, Diving, Snorkeling to Nature cycle tours, cookery demonstrations and  additional excursions to nearby world heritage site, national parks and city tours.

Each of our resorts embodies the unique atmosphere around and its interior and design is done to merge with its environment. We regret to know that this was not to your preference.

We take our guests experience very seriously and we thank you for your feedback.  We do hope that you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

We had arrived from The Residence and Ulagalla, which are both unique and offer a lot of attention to detail to their guests. Perhaps if we came to Uga Bay first we wouldn't have had such high expectations. The hotel itself is nice and one of the nicest on this beach in our opinion, but the beach is lifeless and lacking activity. The sea is ok, but not particularly enticing. The restaurant serves good food, but the setting is uninspiring, lacks ambience and is always closed in with plastic blinds. During our stay the hotel offered no daily activity or entertainment, so unless you go on a tour there is nothing to do. The spa is also very unappealing located in a bunker under the pool. We left after 3 nights although in our package we had paid for 5.

Thank you for staying at Uga Bay and taking your time off to review us. 

We are very pleased to hear that overall, you are happy with your stay at our hotels and that your time at Uga Bay was a pleasant one.  
We appreciate you bringing up your concerns on the breakfast and the ambiance. Since we were running almost full house, we had buffet on both the days during your stay. The culinary experience we offer is usually highly appreciated but we understand that you did not share a similar sentiment. 

We do hope that you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

Le personnel est adorable de gentillesse mais d’une lenteur terrible.

Les restaurants (un a la piscine l autre a la plage) sont mauvais. Quasi aucun plats locaux, que de la tres mauvaise cuisine internationale malheureusement, à des prix dementiels. (Le petit club sandwitch est le seul plat mangeable, a 16$ hors taxes) 
Point positif : beaucoup d’oiseaux, d ecureuils geants, de molitor, etc qui donnent un peu d interet au lieu.

After the atrocities experienced in Sri Lanka at Easter I was unsure what travelling around would be like. Im happy to report that apart from increased security checks including Police checkpoints stopping vehicles especially at night, it was very relaxed. It was also very quiet with very few tourists.

Firstly please learn from my mistake and either take a car and driver if you have plenty of time or, fly Cinnamon Air to access Trincomalee (and the Jungle Beach resort). The overnight train from Colombo is only for those sound sleepers with the good luck to only encounter healthy travellers...if you catch my drift!

Accommodation at the JBR is great! Large rooms with high ceilings (c/w ceiling fans) and a/c, big comfy bed, private veranda under a small shade cloth, large bathroom and best of all, a private outdoor shower!! 

The beach was about 50m from the resort restaurant and my room and the water was calm and refreshing. Coming from the Middle East I really appreciated the increase in humidity and temperatures in the high 20s/low 30s. June is a great time to visit the East Coast as it’s the dry season, while at the same time it’s the wet season on the West Coast. 

I had included my food restrictions when I booked however these had not obviously been passed on to the kitchen. That said the chef did a great job making sure I had gluten free bread and personally checked my every food order to ensure I didn’t get anything that would cause me problems. 

Food wise I would say that if I was doing the same trip again I’d bring some Gf/df snacks with me. The only snacks the resort offered that I could eat were peanuts roasted in palm oil...which I left untouched for ethical reasons. 

I tried the Spa which was nice enough although rather expensive (Dubai prices) for what was provided. However, when I came to check-out the resort had given a USD100 spa voucher (unbeknown to me up to that point) to everyone booking beachside accommodation. It would have been nice to have known that prior to booking the treatment. Also, the spa experience would be greatly enhanced by mood lighting, some incense and the offer of a healthy tea and snack afterwards. 

Staff at JBR deserve a mention. They were lovely. Note to those training staff, one person asking if a guest’s meal is good is welcome; three, especially one after the other, is a little much!

Overall, the resort is rather let down by the lack of maintenance around the property. Guests being charged resort prices in USD don’t really want to see thatching that needs patching, holes in bed covers, light fixtures with wires hanging out. It’s a pretty easy thing to get right - and make the right impression on guests. 

As I’m someone who likes to do stuff on holiday I would have appreciated some sunrise yoga sessions or kayaks to paddle around the bay...just an idea for the future. 

Be aware if you are coeliac that here in Sri Lanka they sell a ‘cider’, that is actually beer mixed with apple juice...

The location is fairly remote so you have limited/ no options once you arrive there, you’re kind of stuck. The beach is nice but the plastic pollution  either side is utterly depressing. The pool area is disappointing (tiny for the number of cabins and rarely gets the sun) if you want to sunbathe the beach is your only option. There is another pool which is shown in the pictures on the website but seems shut off from the public (which I found misleading). We started off in a lagoon cabin which was thoroughly disappointing. It was damp and in desperate need of a refurb (evidence of roof leaks in bathroom). The are also two storey so if you are downstairs all you can hear is people banging around upstairs mixed with the noise of the road out front. We upgraded to a beach cabin which was a much better experience. 

Meal times are totally chaotic, no front of house, staff seemingly without a set routine. You can easily wait 20 minutes for your drink order to be taken and the next course and the next. That being sad, as with anywhere in Sri Lanka the staff are absolutely charming and polite, they just need some management to help them coordinate better. For a chain of hotels you would think they could manage this. The food is delicious. Absolute highlights were the tempura prawns (enormous) at the beach bar (which was under construction - another slight annoyance which had been temporarily put together out of some corrugated iron which my husband and no doubt countless others had cut themselves on which waiting). The other disappointment was the relative lack of seafood options given that the resort is on the sea and right by a big fish market in Trincomalee. The food and drink is also unbelievably overpriced. The taxes are not included in the price so everything is +27%. Also check your bill because the restaurant chaos invariably spills into the bill side of things. 

Unfortunately I wish we had swerved this part of our trip and spent longer in the beautiful interior.","Disappointing ","2019-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r669359952-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

But is doesn‘t compare to other Uga hotels in terms of service and standard.

Service is very friendly, but at times very very slow, especially at  the restaurants. There is no service at the beach, although you can order at the beach bar and they will bring you your food and drinks. The jetski was not working for the entire 3-day stay and no one seemed to bother to try to repair it. The wifi was not working for part of the stay and when it was, it was extremely slow. The flip-flops in the room had footmarks from previous use, and some towels had holes. These are all details, but show a lack of care. This was confirmed by the fact that no one bothered to ask how our stay was upon departure.

A security issue is the fact that there is a life guard at the beach, however instead of acting as a life guard, he has several other jobs, including handing out towels and taking care of deck chairs, and often disappears for longer periods of time, likely taking care of some other jobs. One can only hope that no accidents ever happen.

I would like to commend the staff at the beach restaurant though. One night, my fish was not good (which they could not help). I was immediately offered a different fish, which was excellent. The next night I ordered a steak medium done, which came to the table blue. Again, I was immediately offered a new steak and a free desert, along with an apology and a friendly smile. I really appreciated that service, because I felt the manager of the restaurant cared a great deal about his guests.

Jungle beach is set up quite great, removed from the town and true to its name, nearly all jungle - with a bit of wild too! 
The service by the staff was pretty great- check in was a breeze and the staff is resourceful and incredibly nice - that’s something I’ve noticed about people on the east and the north. 

The negatives of the place is that the rooms and amenities, despite being expensive, are very basic . The shampoo and other items in the bathroom were labeled by hand (??!!) , the A/C kept turning on and off and made a terrible noice, the breakfast menu could be better - atleast alternating on days - cos it’s all the same everyday . 

Overall, I suppose I would still go back just for what the place is - but they’d need to refurbish the place just to make sure it’s comfortable enough

Thank you for taking the time to give us  detailed feedback on your stay and brining your concerns to our attention. 

As a resort based in the jungle, we are subject to insects however, we have a pest control program in place and will increase our efforts to control this issue as much as we can. We do offer insect repellents at public areas in the form of a spray as candles are not suitable in open areas due to the large fans and winds. Our humble apologies for the delays in service, our unique breakfast concept takes approximately 60 – 70 minutes to complete, I can assure you the delay was not an attempt on our part to secure beverage sales, but a lack of efficiency and I will personally take this up with the team. In regard to your feedback on our sunbeds, unfortunately the 68 beds are on first come first serve basis we can assure availability if they are vacated during the day. 

Thank you again for bringing these points to our attention, we hope to welcome you again to an Uga Property in the near future

Being well traveled we do have high expectations  and always end our holiday with a 5/6 day beach stop.
On arrival I wasn't really impressed and just coming from Uga ullagalla which was 5 stars I was hoping for the same here seeing they are part of the same chain.

Room- decent Aircon, no Aircon in bathroom which is strange as you have a shower then are sweating straight away afterwards. WiFi is ok in room but patchy at best around resort.
The cleaners don't shut the doors properly so have found alot of bugs in room.
The outside space is in the shade so you cannot sunbathe if you chose to do so.
If you order room service they take a long time to pick plates back up.

Restaurant- sit on the far right hand side away from the pool and ponds as that side is full of flies and mosquitos landing on your table/food.
Do not sit in the drop down part in middle of restaurant this is full of flies.
Service is so slow breakfast and dinner can take 2 hours and is really dragged out trying to make you order more drinks maybe?
If you want to upgrade to a la carter from half board with a set boring menu you have to pay full price rather than the difference in the cost which is what I was expecting.
Half board menu is very limited and if you don't like sea food can be even worse.
No insect repellent candles etc which would make sitting here and eating a bit more comfortable.

Pool- 
Didn't bother using as is covered in shade full of mosquitos

Beach side bar - Had couple meals here, check your bill before you sign as drinks were on there that we never had.
Food was ok just took a long time to come.
Needs some sort of insect repellent here also.

Beach- There is rubbish on the beach not loads but if you walk past the boat area you see quite a bit of rubbish.

Don't leave your sun bed!
Don't leave your sun bed! 

We went to our room to avoid the midday sun for one hour and our towels had been removed so we have to go to the far side of the beach. The only reason for this i think is there are not enough sun beds for how many rooms they have here!
There isn't a proper waiter service on beach either which is standard in any 5 star resort I've visited.

Staff seem friendly enough I just don't think the management or the owners perhaps know what is expected especially from a place that is expensive. 
Abroad you expect to be mugged off a little perhaps but for what the staff get paid to what we pay to come here it doesn't make me want to recommend to anyone.

With a bit of a re- shuffle this could be 5 star stay but a long way off that mark at present.

Please ask for no straws with your drink unless
You really need ine. They put straws in all the drinks and the beach is full of them. 

A tour to pigeon island that was cancelled due to the weather was expensive and we found a much more enjoyable cheaper option away from this hotel.

No yoga.
No boutique

To be fair we are out of season somaybe this is the case. Weather and staff are very good, and they are all a bit too eager to please, so perhaps if you go in a busier time you won't have them following you around.

This place lacked character for me, and the staff overly attentive which made me feel uneasy most of the time.

Thank you for your stay at Jungle Beach and taking time off to review. We are happy to hear that you were satisfied with the ambiance of the hotel, the setup of the Villa,  the fine culinary experience offered and the staffs’ service level. 

However, it is unfortunate that you did experience some flies at the bar. This is very seasonal. Although we have an in-house resident pest controller, at times due to the seasonality there can be a very rare occurrence. 

Our transport rates to Trincomalee is very much inline with the industry standards for the service we offer which also includes a tax component. Also please be assured that service charges and government taxes are based on the standard rate of 23.04% and not 46%. 

Your comments on the music and the breakfast service is well noted and same has been communicated to the resort.

We thank you once again for your feedback and we do hope that you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

Regards,

Ramli Ghaffoor
Director/CEO

So onto...

Positives:- 
1. Lovely beach, amazing beach, with snorkelling available and a jet ski, secure as well, no hawkers.
2. Villas are all lovely, well presented and aircon is good. Nice bathrooms. 
3. Lovely pool by the bar 
4. Good gym for Sri Lanka 
5. Lovely staff, well mannered and helpful 
6. Food was nice, a bit fancy for Sri Lanka and I get what they were trying to do, but a deconstructed tuna salad... In Sri Lanka? It's fine if the menu actually tells you what it is properly and how small it is and you'll be starving in an hour! Curries were nice and we had room service and it was good. 

Negatives:-
1. The flies at the bar area, now I know it's the ""jungle"" but having just come from a villa complex of 8 in the real jungle with all sorts of living things, there were no blue bottle flies, which means the tables in the bar area weren't clean ( I'm sure the manager will dispute this) but all they need is to turn on all the fans and put some candles out all day, you just couldn't sit at the bar. 
2. The service, lacked consistency, especially at breakfast. The menu was good, but at breakfast you were given everything on a tray, all I wanted was muesli and coffee and that took an age, at one point my omelette came before the dry muesli. It seems if you go off the ""tray"" service the waiters go into meltdown. The dinner service was the same, and lunch, I had a tuna salad, which doesn't mention its raw and asked for it to be pan fried, dear god, you would think I had asked them to go out and catch the tuna? 20 mins later it arrives back. 
3. £55 dollars to the airport in their hotel car? What? My fault I should have planned ahead and kept our driver for another two days but really £55 in Sri Lanka is a fortune.
4. Service Charge and VAT or hotel charge, equates to 23% so when I ordered a prawn cocktail and a tuna salad, they came on a separate bill while the water was separate too, so I paid 46% service charge or hotel charge! Then we had three bottles of water later on the beach, another service charge although I took them back to my lounger. What! 
5. Place is in the middle of nowhere so if you want snacks or water you have to buy it from hotel, and again the service charge looms! 
6. The new beach bar had banging loud techno music at lunchtime, the demographic for this hotel is mid 30's not 18 year olds in Ibiza. Also, on the beach no one comes near you to ask if you want water or anything. Although, 7 people asked me if I wanted dinner at the beachbar, how strange! 

I repeat that this is a lovely hotel, but they will loose business if they keep thinking, their so high end that it doesn't matter how you treat customers or how deep their pockets have to be. This is a great place for honeymooners, and anniversary, if you were a big family it could get expensive.

Les points positifs :
Le personnel est un vrai atout : serviable, souriant et très professionnel. Les huts sont magnifiques, spacieuses et impeccablement propres. La piscine est superbe et très agréable. La restauration est correcte, bien que j’aurais apprécié davantage de spécialités sri-lankaises à la carte. Mention spéciale au guide et au chauffeur, très compétents et attentifs.

Les points négatifs :
L’emplacement est extrêmement isolé : comptez environ cinq heures de route depuis Colombo ou Kandy. La plage, bien que proche, est non baignable et potentiellement dangereuse. Il n’y a rien à faire aux alentours, et l’unique raison de venir ici est l’espoir d’apercevoir un léopard. Malheureusement, si ce n’est pas le cas (comme pour moi), l’intérêt du séjour devient très limité.

J’ai participé au safari à 6h du matin. Après trois heures, je n’ai aperçu que quelques oiseaux, un crocodile, trois éléphants, des buffles domestiques… et des dizaines de 4x4. Beaucoup de bruit, peu de faune sauvage visible – l’effet d’un tourisme de masse ? Aucun léopard, pas d’ours. J’ai d’ailleurs vu bien plus d’animaux en dehors du parc, sur les routes environnantes.

En résumé :
Le site ne justifie ni l’isolement ni le prix, que je trouve excessif, voire indécent, au vu de l’expérience globale. Il serait plus juste d’en demander deux à trois fois moins. Sans la garantie (impossible, évidemment) d’observer un léopard, le séjour perd tout son attrait.","Un séjour contrasté : entre confort et déception","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1004272489-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

We came here largely for the safari experience - particularly to see leopards and also elephants, sloth bears, mongoose, etc in their natural environment. We have done a couple of safaris in South Africa and Botswana, and hoped this would be similar in terms of animal spotting. Unfortunately, for us, the whole experience didn’t live up to what we hoped. The safari vehicles are limited to driving on roads (unlike other parts of the world where they can go off-road) that hundreds of other jeeps/trucks of tourists were on, leading to lots of dust and few animal sightings (other than the water buffalo, peacocks and birds that are all over). Our guide explained that the animals go inside the bush away from the cars/roads (understandably). We had planned to do a 3rd safari drive, but after the first two, we cancelled the 3rd.  Of course, the hotel can’t control the crowds or ensure we saw a leopard, but having come here for the animal experience, we were disappointed with the experience. In hindsight, this was an expensive and time consuming (3 days/2 nights) part of our trip for a safari experience that for us was underwhelming. 

The hotel itself was nice, but lacked some special touches to make it truly exceptional/5 star. For example, cold towels would be a nice gesture to offer guests when they return from game drives - it’s dusty and hot out there and would be nice so we could clean our hands. The restaurant needed better ventilation/a/c - though there are a few wall a/c units and some fans, it still was very hot during lunch. Also, some fans seemed to be broken as when we asked if they could be sped up, the staff said they could not. Food itself was fine.  One time we also found that the bathrooms by the restaurant were both out of soap even though it was just 10am.  We asked the front desk for soap, but he said it would “take some time” so we instead walked back to our huts to wash our hands before returning to our breakfast. 

Staff is kind and friendly.","A bit of a let down","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1000657007-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Wild Coast Tented Lodge? Outstanding. Eraeliya Weligama? Outstanding. Ceylon Tea Trails? Fantastic. Then came UGA Chena Huts—an experience so underwhelming it left us wondering how on earth this place maintains its high rating.

This is not a five-star resort. It is, at best, a three-star establishment charging luxury prices while coasting on its location and reputation. The owners have clearly decided that “good enough” is the standard, rather than investing in what could be a truly exceptional experience.

THE POSITIVES:

✔️ Spectacular location with breathtaking views over the Indian Ocean.

✔️ Kind and professional staff—they are trying their best despite what they have to work with.

✔️ Food is decent—not exceptional, but not terrible either.

✔️ Nice sundowner setting—a moment of peace before the reality of the resort kicks back in.

✔️ Beautiful beach dinner arrangements—a rare highlight.

✔️ Decent open-air bar area—nothing special, but at least functional AND OPEN …

✔️ Excellent safari rangers—if only the resort matched their level of professionalism.

THE NEGATIVES:

1. DATED, DATED, DATED.

The entire property screams neglect. This isn’t “rustic luxury” or “understated charm”—it’s just old, tired, and uninspired.

2. The Huts? Large but Utterly Soulless.

Yes, they are spacious. But space means nothing when it’s filled with boring, outdated furniture and zero atmosphere. Staying here feels more like being in a forgotten timeshare unit than a luxury retreat.

3. The Plunge Pools? A Complete Joke.

I cannot stress this enough—the so-called private plunge pools are an atrocity. Small, cheap plastic tubs, with tiny, worn-down decks that wouldn’t even be acceptable in a low-budget roadside motel. How anyone thought this was an acceptable feature for a luxury resort is beyond comprehension.

4. The Main Pool? An Absolute Misery.

Instead of using the stunning ocean views to create an infinity pool masterpiece, they’ve hidden it in the bushes. No atmosphere, no view—just an uninspired, lifeless pool area that feels like an afterthought.

5. No Proper Pool Bar – Just a Slow, Overworked Server on a Bicycle.

Want a drink by the pool? Be prepared to wait an eternity. There’s no real bar—just a lone staff member who has to bike over to fetch your order. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a beer or soda. If you want anything more complex—good luck.

6. The Dining Room? A Glass Prison.

Whoever designed the main restaurant must have hated nature, because instead of making the most of the setting, they shoved it inside a glass aquarium with AC. You can technically dine outside, but space is ridiculously limited. It’s a total mystery why a resort that markets itself as an “immersive nature retreat” has such an unwelcoming, uninspired dining experience.

7. The Food? Decent, but Laughably Boring.

For a so-called high-end resort, the lack of imagination in the menu is astonishing. And the ultimate insult? The ice cream selection: Vanilla and Chocolate. That’s it. In a country famous for tropical fruits, that’s all they could come up with?

FINAL VERDICT: A LUXURY RESORT IN NAME ONLY

Would UGA Chena Huts ever be a real five-star resort? Yes—IF the owners actually invested in it.

• The dining area? Rip out that dreadful glass box and open it up to the surroundings.

• The main pool? Move it, make it an infinity pool with ocean views, and give it a proper bar. Surround the bar and the “ new Dining area “ with an infinity pool ! Just copy what they have masterfully done elsewhere - like The Wild Coast Tented lodge 5 minutes away.

• The huts? Renovate them with actual luxury in mind, instead of letting them rot in outdated mediocrity.

• The plunge pools? Tear them out and build something worthy of the price you are  charging.

Right now, this place is a a bit of a joke. Upscale travelers aren’t stupid—they know when they’re being overcharged for mediocrity. If you want to throw your money at a subpar three-star resort disguised as a five-star experience, be my guest. But if you’re looking for true luxury, look elsewhere.","5 Star Price Tag for a 3 Star resort - issues that could so easily be fixed with money and more imagination.","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r995344051-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Unfortunately, the reality fell short of our expectations, especially considering the exorbitant price tag attached. For the same price, we could have enjoyed five days at equally stunning hotels across Sri Lanka.
From the start, things were off to a rocky start. Arriving at the resort was complicated, and surprisingly, there was no provision for a transfer to the hotel. We had to request one upon our return, which added unnecessary hassle to our trip. In a luxury establishment, such basic conveniences should be anticipated, not merely accommodated upon request.
As for the birthday celebration, the only acknowledgment we received was a predictable cake with a candle. While a nice gesture, it hardly lived up to the expectation of making the day truly special. We expected more thoughtful gestures and personalized attention given the occasion.
The food at the resort was decent, albeit limited to a fixed menu rather than à la carte options. Breakfast was the highlight, offering a variety of delicious options. However, the lack of flexibility in dining choices was disappointing for a luxury establishment.
We opted to go on a morning safari from 6 to 9 a.m., expecting an immersive wildlife experience. However, the three-hour duration felt excessive, especially when the animal sightings were sparse. Additionally, the safari vehicle provided was not up to the standards one would expect from a luxury hotel, and the snack provided was underwhelming.
Even the minibar in our room failed to meet expectations for the price paid. The overall demeanor of the staff seemed forced and inconsistent, lacking the genuine warmth and attentiveness one would expect from a luxury resort.
In summary, while the resort offers some amenities and comforts, it ultimately fails to justify the steep price tag. The lack of attention to detail, underwhelming experiences, and inconsistent service make it difficult to recommend this resort to discerning travelers seeking true luxury and value for their money.","The overall experience doesn’t justify the price","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r942718442-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for choosing to stay with us.  I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your villa and the private pool, and I hope I can clarify a few concerns you had during your stay. 

As an all-inclusive resort, we offer all meals within the resort restaurant and the menu is changed daily. We do regret if the day’s option was not to your liking, had this been brought to our attention our chef would have been more than glad to assist in preparing a dish of your preference.. 

Safety of our guests is an utmost priority and we do have a strike policy on discouraging guest to swim in the ocean as this part of the sea is not swimmable due to the heavy currents. Venturing along the beach is also dangerous as it frequented by Elephants and other wild animals. 

We assure you are rangers are well trained, experienced and passionate, they would in no way act in a manner that would be inappropriate causing harm to the wildlife and the surroundings and do take alternate routes whenever possible in order to avoid overcrowded areas of the park. 

We thank you for your patronage, we look forward to welcoming you back to Chena Huts when you do return to Sri Lanka.

Rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and come with cosy outdoor private pools but..

Food is average and meagre (as it is an all inclusive resort you have no other choice but to dine in the hotel), it is forbidden to swim in the sea as it is too dangerous (heads up - this is not mentioned on Uga's website), there were local men playing cricket just outside of our hut (so much for the security and the privacy of the resort), private road leading to the resort (according to Uga's website: ""specially built"") is in terrible state (any car that is not 4 x 4 will struggle) and finally the biggest disappointment (and the main reason why we booked this place) was the complimentary safari.

Park itself is beautiful but we were bitterly disappointed with Uga's and park's rangers. During our safari visit we saw one poor elephant on the road surrounded by dozen of trucks so tourists could take a photo of it. Despite having two rangers just in our track, the driver would still pass the elephant several times and the hotel's ranger would laugh when the elephant got irritated with our and other trucks passing. It was very sad to see that drivers nor rangers cared about the wellbeing of the elephant. Also Yala park doesn't regulate how many tracks can enter the park and to add insult to injury most of the trucks we saw weren't even fully occupied.

We probably should've done more research before we booked this hotel and visited Yala park but if we knew more about the actual safari and the fact that you can't swim in the ocean we wouldn't stay in this place.

We haven’t been to South Africa on a safari and are considering it for part of our honeymoon, so Uga Chena and Yala were going to be our first tastes to this type of experience. Obviously Uga Chena comes at a steep price per night, so our expectations were very high. 

Check-in- We were greeted with a very warm welcome by the staff where they have you put in the flag of your country on their welcome board. For a small intimate place, it’s nice to know where the other guests are from. Nice touch. 

Rooms- Spacious and impressive. We immediately put on our bathing suits and took advantage of our private pool. There were saw water buffalo in the distance as our room over looked out to a watering hole. So cool! Beds were comfortable and amenities like the bathtub were special touches. 

All-inclusive- This is a point where we felt we did not get the true value of an all inclusive experience. Our mini bar was stocked with sugary drinks, water, and sodas, but NO alcohol! Not even canned beer. On a hot day all we wanted was a cold drink in the pool. So we called the front desk and asked for a bottle of wine to our room. They said no room service since there is wildlife very close to the property, but we could come to the bar, get a glass of wine, then bring it back to our room. Huh? So it’s okay if we drink at our pool, but we have to inconvenience ourselves to get out of the pool to order it at the bar, then head back.... At that point if I can bring wine back to my room myself, then the staff should be able to do it as well. That is definitely not 5-star service, and frankly contradicts their policy. **I’m not talking about food here because I 100% understand why there is no food allowed in the huts. I am simply referring to drinks. 

Staff- Very friendly and strive to make sure you are “okay” at all times. They want to make sure you are happy and having a good experience, but lack the power at times to actually make sure this happens. My fiancé had e-mailed the staff ahead of time letting them know that we were celebrating our anniversary, and they were so excited to bring us a cake with sparklers to celebrate. These were warm and thoughtful touches that we commend them for. 

Spa- My fiancé and I got a 1-hour full body massage and both thoroughly enjoyed them.

Safari- Two game drives a day are included in your nightly rate, which is a seamless perk of staying at Uga Chena Huts. Kasun was our game driver and we would highly recommend him! We only did two game drives: one early morning and one late afternoon. Most people do a minimum of four game drives, but for us two was enough to get a taste of Yala. Kasun was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about wild life, especially elephants. Sadly, we didn’t get to see the famous leopards, but by no means did that took away from our wonderful safari experience. We saw elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, king fisher, painted storks, eagles, lizards, wild hogs, baby hogs, etc. It was so relaxing to just park at a watering hole and watch nature in real time. After our last game drive Kasun spoke with us in more detail about leopard and elephant behavior. He was amazing and a true highlight of our stay at Uga Chena!

Safety- My issues with safety are similar to my issues with the no room service policy—their policies 100% make sense, but they aren’t necessarily consistent i.e. we could get drinks at the bar and bring them back to our room to drink at the pool, but their staff couldn’t bring them to us because they have a no room service policy. That makes no sense. Anyways, back to the safety issue. They definitely take safety seriously. They do not allow you to walk to the beach without a staff member guiding you. One night the staff had coordinated my fiancé and I to eat a private meal on the beach where wildlife passes by regularly, but canceled it because there was an elephant nearby. All great safety measures that we appreciated. That night at dinner one of the waiters told us that there was a leopard spotted at Hut 14. But here’s the kicker: you are able to walk alone at night from the restaurant to your hut and vice versa! When there are leopards! It is also very dark along these paths and I personally felt very uncomfortable that an animal (even a monkey) would pop out from the bushes at any moment. I feel like the staff should always offer to walk you back to your hut in these situations.  

All in all, we enjoyed our game drive with Kasun and the amenities in our room, but sadly left feeling disappointed in the experience we received for the $1,000/ night price tag. It would be may more accurately priced at $600/ night. Also, we only stayed one night and truly felt if we stayed any longer we would have gone stir crazy. Definite room for improvement here!","Overpriced and not up to standard of quality","2017-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r521082795-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

We are happy to note that that your overall experience at Chena Huts was good and thank you for taking time off to review.

Regret to note that you were not entirely satisfied with your safari to the Yala National Park. This cannot be compared to safaris in Africa where there are open plains starching across a vast area of open terrain with abundance of wild life which Africa has to offer.  Yala National park is unique in its own way which is renowned for its high-density of Leopard population.

We hope you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

The jeep tracks are very badly maintained and the ride along them is painful. Most tracks are close to thick undergrowth, so mostly there is precious little to see.

- I would not call it a luxury resort. Small little things give it out whether it's the quality of toiletries or the bar or small TV hanging on the wall. No need for a TV in Hatton. 
- having a Badminton courtyard to pool table in the middle of Hatton also shows that it's focus is to cater to local crowd rather than foreign tourists. Hence may be less than 20% were foreigners in the resort the time we were around. 
- food - while they were really accomodative but I am not sure if this is the best. Maybe we are vegetarian and we struggled. But must say that they went out of the way to support. Full marks on that.

Instead on the website it’s in the middle of the paddy fields. But in reality you see nothing but trees not even nice to see them. And then there’s no difference between the 1st category villas and the second category villas a part from the bath tub and one extra toilet. In my opinion not worth paying that much to get only these two things and these villas were too far from the main hall and restaurant. But if anyone looking for a calm, quiet and privacy then this villa is the best choice. Other than that I recommend to anyone who wants visit this hotel go for the cheaper one. 

Food: Sadly food quality was very low for the standard of this hotel. Only three course meal been served for people who are on BB, HB or FB basis. Dessert options were same for both lunch and dinner. Very few options of foods. A la carte menu prices were too high. Definitely needs to be improved. Specially for locals. 

The other thing is check the period before you travel if you wanna see the green. Because a week before our stay paddy fields been all harvested. So it was all dry and dull.

The extensive Uga property is delightfully planned to provide a totally unique experience – this was our second 3-day stay.  Accommodation is provided in superbly appointed, spacious villas, with deck and well-sized plunge pool.  Villa maintenance is good.  A buggy service is provided to transport guests to the Main House (some drivers need to drive at an appropriate speed for the somewhat uneven terrain!).  The Main House is enchanting with splendid lounge / bar area, scenically sited to enjoy the pool and array of Frangipan trees.  However, one of the two restaurants was ‘closed for renovation’ and the à la carte menu of the other is very limited.  For a 3-day stay, one struggles to find acceptable items.  Further, the quality of the meals was very mediocre and prices were high.  This was a disappointment for a hotel of this standing.  Breakfasts were good.

We had a deluxe one Bedroom Villa, which on the website looks amazing! Sadly it was not as amazing as it looked. The Villa is very rustic and colonial again like so many which we really like, the bed was comfortable, the shower was not great and we did ask them to try to fix it as the pressure was terrible and would come on and off at different pressures thought-out the shower, it was very ""rusty"" and old looking as were a lot of the bathroom facilities They did improve it but still, it was not great (The worse in all our hotels in Sri Lanka) We had to ask them to fix the toilet seat twice as it kept slamming down (Supposed to be soft closing, which they did replace on our final few days. The pool was very cold and I could not use it. sadly, my husband did brave it! We were quite away from the main house so had breakfast sent each morning which was very nice and presented well. The food was included in our stay just the Alcohol we had to pay for which was severely overpriced! The rose Wine which we love was so sweet and the white was average I had to resort to the Oyster Bay at £60 pounds a bottle !!! The food was ok, we do enjoy the Sri lanken food so eat mostly the curries, and we did enjoy the KAMATHA Diner in the Mud hut which was a slightly added cost but not too much considering the amount of food you got! 
We went on the safari with Katherina, who was lovely and well informed, we saw ""one"" elephant and a few Serpent Eagles I wished I had not got up at 4 am to do this as it was so not worth the effort,! But not their fault as you never know what you might see! The staff were very helpful and the Assistant Front desk Manager Seshaya was super and really tried to get things done for us. As we left we told the General Manager, Thashinthan, our thoughts regarding the cost of the wine and the general condition of the villa, so I do hope they take action and up their game as after coming from W15 it was hard to come down to the lower standards provided at Uga considering the cost of staying there. I would not recommend it at the present but maybe if they improve things it would be better.","Our Number 5 Hotel on Sri Lanka Tour","2022-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2335977-d1876504-r829096806-Uga_Ulagalla-Thirappane_North_Central_Province.html",

This was beautifully furnished and surrounded by wild life and plants, but about 8 minutes away from the main dining room and pool by buggy. We were told we just had to dial 0 and the buggy would arrive. The first night the phone had no dialling tone, luckily after about 20 minutes of wondering what to do, the man turned up to do the evening turn down service and eventually got through on his mobile so about another 20 minutes later we got to dinner. For breakfast the next day, the phone worked, but unfortunately the buggy broke down so after about 25 minutes we got to breakfast! After that it worked fairly efficiently but one was always fairly unsure. The dining room was the main problem though. The service was totally erratic.  Sometimes you got bread and water as you sat down, sometimes, the table next to you who came in later than you got bread and water and you didn’t. Sometimes you got an “amuse bouche” sometimes you didn’t. The food was not very good either.

It’s set in 58 acres of land, mostly forest some paddy fields and a few small ponds/lakes. We were a group of 6 and stayed in 2 chalets. The chalets itself were lovely, beautifully decorated, fantastic views over paddy fields or forest and very comfortable. Some rooms come with a plunge pool. To get around the hotel you can cycle or use a golf buggy from reception. We opted for the cycles except at night. The grounds are a haven for some wonderful tropical birds. We spotted quite a few extraordinarily colourful ones including the Ceylon jungle fowl and many peacocks. The hotel pool is great too. We also used the pool table and did archery- which is charged for. 

Now the reason for the 3 stars... sadly for a hotel of this class the food was a real let down. It’s a set menu - which is not a problem but the food didn’t live up to expectations of a hotel of this class. Also the same menu was given for both lunch and dinner and over 2 days! Desserts were worse than the mains. 

The service was somewhat hit and miss too. Some of the main staff were very robotic almost and we all felt were not very genuine. Where as others like one waiter and some of the ground staff and security were very nice indeed. 

Also there was a mouse in our room!! 

All in all we had a good break.. would we come again? I’d like to think that maybe one day we would. But there certainly are some issues with this hotel and for the prices they charge and the way they portray themselves some serious changes need to be made.

Thank you for your stay at Ulagalla and for taking the time off to post a review. We are very pleased to know that you found the resort to be beautiful and you were very happy with luxurious accommodation. 
While our culinary experience offered is highly appreciated, it is unfortunate that in this instance we could not entirely satisfy you. We regret that the wine of your choice was not available and sold out. This is not acceptable and corrective action is being rolled out.

We do sincerely hope that the overall experience was positive and the memories of your stay will give us the opportunity of welcoming you back to Ulagalla.

Ours was luxurious and the distance from the main building no problem as we enjoyed cycling over on the bikes provided. The food was good, but not as good as we enjoyed elsewhere in Sri Lanka as it somehow just lacked the final touch. 
However what rather spoiled our stay was an issue with the wine list. There are 6 whites listed but three had run out. We had decided to treat ourselves to a Chardonnay from Margaret River to find there was none left so we were offered one from Chile as an alternative. Foolishly I did not ask the price so we ended up being charged the price of the Margaret River wine (9600 rupees plus service plus tax so well over £50 GBP) for a very average bottle. When I queried this on the bill it was greeted with a shrug and a waiter who could not escape fast enough!

The situation is remarkable and my husband and I enjoyed the nature and wild life.  Our room was good and comfy, but you needed a degree in electronics to get everything working or indeed turned off!  

The food was disappointing - the curries all tasted similar, service was slow and for a 5 star hotel it was not good enough. Breakfast was fine.

Regrettably our friends suffered badly by being in Villa 4.  Air conditioning was not working, the lock didn't work properly.  There had recently been a power strike before our arrival and the electronic screen to control everything wasn't working either.  This should have been checked and repaired before their arrival.  Interestingly, looking back in the comments book in Villa 4.  There are a number of comments about poorly working air conditioning, no wifi, and a number of other difficulties.  Clearly this room needs some upgrading which in spite of comments they have failed to do.

The staff were on the whole very good, but one or two of them were frankly pretty useless and some more staff training is needed in order to justify its Small Luxury Hotel of the World status.

The swimming pool area was lovely and the whole setting fabulous.  We walked and used the bikes, and, of course it is well positioned for seeing Anuradnupura. 

With a bit of tweaking this hotel could be truly wonderful and I am glad that others have enjoyed it - maybe we were just unlucky.

A beautifully restored reception hall with the restaurant on the first floor giving a fabulous view of the gorgeous pool, the manicured lawns and the distant paddy fields. The individual villas with private plunge pools and large living area and bedroom are  also beautifully presented.
It's not until you actually start to use the facilities that the cracks appear. The bathroom is large, but the open shower is badly built and the water is always in danger of flooding the floor. The shower head itself is too close to the edge of the shower area and soaks the floor, the towels, the bathmat and anything else within reach.
There is a shaving/make up mirror but the lighting is so poor it's useless. The resort is eco friendly, so the towels and grey and hard. Now I'm all in favour of saving the planet, but give me fluffy white towels any day.
The room service is erratic. The first night we had lovely candles in the bathroom, the second night no candles and the mini bar was not restocked and glasses were not replaced.
But by far the most disappointing thing was the food. Very bland and ordinary. We saw three people return their food, ours was OK but certainly not the standard you would expect. As I have already said, the views are wonderful but the food is not.
The service at breakfast is painfully slow. Everything is waitress served so you wait for the fruit juice, wait for the cereals, wait for the fruit and eventually get your eggs, in my case served at the same time as the fruit. We had FIVE incorrect things served in two days. The first breakfast took 45 minutes with our driver waiting outside. Why don't you have a buffet table for the juices and fruit and cereal like everyone else, it would speed things up enormously and there would be less wastage as your portions are very large.
The villas are so far spread over several acres so they have a golf buggy to ferry you around. That's ok except at busy times such as breakfast or checkout time, but there appears to be just one grandfather figure who controls everything and the delays are very frustrating.
All small things but it wouldn't take much to get everything to a much higher standard.","A lack of attention to details stops this being an excellent resort.","2016-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2335977-d1876504-r351770096-Uga_Ulagalla-Thirappane_North_Central_Province.html",

Thank you very much for this feedback and we are extremely glad you enjoyed the surroundings and services offered at Ulagalla.  

We are located just outside of Anuradhapura within a 58 acre property surrounded by paddy fields, natural woodlands and lakes. Therefore while the location is remote it provides for an excellent experience that is close to nature.  Due to these very surroundings that our property and villas are located in, peacocks, monkeys, exotic birds as well as geckos are spotted in the vicinity.  However I believe that our staff informs all guests to be mindful when leaving the room and to always keep the room doors shut in order avoid attracting any unwanted visitors such as geckos to your rooms.  

We do hope you enjoyed your stay with us as much as we enjoyed having you at Ulagalla and we sincerely look forward to welcome you back to our property.

Please allow us to clarify that the Mini Bar charges that you are referring to.

They never have access to a field to freely run around and graze grass. After observing them closeby, the black horse had injuries at each knee (caused most likely by laying down on concrete to sleep) and the white and black horse had a lot of scars all over his body. After some investigation, we’ve been told that the two young smiling stable hands beat them.

After having complained to the general manager, asking him to provide straw in the stables, to put the horses in a field at least several hours a day and to replace the young boys who beat the horses, he only had a thin layer of sawdust put on the floor. 
The manager claimed to be unable to improve the condition of these animals because they are owned and being provided by a company called Premadasa Riding School Sri Lanka which is said to be responsible for the conditions these horses are kept in. 

Here are the photos we made in Ulagalla Resort in August 2013.

It is extremely unfortunate that you did not experience the same level of service as Tea Trails, as the seamless thread of service is something a number of our guests write about. We have some of the best rangers in Sri Lanka, and the overall safari experience is certainly one of the highlights. Suranga, along with the rest of the team are incredibly proficient in explaining what you see at Yala, and educating you about the bio-diversity in the region. In terms of the rooms, the family rooms are connected via a small bridged walkway. This connected 'urchin' is very popular among all families that visit, and this form of design was implemented to keep in line with building standards and sustainability principles in order to not exceed a specific tent size. 

We have already completed an inquiry on why the restaurant service on that particular day was not up to your satisfaction. We always strive to improve and we appreciate your feedback in regard to this matter. Your comment about Tea Trails being rated 11/10 is something we truly appreciate, and next time you visit, you can be assured that you will experience the same level of hospitality at Wild Coast.

But I agree that with some of the recent reviewers that management and service are not up to Ceylon Tea Trail standards (where we stayed immediately before Wild Trails). Upon arrival as an all-inclusive guest, you are given a confusing set of instructions of what exactly is included in your 'all inclusive' experience (three pieces of laundry per day and four drinks, for example). This comes across as cheap and unnecessary and the opposite of what one should feel upon arrival.

But our biggest problem with the hotel was its heavy-handed use of security to restrict guests' movements around the hotel. You are only permitted to walk on a sliver of the beach, and you are not permitted to leave your room without an escort after dark. If you do so, security is aggressive. 

I'm sure that the hotel will say that they are protecting their guests' safety, but the truth is that incoming guests are in far more danger in the car getting to the hotel than they are once they are on the grounds. We've traveled to many places worldwide with dangerous wildlife and have never experienced an obtrusive management experience like this. Our sense was that the hotel's paternalistic approach had everything to do with a corporate approach to a wildlife lodge that aimed to limit liability and was happy to whitewash the experience for guests. Until management loosens up some of these policies, this is not the best place for more adventurous travelers or for those who value their privacy.","Management and service need work","2019-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r662305386-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

I’m glad that you enjoyed the service and food at Wild Coast. But not the game drives – for which please accept my apologies. I’ve gone into the matters raised and checked records:

Our policy is that kids below 3 are not allowed on a game drive, we made an exception at your insistence although we advised against taking an infant and suggested that one parent stays back for each of the drives. We will communicate this policy more clearly going forward, my apologies if we didn’t inform you when booking.

We work with the local community, using carefully selected Toyota 4WD safari jeeps accompanied by our rangers. Ranger Keith had conveyed your specific request for a driver from Sugatha Safari’s and we booked driver Kalu from that company, who we have accredited. Kalu was waiting for you at 0615 for the drive - we don’t “forget” guests on game drives! It appears you wanted a different driver from the same company, Sumudu, who is not on our accredited list. Sumudu was also waiting for you, having been directly contacted. Kalu was dismissed and you did the game drive with Sumudu and we paid Sugatha Safari’s

Our rangers strive to offer a holistic experience of Yala and are highly rated – in this case an unusual confluence of events resulted in a misunderstanding for which I apologise although I do believe you have been unjust with your comments.I am happy to share copies of rosters and vehicle movements if you require, please do message me.

However the service experience needs a lot of work starting from the rangers. No one contacted us pre arrival to even inquire about what time we were to be expected etc.

The food was good, the presentation excellent. The head chef went out of his way to ensure we were happy after each meal and to offer to make us things we liked to eat. The F&B Service staff were good and nothing was too much for them to handle. The cocktails by the pool were lovely and the bartender was only too happy to oblige. Lilanga and his team really made our stay a pleasant one. Overall the service staff at the hotel; from the boys walking us to our cocoons in the night, the receptionists, the room service guys and the housekeeping boys were very courteous and obliging.

Our game drives were a disaster from the get go. We travelled with an infant and the senior ranger Nick immediately scared our friends by saying their daughter would likely have a ""heart attack"" on seeing an elephant. Not for a moment did he inquire if our friends were comfortable with taking their daughter on a game drive but continued to ramble on and on about company policy and that they would be charged extra for a private jeep in case the infant had a ""heart attack"". We realised that this was because game drives are shared with other guests. Luckily for us we were a group of 5 travelling with the infant, only to mention that we were happy to simply travel together. At no time in the 5 minute conversation did he even ask about our interests for the next mornings drive because when sharing jeeps, it is the hotels responsibility to match the interests of all travellers within a particular jeep. A very sad state of affairs for a head ranger from South Africa.

My husband requested a particular jeep driver for the next morning after being told that all the jeeps were brought in from the local neighbourhoods and was told by Keith (a ranger) that the request was fine and that all was organised for the morning drive. Come morning, there was no sign of the requested driver and jeep and my husband went ahead and called him personally only to be told that he hadn't been booked as promised the evening prior. In the end, we called and organised our own jeep from outside as the game drive coordinator had completely forgotten us in his roster. They were only too happy to inform us that we would have to pay for our own game drive as the jeep and the driver was not on their roster. 

The ranger team needs to realise that paying guests are just that, no matter if they are Sri Lankan or foreign guests. A few trainings in South Africa within exclusive tented lodges and private game reserves will surely be an eye opener to the ranger staff at Wild Coast Tented Lodge about how to treat guests, clearly Nick and his team have no clue!!

Yala has so much to offer, not to mention competing hotel offerings and a company of this stature, should only offer the very best of Sri Lankan hospitality.

1. Wifi was shoddy to non-existent in our room and I had to come to the main lobby area to use my laptop - and I was getting devoured by mosquitoes when that happened.

2. Some staff at the buffet area need better training. I had a couple of incidents that didn’t happen at the other resorts we stayed at: my eggs at the egg station being given to another patron and then coffee I ordered simply not showing up.

3. Lighting in the rooms is less than ideal if you need to work on the desk, but fortunately they were able to bring in a lamp to suit my purposes.

On the positive side:

1. Staff is very helpful if you ask them for anything, so don’t hesitate. The chef was able to accommodate my wife’s request for special curries for our lunch the next day after checking in.

2. The central pool overlooking the ocean is magnificent and jaw dropping.

3. Rooms are quite spacious and have a really open feeling.

But since I saw a few hotel deals and I badly wanted a break I thought I'd take this up again. Need to say that the service this time was way better than the last time. Got my room on time, the amenities, staff were really good and friendly. Enjoyed my stay.

But I also need to mention that there's definitely more space to improve. Listing them down here.. 
1) lighting at night. The hotel seems a bit too dark at night with minimum lighting. Specially at night the lobby and dining area looks very dull
2) more trees and greens around the pool area
3) more interaction with the in-house guests (activities)
4) music/entertainment is a must. The hotel felt a bit too lonely and silent
5) games for familes to engage (i.e.: card games, pool table, board games etc) and even activities for kids
6) the entire atmosphere could be a bit more lively

It's quite minimalistic and sparse. The beach is lovely here though.  They could do with revamping the pool area and having a nicer atmosphere. Poolmosdalt water also. Not an issue for me, but might be for others. The place was deserted when we were there. Which was nice in some ways, but awkward in others. The service at meal times was pleasant, but a bit too fussy and always coming back and forth to the table and not letting you relax and have some peace and quiet. The beverages are quite expensive and so is the food. The buffet dinner was good though and a nice big selection. Which we felt terrible about, since it was just a few guests, with so much food prepared. 
The wifi in the place was very patchy and kept dropping out. Mostly with the in-room wifi. 
The bedroom itself was fairly small.and there was lack any plug sockets next to the bed. Which always annoys me and makes no sense. 
The bathroom was huge and clean. Although the bathroom and shower backed up to where alot of staff would chat and make noise. 
I was surprised that a lot of the staffs English was quite poor. Some simple requests and questions, were met with confusion. 
Overall, its friendly service for the most part. Restraunt staff are very nice. 
The place just needs something else added around the grounds of the pool to create a nicer feel. ","Lacking of atmosphere and minimalistic.

If you are booking the panaromic suite ask for the direct sea view since the one we stayed we can only see a part of the ocean. 

One more thing the hotel can improve is on the panaromic suite you get private pool for 4 rooms some guest get in to the pool with  proper swimming wear.

Thank you for posting a constructive review on TripAdvisor following your stay with us. We are happy to hear you were pleased with the room and amenities.

Our Sincere apologies for the inconveniences caused with food. The statement “recycled the food every day and re-cooked dozens of times” is inaccurate which surprised as it is one of our main concerns and a major factor to differ us from others which has resulted in more and more repeater clients along with lots of positive comments.

Further I wish to state that, generally all the hotels charged supplement for the Christmas Dinner. Hence, my FOM informed to you. which might have misunderstood being forced to you.

We do regret that your stay was with us was not as you would have expected it to be. However, your review leaves us concerned as it's riddled with inaccuracies and I will surely look into the matter of the points as mentioned by you.

Would never imagine to have such a horrible bed even at a budget motel. The air conditioners were very outdated and malfunctioning as well. The so-called buffet is a huge scam. The food is recycled every day, just with minor modifications to make it look slightly different. Not one thing in their spread was fresh. The seafood was absolutely tasteless, and must have been re-cooked dozens of times. I was unfortunate enough to stay there on the 23rd of December and decided to extend my stay for another night (Xmas Eve). Apparently they have a ""Xmas party"" for which each guest is FORCED to pay LKR 5,500 irrespective of whether you want to participate or not. So our family of four was charged LKR 22,000 which is almost another night's stay. The least they could give us in return is a decent Xmas celebration but alas! It was a complete mockery. They served us a so-called special buffet which was once again nothing but recycled food. We got absolutely nothing else! They came around asking each table to purchase tickets for the raffle draw, despite having already paid so much and receiving nothing in return. We were even charged extra for the water we consumed, which was once again left on our table, opened and poured into our glasses before we even arrived. We had no idea we would be charged until we got the bill. This so-called party consisted of a god-forsaken choir singing a few carols and then a supposed DJ playing a few outdated songs. We fell asleep at our table, couldn't stand it anymore and left to our room. At the end of it all, their so-called ""fireworks on the beach""  was just a few fire sparklers they lit up.

There was a friendly atmosphere portrayed throughout our stay from each and every team member. Have to give credit to Pathum who served us well during our breakfast meal.

We checked in to the double deluxe rooms. They were flexible with our request to change rooms to the upper level for a better view. Room service was great, there was a prompt response! They were very generous with amenities.

The view of the pool from the entrance was fabulous. We were totally psyched with the photos taken.

However, we were disappointed with the meals. Having checked in on a full board basis, none of our meals consisted of a buffet! As I was walking in for the meals I could see the “Tandoor” which is used to make naan bread. But not there on the menu we had!

The four-course menu was not appealing at all to me! So much so that during lunch I was left hungry after the Bolognese Pasta serve. I literally had to ask them for another meal because I did not want to leave hungry after enjoying in the pool for over 2 hours. The staff was quick to get me another meal of my choice. 

Overall it was a highly lucrative offer (full board 1-night stay on a double deluxe). Although we were not entirely satisfied with the food menu and I would rate it average. We were having high expectation on the meals since we came a long way from Kandy and most us were foodies :) 

Either way I would still recommend this place to anyone who would like to come over to Pasikudah and enjoy the beach view, surroundings and the hotel facilities they have on offer :)","Our family get away trip","2018-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r632540128-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

I first visited the beautiful sea resort on 2014. After that I have visited twice to Malu Malu. At the same time, I was holidaying with almost all other resorts surrounded in magnificent Pasikudda beach.  
 
All other surrounded resorts have caught up malu malu during last 4 years and Malu Malu Aura has faded and surrounded resorts have lifted the bar. 

Panoramic view is not Panoramic  

Last holiday in June 2018 at Malu Malu was not a stay I would cherish. It all started with reservation conversation over the phone. Reservation officer kept me hold twice for more than 3 minutes during the reservation call in order to answer in coming other calls. He kept arguing with me and reasoning out not being able to reserve upstairs room for my stay.  Ultimately in order to make sure that I get up stair room I had to reserve panoramic view room which is expensive. The worst was that panoramic view room which has been offered to us was covered with coconut trees which is blocking 120 degree of the view.

Professionalism and experience required in service 

Staff is very friendly however it was evident that they lack experience and professionalism. Hotel management seems to be less enthusiastic and lack in experience and professionalism.  resort management in terms of site look, maintenance and building quality getting deteriorate as with the years. 

Food is not the best 

During our stay (3 nights) we have experienced that no variance in food served. similar set of items being served for every day.

Service is mixed though, even though the staff were friendly. When we arrived we had to wait for a full hour to be able to check in - no real communication from the desk what was going on and why - at some point we just went to eat (1 star deducted). 

During our stay the Spa was closed one day for cleaning. The manager was very apologetic and gave us each a free massage, so it was made up. There is a free morning yoga session - we went only to find the teacher had a day off (not great if you are getting up for it at 7am, another star deducted) but on the second day when it did happen it was great.
We felt the buffet was nice with a good spread of choice but when the guest numbers dropped there was only a la carte which was pretty average. The dining area is a bit tired and it would be much nicer to be able to eat nearer the beach, at least in the evening when it is not so hot (would be impossible for lunch as it had 35 degrees).
The staff are very friendly so nothing to fault there, but overall the experience was average.

The pool is nice to look at, but shallow when you get in. The beach itself looks better in pictures and is also shallow when you get in the water.
Food wise - the dinner buffet was average enough, breakfast had a lot more options and was of a higher quality of food.
Location wise the hotel isn't really near anything, perfect if you want to be isolated from everything.
The biggest downside of this hotel is the decor used in the rooms and even in the bar area. Seriously out-dated and uses bizarre colours.

Yes the place is a relatively quiet sanctuary from the noise and bustle of Kandy centre, but my wife and I thought the food was poor and the room was bland with no view to speak of - we had a suite which essentially looked out over a small rear lawn and trees beyond.

The pool area was okay but because the weather wasn’t great we didn’t get to use it. 

The room itself was comfortable if basic and had limited storage space, with a single cupboard in a room that could have accommodated much more.

The staff were helpful and friendly and did everything they could to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable but at times they became an intrusive nuisance spoiling any chance of relaxing in the common areas as you always felt you were being watched. With only about 8 or so rooms and quite a few staff they always seemed to be looking for something to do or someone to watch.

We had dinner there once which was pretty average at best - not a great ambience and at night not much of a view. The breakfast was okay, but the bread basket included toast that was hard and brittle - a sure sign the bread has been frozen and then placed in the toaster. We did order room service and I can say the chicken burger I ordered was without doubt the worst I had ever had anywhere. The bun was rock hard and the chicken was mushy and tasteless. The food menu was also relatively expensive in our opinion.

The standout contribution was from the resident Tuk Tuk driver who took us to the botanic gardens (well worth a visit), and later took us to a restaurant in town for dinner. He was fantastic.","Not a 5 star experience","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d11925680-r992605330-Kings_Pavilion-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

For example the Anantara Peace Haven, which many reviewers feel has high prices for food and drinks, charges about half as much for cocktails and other alcoholic drinks and we found the prices there very fair compared to Kings Pavilion.  

We arrived to a really lovely welcome with a cold towel and welcome drink.  We were promptly shown to our room and enjoyed the welcome amenities including chocolates.  When we wanted to go to Kandy the staff quickly organised a very good and inexpensive tuk tuk driver for us and reminded us of the requirement for  covering up at the Temple of the Tooth which was very kind and welcome information.  

The turndown service was also excellent.  We received more chocolates and beautiful towel art decorated our beds which was a lovely surprise.

When we went to dinner, again staff were very engaging and kind. However, being on half board meant  having a very limited menu to choose from.  Drinks other than Fanta or Coke were outrageously priced for Sri Lanka. In nearly 3 weeks travelling through Sri Lanka staying at high end hotels all along, prices here were by far the highest.  Needless to say we stuck to soft drinks.   Although the food was good, I would advise against taking the half board option, as you are stuck with a limited choice and very high drinks prices.  By leaving it open where you have dinner you could still choose to eat here and have the full menu to select from.

Breakfast was very good and we were offered a second helping of any fruit or breakfast items that we particularly liked - this again was great service.

Our room was a suite and located in a separate building behind the main structure.  The bathroom was huge and very well appointed, but the room itself was a bit of a let down.  While large in size, the pieces of furniture did not seem high quality and were mismatched.  The room itself reminded me of a motel room somehow, the decor seemed poorly finished and the door seemed old and had a huge gap at the bottom which allowed a large caterpillar to gain access during the night. All in all the least impressive room we had during our trip and the only hotel were I felt that bugs could easily get into the room. The staircase that leads up to this annex was overgrown with plants. While I largely avoided getting bitten by mosquitos in Sri Lanka, I did get a few bites here.  The patio area outside our room did not look inviting either, it wasn't paved but you walked out onto soil and a small amount of grass, there was no view to speak of. It is possible that other rooms offer a better standard as they seem to be of individual character and some seemed to be looking out over Kandy. However, the greedy drinks prices alone would deter me from staying again.","Poor value for money","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d11925680-r969990324-Kings_Pavilion-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The Kings Pavillion was our third hotel - and, unfortunately, the least excellent one during our holidays. 
The service was fine and friendly but not as welcoming and heartful as in other destinations. One morning, we had a really tight timing and let every one know in advance so the staff could prepare (we wanted to pre-order which we were told was not necessary). When we arrived at 7 am for breakfast as announced - no one was there and it took another 15 minutes before we could finally start breakfast. 

We had two junior suites; they were perfectly clean and we really liked the animal towel contructions! :-) 
However, there was only one small cupboard in our room with no room for hanging longer clothes, like dresses. 

The food was good but not exceptional - small surprise: butter and jam for breakfast were single-packed products. We did expect more in a 5 star hotel (which was confirmed by what we got in other places we stayed).","Everything was fine but nothing special!","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d11925680-r945843930-Kings_Pavilion-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Previous to our stay we did our research and were impressed by the positive reviews. Unfortunately, we can only share part of the enthusiasm. 

Let me beginn with the good part: We did enjoy the colonial, old property, the well-preserved antiques, the quietness of its setting and its amazingly good Sri Lankan cuisine. We were also pampered by all members of the staff and especially by Thamara, who went out of his way to make our stay unique and help with my sick husband.

Now on to the not so good part: based on our previous experiences in Sri Lanka in equally comparable properties (also ancient, colonial houses, some of them also old plantation estates, all of them equally luxurious, some also on half board basis, and all of them in comparable isollated natural settings) we found it terribly overpriced and found their payment policy (cash only) odd to say the least. 

A reason why we might be more critical than other guests is because we visit it at the end of our trip, not at the beginning. Most people visit the Horathapola Estate at the beginning of their journey and I can see why you would be amaze in this case. We on the other side had visited several other properties (in Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Ella, Koslanda, Galle, Hikkaduwa and Induruwa) that could perfectly compete with Horathapola's luxurious comfort YET at a fraction of the price. 

The Horathapola Estate, with a price per night over 300€ (on a Half Board basis) was supposed to be ""the cherry on the cake"" on our journey. Unfortunately, and based on our experience across other Sri Lanka luxury properties, we were disappointed to see that whilst good, it was at least 100€ / night overpriced. 

Lastly, their payment policiy: ""cash only"" felt enormously weird and a bit off for a property of this price range. The reasons they gave us for that weren't quite clear either to say the least. It wasn't a problem of cable reception, as they told us that card payment was possible but with an 18% extra charge. Given this outrageous charge, we decided to proceed with cash payment. I mean outrageous such extra carge was never made to us in any of the other luxury accomodations. Where we were always allowed to pay by card, with no extra taxes included / no hidden charges.

We are afraid, based on the above, that we cannot give a 5 star rating to this property.","Amazing food and beautiful property BUT way to overpriced and weirdly ""cash-only""","2019-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d1235422-r664408583-Horathapola_Estate-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for the honest and valuable feedback. 

We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed the food and the activities we offer at the Horathapola Estate.

Horathapola Estate is an ideal place for those who wish to stay away from all the hustle and bustle and to reconnect with nature. You may have felt a lack of human touch as we allow our guests to embrace the calm and quiet ambiance of the estate. 

However, we once again thank you for experiencing Horathapola and appreciate the time taken to share a review.

Many thanks for your review.  On behalf of the Management of Horathapola Estate, firstly I would like to apologize for your experience. 

We understand that it is rather boring to be isolated, staying far from the hustle and bustle. Hence the reason we have organized activities, such as walks around the village, bullock cart rides, walks around the Estate property and many more. I hope that you were able to experience some of these, if not all. 

We began operations 12 years ago, ever since we did not have Wi-Fi/TV facilities as the hotel has always been a great place to relax and unwind, to be away from the big resorts and busy towns. This certainly has  been the need of our clientele throughout the years. However due to many requests, we understand that it is essential to have Wi-Fi, therefore we will have these facilities installed by the end of this month.

We are glad to know you were happy with the rooms, and yet regret that the food was not up to expectations.  We mainly focus on Authentic Sri Lankan food although we do find out our clients preferences before preparing the meals. 

We are also very sorry that you had to go out of the way to approach our staff, which I believe is absolutely unacceptable. We will take this into serious consideration for our future clients will not experience what you had to go through.

Lastly, our swimming pool is made of cement, it’s a naturally filtered salt water pool. Due to excessive rain the pool tends to look rather murky at times although our staff a Horathapola managers to keep it clean right through. 

We truly appreciate you for sharing the negative points, as it gives us an opportunity to work harder for the future. We will look into each issue in detail, and overcome the shortfalls that you have experienced.  I like to thank you for having  chosen to stay with us and would like to apologize once again for any inconvenience caused. 

Many thanks,
The Management Horathapola Estate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 6 Wadumunnegedara, Marawila 60200 Sri Lanka","Marawila","Sri Lanka","60200",,"No. 6 Wadumunnegedara","","1235422","7.397597","Marawila, North Western Province","79.9592","Horathapola Estate","518","4.9","0","1","5","39","472","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612379-d1235422-Reviews-Horathapola_Estate-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html","http://www.horathapola.com","2013-05-09","OTHER","3",,"Value","3","Rooms","4","Location","1","Cleanliness","4","Service","2","Sleep Quality","4","It's too quiet.

Thank you for your good custom and interesting feedback, we’re all very sad you left with mixed feelings and, for where we failed. I promise we do try hard to please all of the people all of the time and so, can only apologize for the fact that we couldn’t please you entirely. Thank you at least for noting ‘positives’ at Buckingham Place, below is my reply with respect to your ‘negatives’.

Given that what constitutes quality, style, individuality and good taste is so incredibly subjective, neither your view nor those of hundreds of former guests can be wrong. I reply in defence of my own view however; since 2010, guests have raved about our garden suites - to the extent that one of many ‘regulars’ books the very suite you stayed in each time he visits and, has even asked to buy it! A week prior to your arrival he departed at the end of his 7th 2 week stay in 7 years, and is already planning his next. Pre-season, as we always do, each bedroom and suite was refurbished. Studiously, each was kept as it was when we opened - timeless, understated and simple I'm told. How foolish would I be to change a thing, having been implored by so many not to? I can only be sorry therefore, that our accommodation doesn’t appeal to your particular taste.

Spa. As you haven’t said what disappointed you I can only say; feedback has been superb throughout the spa’s first season, keeping it busy with resident and non-resident guests alike, many on multiple occasions. Please feel free to write and tell me what you didn’t like as, it might be something I can improve on for others. In keeping with the entire property, our spa is meant to be a simple, understated facility as opposed to, over indulgent and/or generic 5* in style and/or service. I do respect your right not to like how we do things!

Communication; 60 Sri Lankans are learning and working hard at Buckingham Place, all year round. Recuited from remote access locations largely, team members excel mostly, and win awards for so doing, in what is essentially an alien environment whilst, conversing in anything but their mother tongue! If Sri Lankans could travel freely as we do, I ask how many would be served by staff conversant with their language (to any extent) or culture? Personally, I think it fair to cut people a little slack whenever I'm unable to make myself understood in Sri Lanka, even if initially, frustration gets the better of me. Having debriefed my team today, our failure was quite simply a collision of frustrating communication failures but, I was present through your stay so naturally ask, why didn't you bring your concerns to me, specifically your belief that vegetarians aren’t adequately catered for here? Nothing is further from the truth in fact, so many pay tribute to this fact on this forum and in other ways.

The hotel is a lifeline and for many staff, an opportunity unimagined or easy to come by. Most lacked employment, prior experience and/or relevant qualifications, while others lacked learning and fulfillment through work. Therefore, your feedback really is important whether we like or agree with it or not. Thanks to it, we've reintroduced two initiatives; dietry consultations (for those with special needs) and emailing of ‘Being Here’ (our in-house guide) to every guest on arrival. It was already the WIFI log-in page and, free to read pre-arrival on our website. 

Buckingham Place will on my watch, remain a small, independent, imaginative alternative to the 'buffets and buses' of large interantional brands. We’ll continue to appreactive and react to feedback because, it makes us better at times, just as it has done with yours. I wish we’d pleased you but, blame only myself for being unable to. Though unlikely I know, I'd relish the opportunity to show you Buckingham Place in a better light and 'get you on board' with what we do. I assure you of a warm welcome should you ever wish to return, in the meantime I wish you many happy and varied travel experiences!
 
Warm regards,
Nick & the Team

Starting with the positives, staff were extremely friendly, with Nick and his team going out of their way to make us feel welcome.  They provided a honeymoon chocolate cake at the beginning and end of our stay and a lovely card which was signed by the whole team.

The pool is the highlight and is every bit as impressive in real life as in the pictures. It’s a really beautiful space and despite the hotel being fairly busy when we visited, there were always plenty of sunloungers available.  We loved the fact that board games are provided and we also made good use of the Pool/Snooker table.

On the downside, we didn’t think the rooms were brilliant, particularly the bathroom. We struggled a bit with the food and found options for vegetarians rather limited. We mentioned this to Nick and he put it down as a communication issue.

The spa was a disappointment and although the service at the hotel is very friendly and well-intentioned we sometimes struggled to be understood, for example if we asked for something that they don’t have, like brown bread, the waiter would say that he will bring it and then it would never arrive. 

It’s clear from these reviews that people love Buckingham Place but we didn’t quite get it and found it to be extremely expensive given our overall experience.  We left early to return to a 5* place on the other side of Tangalle where for a few more dollars you get a completely different experience.

Finally, Nick was lovely throughout and I feel harsh writing a slightly critical review of something that is obviously so popular, but for the sake of balance I think it’s only fair to share our experience.","Mixed Feelings","2018-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r573046518-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",
,"8","463164834",,"en","1943029",,"Owner","464260357","en","2017-03-03","Buckinghamplace","Firstly, thank you for coming to stay and then, for reviewing the hotel afterwards. Though saddened by it, I view what you say as quite helpful as it might inspire travelers to research more thoroughly before selecting this or any other hotel. These days there are abundant resources to reference – including for Buckingham Place. Our own website for example, includes amongst many useful features, named room photos with good descriptions, location information, even a swimming advisory - most hotels are not so candid! We truthfully describe our property as being at a remote access location, on a wilderness beach, on the edge of a nature sanctuary as well as; Rekawa beach being un-swimmable from, deliberately to avoid guests being surprisingly disappointed. Trip Advisor – not only for traveler reviews is another resource. One can view 900+ photos on this site mostly taken by guests plus, even more can be found on Instagram and Facebook. 

Strangely, you gave us no reason to believe at the time, you were not actually enjoying your stay, so naturally I’m surprised and sad to learn ours was your least favorite hotel. Overwhelmingly, as you may have noted, so many reviewers describe it as their most favorite - often in the entire world! The many accolades on this site not least 9 Travelers Choice Awards this year alone (Sri Lanka/Asia/World) plus, its #1 ranking above all Sri Lankan hotels for more than 5 years (at time of reply) suggests to me at least, that we must be doing something right and the property must suit the overwhelming majority of its patrons. As you rightly suggest, you’re recounting an experience of the hotel not judging me (or other hotels?) which, is wholly fair and sensible. I do believe however, had your research been thorough you might have judged the hotel as ‘not for me’ before choosing it – review scores alone are inadequate I believe, as no two #1’s are the same or even similar in my experience.

Before finishing I will correct you on several points that would mislead others. Having applied for the original planning consent I’m qualified to say the hotel is NOT several hundred metres from the beach. Edge of pool to beach is 60m (with direct access from our own beach land), centre of restaurant to beach is 75m and, whilst the spectacular elevated view is of the sea not beach, that is because beach vegetation is protected by law, especially in a wildlife habitat. From our front gate to the beach is just 75m and from your room to the beach I estimate is 150m max. Sun loungers are not squashed in anywhere and can be found scattered throughout the 5 acre property. Granted, guests may well move them at their will! As for atmosphere? This is where I did wonder at first whether indeed you were reviewing this hotel. This is one of just a handful of southern hotels known to me and friends, renowned for having one and, one reason so many guests return – not for readymade hotel nightlife/entertainment I hasten to add but, for the conviviality of its guests and yes, its owner too. A classic jazz/swing background most evenings adds something too I'm told, but generally its the charming and sociable personalities of our guests that make this place 'tick'.  

When more than 95% of our guests rave in some way or another about the hotel and its team, I would be a fool to change a thing unless of course I could improve it still further. I’m genuinely sorry our hotel wasn’t for you but, seek to reassure all readers of this reply that, I and my team of 55 Sri Lankans try everything possible to make it special for everyone.
. 
Likewise I wish you well and hope you’ll give this hotel another chance to impress you one day.

Best wishes, 
Nick.

The restaurant and pool hold a view of the sea but not of the beach.

We stayed in a standard double (no5) which over looked the room directly in front - the room was uninspiring; very large but lacking any charm or character.

We have stayed in nine hotels in Sri Lanka, some luxury but mainly ""boutique"" but surprisingly (given the reviews) Buckingham Place is our least favourite.
.
Having read the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor I did spend the first few days wondering if we were in the same hotel!

The hotel has had a major change with the opening of the new pool, dining room, bar etc. the pool is very large (looks great) but dominates the area and squashes the sun beds in on either side. The large dining area lacks atmosphere. The old pool (which is now the quiet pool) and garden is a lovely environment and I can imagine how the old restaurant would have been a far more socially interactive, cosy space.

Nick, the owner of the property and the subject of many of the previous reviews, is indeed a pleasant man but my review is based on the property and my experience not on an individual.

Whilst I feel annoyed at this property for disappointing us at the end of what was otherwise a great trip (we had stayed at two other property's prior to Buckingham Place on this holiday) it would be unfair to rate the hotel as less than average; the food is good (but takes forever) and they provided a kind surprise to help celebrate an anniversary. The service is fine but not exceptional (we have never really received bad service in Sri Lanka). 

I wish Nick and the team well but the above is an honest representation of my experience – we never really ‘got’ Buckingham Place.","Surprisingly disappointing!!","2017-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r463164834-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",
,"16","263833758",,"en","1943029",,"Owner","264192888","en","2015-04-07","Buckinghamplace","I’m bewildered as to why some people prefer to complain after the event and give not the slightest hint of dissatisfaction at the time of it..! 

I’m bewildered too as to how in this ‘information age’ travellers in search of swimming beaches could so mistakenly choose an hotel which candidly and caringly volunteers advise that its nearby beach is unsuitable for swimming and, where its owner regularly and heartily thanks his former guests for saying so in their Trip Advisor reviews.
 
So, I must thank you first as I do all others, for your timely reminder not to swim from Rekawa Beach within the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Whilst so doing however, I draw your kind attention and that of all readers, to a sentence in the review immediately preceding yours (I hope they won’t mind), “We particularly enjoyed taking the hotel bikes along the small tracks of Rekawa village and finding hidden coves and beaches for swimming”. These guests, and in fact too many others to mention (several less able and/or elderly guests – myself included) thoroughly enjoy sea bathing within easy reach of the hotel with quite a number being kind about our modest 10 x 4m ‘cooling off’ swimming pool into the bargain! I think you’re the first to complain about the slight effort required to walk up the beach a bit, to enjoy yourselves in the sea, and reply; I’m sorry but you are simply wrong about how difficult it is to get in the sea within a fairly short time and believe, one really must take location and climate into account when researching and planning overseas travel – especially to the tropics. I add to what I say by pasting in this from our website Info Page: ‘Swimming. Rekawa Beach is breathtakingly beautiful and usually deserted. Sea bathing is not advised within the immediate vicinity of the hotel but a nearby rock pool (c15 minute walk) and much safer beaches are easily accessed by Tuk Tuk. For cooling off under the sun our modest hotel pool is adequate for most and, not overly challenging’. A final note on swimming; the hotel is not a ‘water-park’ nor is this Saint Tropez but, a long infinity lapping pool with additional pool bar is quietly nearing completion (opens later this year I hope) on adjoining beach front land. With the sole aim of pleasing everyone, after commissioning the new pool we’ll keep the existing, much loved one full of water and open.
 
Isolation. Isolation, stunning flora and fauna, a peaceful sanctuary to ‘get away from it all’ is the whole point of this hotel – I’m not sure how you missed this simple, widely accessible message? Website information points to it and guests regularly pay tribute to the fact that the hotel and Rekawa are loved overwhelmingly for the reasons above – if you don’t believe me please read the hotels current Trip Advisor page, all previous ones and our website. I’m delighted to add too, higher numbers than imagined or dreamt of are returning to Buckingham Place - for its isolation, ethos and excellent service I’m told. Even I didn’t anticipate how popular this small, isolated, unassuming hotel might become!
  
Don’t choose this hotel if: you like flexibility in your vacation. I consider this view utterly lacking in foundation and credibility! If you had taken time to notice fellow guests, those who chose, kept perfectly busy in and around the hotel and by venturing further afield. As I write, during our long and lazy breakfast session I see happy, contented travellers who have; whale watched, surfed, canoed, cycled and visited, national parks and rock temples, a rain forest, the local markets, swimming beaches and beach-shack restaurants – all from this very isolated access challenged hotel. Thankfully there are no jet-skis, oligarch super-yachts or boom-boom nightclubs in Rekawa… just yet. 

Don’t choose this hotel if: you’re looking for a diverse food experience. 5 x Connoisseur house teas, freshly ground Sri Lankan coffee beans roasted then sent monthly from the highlands by taxi; 12 x unique a la carte Breakfast menu choices (or suggest your own combo), 16 x Snack menu choices (small and light/large and filling), 35 x Main menu items across the board over five, daily changing menus plus, many more ideas ‘up our sleeve’ and available on request (just as we advise clearly on arrival). All the special diets/cuisines and effort to please on offer here tell another and quite unique story to the one you tell – the exact opposite to your unjust criticism in fact. Why didn’t you, as our guests are invited to, simply ask for suggestions if none of our tried, tested and printed repertoire whetted your appetite? I find this incredulous. 

Finally on this subject, a typical menu and comprehensive information on dining can be found at our website and, many constructive reviews have been submitted by diners who would in very large number I’m sure, contradict and perhaps ridicule you most vociferously! Sure we’re not perfect, not by any means, but with a small handful at least of (what some diners tell us are) world class dishes, our all Sri Lankan kitchen crew is much better than you give it credit for being as are our service levels for which we are currently ranked as a Travellers Choice #2 in Sri Lanka in addition to ranking #1 in the Best Small Hotels category.

I take great exception to what I consider an irresponsible comment (one clearly meant to damage a good reputation); ‘armies of mosquitoes’ and fairly ask, why you didn’t you mention them at the time if this was indeed true? Why would anyone not tell us if the 'flying ants' that evening were actually mosquitoes? We could then be expected and rightly so, to take action to eradicate them. FYI; at considerable expense a contractor fogs the entire property every 2 weeks with eco/animal friendly insect repelling/killing products. This precautionary measure is simply the action of a responsible hotelier and hotel resident. I live here year round too, using neither repellents, medicines nor even plug-ins or coils. For hygiene and aesthetic reasons we do not (there’s no need) install nets in accommodation but instead pay exemplary attention to the potential issue. Inevitably a few mosquitoes survive and prosper, we are after all in the tropics. But largely as I suspect was the case, what you really experienced were short-lived flying ants or similar which come and go in a matter of minutes/hours, usually after short cloud bursts (they are generally attracted to light). These flying irritants are regularly the subject of mistaken identity. 

For perspective, on a warm September evening in southern France last year I was bitten more times on the terrace of a friends’ apartment than I might ever expect to be through spending a year in Rekawa! As for no walks without torches and being ushered back to your room? Your comment is frankly insulting. We try to avoid excessive light pollution largely for aesthetics hence the low-level garden lighting and, the Team is trained to exercise thoughtful care of guests along with good manners. I’m sorry to note you misunderstood our good intent, most guests actually appreciate us caring and good manners and compliment us on this initiative. Once again, did you say anything at the time? I think not - we would not have wasted our time if you had. 

Hot bathroom. Since 17th December 2014 until today, for all but 5 nights, your bedroom has been occupied by resident guests I'm happy to say. Not one has mentioned a thing out of the ordinary even during this current hot spell. Nor incidentally, have they complained of so called ‘armies’ of mosquitoes which I believe is a scurrilous accusation. All the same, I don’t dismiss your comment about a hot bathroom and, will look into it later today or tomorrow. Again though, why didn’t you simply mention this at the time? For your comfort we would have happily installed a movable stand fan within minutes if you had only requested us to.

Towel changes. Our policy is to change towels and bed linens every other day or beforehand if necessary and/or requested. I consider it inexcusable therefore, that we didn’t replace your towels after a second night. Please note; we respectfully ask guests to deposit towels in the linen basket for more frequent changes if so desired. I have investigated the matter and the room Team has been re-trained this morning. I apologise unreservedly for our service failure and thank you for bringing it to my attention. However, this or any other matter you’ve raised could have been resolved so easily and painlessly in minutes, had you only thought to mention it at the time.
 
Your statement; ‘we were checking out a day ahead of time, and while the owner wasn’t there at that moment, no one even asked why we decided to leave abruptly’ is according to my information, somewhat economical with the truth. I was actually in contact from Colombo with our GM and restaurant Captain on your early departure while on business. Both informed me independently that when asked, your partner informed them your travel plans had unavoidably changed and also, that you were happy with the Team and your stay at the hotel overall. I of course instructed them to waive any charge for your late cancelled night – our lost business. I’m therefore utterly mystified by your unfair assertion that we didn’t care. Had we not, surely we would have charged you for the night you cancelled at short notice? Unlike normal practise elsewhere and contrary even to our own policy of inadequate notice, we didn’t charge you – instead we felt sorry for you because you misled us to believe you had no choice other than change your planned itinerary!  I and my colleagues feel justifiably aggrieved by this obvious misrepresentation of fact and surprised too that our generosity has been conveniently overlooked. Ironically, guests occupying your room prior to you extended their stay with a late check out, they thoroughly enjoyed the room and their stay in it and didn't want to leave the hotel I recall... 
 
I hope that in a roundabout way your review and my customary reply underline the strengths of this establishment and Team. For example; integrity (candid and caring swimming advice) and willingness to go to any length, to welcome, satisfy and care for all guests like they’re family. I’m deeply saddened all the same, that since showing enthusiasm and appreciation for the hotel on the occasions we met and, considering the overriding ethos of this place (‘we recognise you’re on holiday, therefore everything must be perfect - just tell us if it’s not’ – my words upon introducing myself) you have judged the hotel with so little consideration for a Teams morale or its good reputation. It seems unfair that simply because you failed to research and choose accommodation more suited to your swimming needs, we’re left wondering how we can please everybody all of the time - other than try to of course. We also ponder a small mystery, what makes people resolve to say nothing of their dissatisfaction at the actual time they’re given every opportunity and are actually invited to do so?

I respectfully suggest that hotels like ours may well not ‘click’ for you in anything like the way this one does for the vast, overwhelming majority of its guests or in the way you seem to think they should.

Please do not return. 

Yours sincerely,
Nick & the Team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rekawa Beach Road Rekawa Village, Rekawa, Tangalle 82200 Sri Lanka","Rekawa","Sri Lanka","82200",,"Rekawa Beach Road","Rekawa Village","1943029","6.047304","Rekawa, Netolpitiya, Tangalle, Southern Province","80.855316","Buckingham Place","1232","5","1","2","9","31","1189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2260795-d1943029-Reviews-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html","http://buckinghamplace.lk/","2015-04-05","OTHER","3",,"Cleanliness","4","Service","3","Sleep Quality","4",,,,,,,"Choose this hotel if:
- you want to spend a few days away from civilisation
- you’re interested in wildlife

Don’t choose this hotel if:
- you like swimming
- you like flexibility in your vacation
- you’re looking for a diverse food experience

A bit more in detail: isolated location

The hotel is located in a wild place 12 km away from the nearest town. Part of this way is a narrow, bumpy forest road. If you’re interested in local restaurants, markets, etc - you’re not getting them here. If you want to run away from civilisation - then it’s a different story.

Close to wildlife

It’s close to the jungle, which means you can share breakfast with a peacock or see monkeys drinking water from the pool. But be aware that this also includes armies of mosquitoes and no evening walks without a light torch. Actually, they’ll usher you straight to the room from the restaurant.

Deal breaker for us: no swimming

And here comes the part which became the deal breaker for us, who love water. There is no swimming experience here. The beach is just 50 m away, but you can only admire the ocean there without entering it - blame the big waves. 

The nearest ‘rock pool’ where the waves aren’t dangerous is in a 25-min walk - not so easy to cover that distance in tropical heat. The nearest safe beach is a 30 min ride by tuk-tuk. And the small hotel pool will only work for a quick dip. 

Room

Every room is located in a separate building with lake view. It’s quite spacious and comfortable, but the bathroom is way too warm though - it has a glass roof which turns it into a greenhouse. Definitely motivates for a very quick shower. 

Also, the room service was a bit strange - the towels weren’t changed in 3 days. I guess you need to specifically request that.

Restaurant: limited choices

The food was good, but a choice from 3 options for dinner seemed a bit limited. I think it could be an issue if we stayed longer - as I mentioned, the town is 12 km away, so going to a different restaurant is a difficult quest.

One more thing I would mention is that there’s room for improvement in service. We were checking out a day ahead of time, and while the owner wasn’t there at that moment, no one even asked why we decided to leave abruptly.

I wouldn’t say that Buckingham place is a bad hotel. Seeing the wild nature was an interesting experience, but other than that it didn’t click with us.

We would not come back to this hotel.","Not a place for those who like swimming","2015-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r263833758-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",
,"10","250163722",,"en","1943029",,"Owner","250308558","en","2015-01-21","Buckinghamplace","Thank you for coming to stay and for following up with helpful feedback. Naturally I prefer to read only glowing testimonials and therefore I’m sad upon reading yours. I do respect your overall view and right to express it of course, regardless of how out of step it seems when compared to so many others. 

Firstly, Buckingham Place tries hard to and generally does exceed the expectations of its guests, while providing a unique alternative to the typically soulless, generic opulence and in my view, irritating pampering of so-called designer (chic?) hotels. However, regardless of what we try to do, we can be human and fail sometimes. From what you say it appears we might have failed in certain instances so I apologize unreservedly for the sense of disappointment you feel. 

Marketing; the hotels website images (including interiors) are deliberately ones taken by amateurs – former guests mainly. I write/update all website copy to avoid ‘advertising gloss’ and our guests frequently remark that it’s down to earth honesty and images don’t actually do justice to the hotel at all and, certainly don’t oversell it. I therefore fail to understand what more I can do to ensure every guest knows exactly what to expect when they arrive, other than advice as I do, to start their research by acquainting themselves with the hotels website and, to view some of the 1000’s of unsolicited images and videos posted online by former guests. Whilst recognizing not every traveler has the time or inclination to look at a hotels website and research it thoroughly, I do advise everyone to make sure prior to booking that the hotel and its culture are of the style and kind normally desired and above all, that the hotel charge rates fall within their budget range - so they have no need to worry what they are spending or go without. Though very helpful, Trip Advisor rankings are by no means a substitute for proper research.

Service; Team training has remained a constant since 2 years prior to opening the hotel. In this and all areas of the business investment is heavy, sustained and regularly produces minor miracles. The food you enjoyed was cooked and served by former (under-employed/unemployed) fishers and farmers largely, none of whom had experience prior to joining us. In fact the current team (numbering some 42) benefits year round from well remunerated employment (not seasonal), 3 meals a day, accommodation assistance, continuous development opportunity, pensions, medical and other welfare support. Also, in spite of our advice “only tip if we exceed expectations and then please do so at the end if you wish” – guest gratuities are significantly higher than many hotels. Buckingham Place service is meant first and foremost to be genuine. The Team is taught the importance of anticipation, genuine warmth, friendliness and professionalism. Sincerity is what guests repeatedly tell us they find here, not slick silver-service or overly servile robots. Front of house staff are much more likely to be sincere than ‘in ones face’ or forever pestering or ‘selling up’. Our Team is not meant to be a throwback to long gone colonial days nor are its members chosen for their looks, age, gender or past experience – they are chosen first as people, who like all of us are fallible at times. 

Other issues; our entire bed sheet stock was replaced this season with 100% Indian cotton/high thread count items. It is policy that where possible and certainly where necessary or requested, bed linen is changed daily or every other day and, we do so with rare exception. However, earlier high rainfall throughout Sri Lanka, the worst in 57 years, caused long turnaround delays at the (outsourced) laundry. Regrettably, while the laundry caught up with its massive backlog every hotel in the area suffered operational headaches. I’m very sorry we inconvenienced you, didn’t inform you, and didn’t do better in this regard. Please also note; housekeeping staff are trained to avoid disturbing guest’s sanctuary to clean rooms. I’m informed of instances when they were unable to access your suite. Bathroom products; coincidently, while at this point in my reply, I have just asked house-keeping staff to make up a package for a departing guest, to include all of the complimentary items you complain about. Hardly a day goes by without a guest requesting we do this. I have answered this criticism before and since added additional high quality foam bath, body wash and an alternative shampoo, strangely though, it’s the excellent (but cheap) ayurvedic products people ask for most to take home and therefore, we would be foolish to dispense with them. I can only say sorry you didn’t like them! Quality of service/attentiveness of staff; I was at the hotel during your 4 night stay and can honestly say that I did not witness a shortfall in service but then I rarely saw you at the restaurant. Neither did you bring to my attention (or that of my General Manager) even a hint of dissatisfaction or disappointment which, we invite all guests to do the very moment they arrive at the hotel and then again in our in room guide ‘It’s Only Common Sense’ – so we are all surprised to read this now. 

Design of interiors; please see my earlier reference to the hotel website and the 1000’s of images online. Minibar we don’t install them – we prefer instead to provide room service and fairly priced beverages. We do provide a small refrigerator in each bedroom/suite, sometimes guests purchase exotic fruits when out for example, so we provide the means to keep them cool along perhaps, with a half full bottle of wine purchased at the restaurant which, they did not consume immediately. We also stock the refrigerator with some fairly unusual complimentary snack items - you may have noticed them. Rooms; Chic modernist? I neither aspire nor pretend to align the hotel with a specific style genre as I have no wish to alienate guests (the overwhelming majority) who choose the hotel for its unique personality and values not its fashion statement.

Location; I chose the location of the hotel for its remote natural setting not its close proximity to nightlife and beach restaurant life. This point we make clear on our website and elsewhere and, it was made very clear throughout my colleagues correspondence with you “We can suggest alternatives to our restaurant and do so based on positive feedback from guests. There are a couple of restaurants I will be happy to guide you to at the time. Generally speaking there are alternatives at various levels within a c25-30 minute tuk-tuk ride”.
Your observation; not once were we offered a glass of water. Every single sunny day the Team deliver complimentary water or various types of cool drink to guests relaxing in the main garden. It’s just possible you weren’t around when we did but if you were then I apologize for our oversight and, promise to monitor this in future.   

Throughout your stay, whenever we conversed, I felt I was being questioned continually. You appeared preoccupied with an earlier booking/rates issue and how much everything was costing but curious too, to know how easy it was to buy land in Sri Lanka and so on. So much so it occurred to me briefly, you might be contemplating building your own hotel in Sri Lanka or already own one – I am often asked such things. I am sorry as I said before, that when reserving via a third party partner you were confused by what appeared to be a much lower rate. As my colleague explained in his correspondence and, when I discussed the issue with you, rates are exactly the same whether one books through our website or that of a third party and, the third parties do make clear that local taxes etc will be charged at the hotel.

My conclusion; I reply as robustly as you review but truly believe there must be merit in some of your service shortfall issues. For these I can only apologize for again and look out for in future. Overall however, I think the rates we charge may well have clouded your view, especially noticing how much happier you were at a guest house (also reviewed) in the Rs.2500 price band. To build, equip staff, operate and to maintain a hotel and deliver international standards, by the sea, in the tropics, in a developing country, is a costly business indeed – after 12 years I await return on substantial investment. For a Team to fully anticipate every conceivable need of foreign speaking tourists arriving from entirely different cultures means, challenges will inevitably arise. How we recognize and overcome those challenges will inevitably lead to how we as guests in another country are judged.

Thank you again for coming to stay, I’m sorry we disappointed you and that you missed the very essence of Buckingham Place. Please feel free to return, I would welcome the opportunity to host you again and hopefully, change your perception of what this hotel is all about.

Yours sincerely and on behalf of the Team,

Naturally, that set the expectations very high. 
I am comparing this hotel to a number of similarly priced (say $200-400 range) hotels, mostly of similar style (detached huts/houses, beach-side), and in somehow similar destinations (tropical developing countries, e.g. India, Thailand, Burma, Mexico, Vietnam, Seychelles, etc). 

I believe this is a nice hotel, with a few features which are certainly above average (food; beautiful deserted beach; size of rooms) and a few which are below average (quality of service/attentiveness of staff; design of interiors; quality of products used in bathrooms, bed linens, minibar, etc; little touches, or rather lack of those, which distinguish outstanding hotels). Please don’t get me wrong, it was a nice enough place, but for those 5 star ratings to have any meaning, I believe they should be reserved for the truly outstanding, breath-taking properties which are a class apart in their respective price ranges. 

My rationale when choosing this hotel was: the location is somehow remote, the beach (per owner’s own admission) un-swimmable, the property facing away from the beach. It’s in those slightly less-than-perfect locations that outstanding value-for-money hotels are often found: what costs have been saved on rent/purchase of land, can be ploughed back into providing exceptional service. I thought the quality of service and accommodation was fair, but far from exceptional. 

Rather than repeat what’s already been said in other 3-star reviews, just a few points. Rooms are admittedly of very large size, yes, but rather than chic modernist, a bit bland and empty in my view. Toiletries are of the cheap, local sort, with prices of $0.50-$1 clearly showing on the boxes. I understand that the intention was to provide ayurvedic, local toiletries but in a 5-star hotel it should be expected that top-quality local stuff is sourced. 

And then the service.. Bed linens were not changed daily, in fact we had to ask after third night to have them changed. When we were spending a full day by the pool, not once were we offered a glass of water – it’s not that difficult to figure out that when a hotel is completely removed from local shops where water bottles could be bought, people will want to have something to drink when spending several hours in the sun. It’s this anticipation of guests’ needs, or rather complete lack of it, that I thought was rather disappointing. “We felt like we had to ask for everything” is a quote from another review, so clearly I’m not the only one here. It’s possible to feel absolutely pampered in some other hotels in Asia costing ½ the price. $150/night used to buy me things such as: several times a day room service, done seamlessly whenever we left the room, making sure that we never returned to empty water bottles, unmade bed, etc; refreshments (just a glass of icy water would do!) brought to us by the pool, or fresh pool towels; returning to our room in the evening to find candles lit, or fresh flowers arranged on return from breakfast; even more ridiculous things e.g. personalised news digest delivered daily in the morning.  I’m not saying I expect all of the above, but if nothing apart from the most basic, once a day room service is offered, I can’t really understand why Buckingham Place is listed as top #1 hotel for service in the country. To be fair, when we did ask for things, we got them – e.g. a local newspaper or change of bed sheets. But that’s completely expected in a  $300/night property. 

Finally, the location – beach is stunning, yes, but the hotel is really far from any other restaurants, shops, etc. I had been assured the nearest beach-side restaurant was 2km away – it’s more like 4km, which Google Maps confirms. We braved the walk on 2 occasions, but I doubt many other guests will want to. Meaning that all meals will have to be taken in the hotel’s own restaurant – very nice food, but the total bill for 2 will then easily exceed $150/day for food and modest amounts of drinks alone.

Firstly, thank you for choosing Buckingham Place and following up your stay with this helpful feedback. Whilst much happier to read ‘rave reviews’ I must take it on the chin if we get it wrong. To my knowledge, not since 2012 has a guest expressed such disappointment on Trip Advisor and I thank you for at least highlighting the ‘positives’ of your short stay and for ticking average as your overall ‘score’. 

Measuring up to expectations generated by so many incredible reviews and our position in the marketplace is obviously challenging, perhaps even impossible? Constantly we strive to bring happiness to our guests but sadly, on this occasion, we owe an apology. Attentive service, a more imaginative packed breakfast and good towels are of course, wholly reasonable expectations. With regards several issues I’m afraid we failed to communicate effectively. For example; our restaurant serves diners whenever they choose to eat - as policy. Meal times and indeed menu choices are frequently tailored to suit individuals - we often find ourselves serving breakfast and a bespoke lunch simultaneously, late into the afternoon at that! Normally too, we happily cater for early risers, vegetarians or guests with special dietary requirements by consultation, and rarely do we disappoint. As for concrete floors and blankets in rooms? At the helpful suggestion of former guests we offer ‘take home’ flip-flops to any guest not familiar or comfortable with these typically tropical floors and blankets to those who like to switch off the air-conditioning at night. Please don’t misunderstand, I don't refute anything you say nor, offer feeble excuses, to the contrary. I apologise for not clearly highlighting the above messages.

I would like to explain my thinking on a couple of points. Bathroom products; these local ayurvedic products were chosen to be in keeping with the simplicity or ‘opulence free’ Sri Lankan personality of the hotel. In defence of quality, when using the shampoo personally, my hair stops falling out and hardly a week passes by without guests complimenting the products or requesting samples to take home – they are incredibly popular notwithstanding the awful cardboard box packaging! As a traveller, too many times I find a multitude of bland, ineffective products in my bathroom, most of which irritate me as they are merely a branding exercise for the hotel. Marshmallows; a small selection of Sri Lankan sweets, freshly pan roasted peanuts plus, a couple of apples and juice cartons are stocked in the mini-fridge, just in case a ravenous guest should arrive. All are provided fresh and with our compliments. Admittedly unusual, this alternative to generic tins of stale crisps and other ludicrously priced mini-bar items we are told is fun and a refreshing change.

Much of what we do at Buckingham Place is based on my own observations, preferences and gripes as a traveller or the suggestions of former guests. The hotels architecture, interiors and overall culture is a deliberate breakaway from the more commonly found colonial pastiche, and as this isn’t everybody’s cup of tea, clear descriptions and images can be viewed on our website plus, additional candid images and descriptions of the hotel can be found on Trip Advisor. To apologise for my own tastes and for what to date has brought much joy to so many would be insincere, I hope you can appreciate that, I’m just very sorry and sad that it didn’t please you.
 
Since reading your review I’ve contacted the Team to discuss your comments in more detail - specifically to find remedies for our failings. You have focused me on our weaknesses for which I thank you, I can only apologise for getting it wrong. I would naturally welcome an opportunity to host you once again so that we might get it right and, hope that our shortcoming didn't detract from your holiday in Sri Lanka overall.

We chose Buckingham Place as one of these hotels as we had read such incredible reviews on TripAdvisor. I guess as a result we had high expectations!

The positives: 
1) The hotel is located near a beautiful, litter free beach which was a delight for morning/afternoon walks. It is just a couple of mins walk from the hotel. 
2) Ginger and the wildlife - we love animals so it was a pleasure to get to know Ginger the horse and the other animals that live at Buckingham Place including a couple of dogs, peacocks and various other birds. This was our highlight of the stay.
3) The restaurant/bar area is pleasant and the grounds are well looked after.

What didn't work for us:
1)	Service - we felt like we had to ask for EVERYTHING - I have to be honest but the service was really quite bad. Everyone was pleasant and smiled but nobody seemed particularly on the ball with anything. One time (when we were at the pool) I had to go to the restaurant three times just to ask for a glass of water. Generally I just felt that staff weren't very proactive.They were nice and polite but they need training.

2)	Food – Don't get me wrong, the food was actually good when it came, but the staff weren't very helpful dealing with dietary requirements. I am a vegetarian and the menus didn't really cater to me - 3 nights in a row the vegetarian option for dinner was curry. This is not a problem in itself but in this case it would have been helpful if the staff were a bit more forthcoming with offering alternatives and suggestions on what they could provide. Instead it was more of a case of us going to them and asking / suggesting what they could cook. At most other hotels the staff were really good at handling this and would come up to us each day to discuss meals and what they could offer.

We went on an early day trip one morning and had to leave at 6am. We asked if the hotel could provide us a packed breakfast for us as we had a long journey. We were quite disappointed to find that the breakfast was a packet of lemon cream biscuits and a couple of pieces of fruit. While the kitchen may not have been open, I have stayed at a lot of hotels and had a lot of packed breakfasts in my time and this was by far the worst! We could have stopped on a road side and picked this up. Even a couple of pieces of bread would have been better. Again, it’s not a problem really, but when you are paying USD 300 a night you just expect a bit more. 

Breakfast started at 8.30am as they do a 'lazy breakfast'. We felt this was too late. Similarly, lunch started at 1pm. I think they need to revise the timings slightly to allow people to eat earlier (e.g. 730am and 12.30pm)

4) The rooms - we were disappointed with the rooms, various comments as follows:
- Rooms are really big and very clean but our room (Presidential Suite I believe) was a bit soulless. The rooms are just concrete blocks.
 - No mini bar in rooms (there was a fridge with some old looking marshmallows and two cartons of fruit juice drink - bit strange) 
- No extra blanket/duvet in the room - the air con in the room was fierce and it would have been nice to have an extra blanket in the room available to use. Again we had to ask for this and were given two extra bed sheets (I guess they don't have blankets)
- No robes and rubbish towels / not enough towels
- The toiletries they offered (soap etc) were basically cheap local products in old dirty cardboard boxes. A bar of soap for the shower and no conditioner, shower gel etc (would definitely recommend bringing your own)
-Concrete floors were slippery - my partner nearly fell over twice

Our overall feeling was one of disappointment. Of all the hotels we stayed in during our two weeks it was our least favourite. We left just feeling a bit uncertain about our overall experience. Some of these points are a bit pernickety and we're not really like that as travellers but I think the point is that for USD 300 a night we expected more. While many of these points are small and individually overlooked, there were just too many small things which added up and left us feeling a bit underwhelmed (and at some points irritated).","We didn't really get this place...","2014-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r199230907-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Thankfully overall, you experienced a pleasant stay, although you have raised several points of dissatisfaction which I respond to in order and in full.

Firstly, I’m sorry that you nearly slipped on a cement floor; it would certainly sadden us were a guest to fall or hurt themselves or, if they were even anxious about doing so. Cement floors are for many including me, an attractive architectural feature. They are used almost as widely as ceramic tiles throughout Sri Lanka, largely for practicality, organic appearance and because hard wood forests are have been depleted and carpeting is impractical in the tropics. Deliberately, we use rough-cut granite in (wet) bathrooms and have not polished a single cement floor for over 2 years now. Responsibly, we offer cautionary advice about wet feet and/or floors both verbally on arrival and in our in-room pamphlet entitled “It’s Only Common Sense’.

We choose not to provide ‘brew facilities’ in bedrooms or suites unless asked to. Instead we serve freshly ground coffee and high-grown teas from Sri Lanka’s top estates. This is in preference to typical sachets of processed and generally tasteless generic refreshment given free in city hotel rooms and elsewhere. This quality first policy helps maintain standards in terms of hygiene, cleanliness and guest satisfaction. Pots of connoisseur tea and large French presses of coffee can be served to guest accommodation before breakfast and are included as part of breakfast. Guests can also ask for ‘refills’ - these too are included in our overnight rates. That you were mistakenly charged is a training issue - now in hand. I sincerely apologise for this and ask that you please email us requesting a full refund of this charge. If you had brought this mistake to our attention after checking your final bill the amount would have been deducted without question. Unfortunately, your review is anonymous and therefore I can do nothing further until I hear from you personally I’m afraid. I naturally apologise for our error and for any inconvenience caused.

As we highlight on guest arrival and/or in information provided prior to it; “meal orders can take slightly longer than elsewhere in the world and so we respectfully request the kind patience of all diners. We do not use microwave ovens or pre-prepared ingredients due to our desire to provide tasty fresh food”. There are several menu items that indeed require extra time to create such as the ever popular ‘Rice and Six Curries’ the ‘Pescetarian Lamprais’ and the Sri Lankan ‘Big Village Breakfast’ for two. We sometimes ask late afternoon whether guests would like Chef to reserve a freshly caught fish or order one of the above items. At least 85% of our menu items however, can arrive at a table taking little or no more time than at any decent quality restaurant serving freshly made food. Sadly, in this world where processed, pre-packed fast-food has become the norm, even I forget sometimes just how long it can take to cook up a proper meal!   

Wine and in fact all foreign liquor attracts high import costs/duties/taxes and we are obliged to add government levies/taxes/VAT and service when selling it. Our policy is to avoid ‘marking up’ wine to a prohibitive level and experience thus far tells us that the majority of diners - even our long stay guests, happily order a bottle with their evening meal and, that its quality and cost can be viewed as equivelent to wine sold at a typical UK bistro. Quality of a product and its value to us is subjective. A view of value for money can be clouded by our own budget, exchange rates, cost to buy in our own country plus, a host of other factors. My own experience added to the large volume of guest feedback to date reassures me that our restaurant prices and moreover our value for money is comparative, just and fair. Finally on this, when I order wine at a restaurant myself, I always expect its cost to at least partially reflect the ambience, hospitality and exclusiveness of the estblishment at which I consume it. 

Music played at our restaurant. Generally, the jazz/swing, Latin with a sprinkling of classical/opera has proven very popular with guests so far and is now for some, part of the 'experience’ of being with us I’m told. I am frequently asked what music/artist is playing and for guests to share their own genre choices with us. Simply, a song to make absolutely everybody happy is yet to be written - until it is we’ll continue with our policy of playing fantastic music (my view!).  

Free bicycles. Many thanks for this feedback. I have just inspected them and several are now on their way to the repair shop! 

As for profit? Any made since this project opened 2 years ago has been reinvested. Investment goes directly to Team development, property upgrades/new facilities and guest services. 35 Sri Lankans (and their families comprising more than 100 individuals) currently benefit through; security of permanent, year round positions, training and development, fair wages and pensions etc. Many lives have been uplifted through past and current community initiatives including a voluntary 2 year, $1.2m donor funded/post tsunami project – still saving and improving lives today. Ongoing micro-sponsorship of a community pre-school and its teacher salaries is another example. You say “Not all what it seems!” – clearly another point on which we agree! 

My personal profit? A terrific team supporting me and caring for guests with utmost pride, my life in this paradise and most importantly - the diverse, interesting and appreciative clientele who come to stay with us. Perhaps if the hotel is successful and makes a good profit one day, nobody will begrudge me?

Again, thank you for coming to stay and sorry if we didn’t quite measure up. Please contact us with regards refunding your overpayment and please forgive the error – I assure you it was unintentional. Thank you.

I send Seasons Greeting and Best Wishes from Paradise.

,"4","121849809",,"en","1943029",,"Owner","122455179","en","2012-01-03","Buckinghamplace","Firstly, thank you for your positive comment “we really like the place” and for giving me an opportunity to highlight issues for others to consider prior to travelling to the tropics, namely; weather, insects, expectations and communication.

Your stay in Sri Lanka coincided with unusual weather as you may recall. Prolonged heavy rain and a destructive cyclone may have caused a slight temporary increase in mosquitoes but with certainty the weather caused interruption to the growth and harvest patterns of all local produce along with all types of fishing. 

With regards mosquitoes in your suite; I respectfully remind you that within 20 minutes of us being aware of your concern, our housekeeping team issued new (and extra) plug-in repellents, sprayed the suite throughout with insect repellent, installed mosquito coils for the open air bathroom and checked for signs of infestation of which there were none – after this I inspected your suite personally. We do not provide mosquito nets as they have proven unnecessary thus far and quite simply, until your experience, this issue had not arisen, not even during your previous stay in the same suite. To offer a final perspective on this, after we had eradicated the (one night) problem you confirmed satisfaction with our action.

Room servicing; as you know we offer to service and re-service guest suites and supply new towels and/or bed linen every day if required. Further, I understand you had one complete change of linens during your 3 night stay – two sets for 3 nights. As a matter of course we do not provide a night turn-down service without request as many guests tell us how irritating this is elsewhere. This may explain why you found towels used after your morning room service exactly where you dropped them when returning to your suite later in the day.
 
Air conditioning; I remember saying “when air conditioning is used it’s rare to encounter mosquitoes” and with my apology offered an additional stand-fan for your comfort. You may not have understood me fully and therefore I apologise unreservedly for any miscommunication on my part. Virtually all guests use this everyday convenience, in fact the overwhelming majority would not even consider staying with us if it were not provided! Our classification as a boutique hotel and the demand for it requires that air-conditioning is installed throughout.
  
Mangoes; at your request we endeavoured to source ripe mangoes (two days running). I dispatched kitchen staff to the nearest town and village and personally asked our regular supplier to source them wherever he could and at whatever price – providing they were of suitable ripeness and quality. Due to the reason mentioned above (weather) and the fact that Sri Lanka does not import this fruit item, we were regrettably unable to add them to the abundance of fresh fruit and the exceptionally generous breakfasts the hotel offers. Chef will not prepare un-ripened or low quality fruit or other items to guests – regardless of pressure exerted by a guest and I must say, I believe quite rightly so.

Expectations and communication; when one travels overseas, particularly to developing countries in the tropics it is reasonable to anticipate that not everything we wish for or demand is necessarily available or easily managed. At times, insects or non-availability of certain items and the occasional inconvenience are only to be expected. Also, that as guests in another country perhaps we should accept that it's our own inability to communicate in that country’s 'mother tongue' that is the real barrier to good communication and, not necessarily the fault of innocent local staff. We can try to understand that; intimidating staff who are making genuine effort to please as I an others witnessed is not a solution. 

Sadly I must comment that (during and after your stay) I found it necessary to counsel members of my team whom felt insecure and immensely saddened by behaviour contrary to this perfectly acceptable view. Additionally, several guests were shocked by what they saw as a disproportionate and unnecessary reaction to a matter of relatively low importance. For these reasons I can no longer invite you to this hotel and can only add to your concluding statement of nothing is perfect, the the words; including ourselves at times.

do not like air-conditioning, we told this to the owner (Nick), but got the asnwer, there is no
need for Moskito-Nets and everybody uses air-conditioning, so we should use it as well! 

Also, we had small Ants in our beds and to be true, we never had so many bites and stiches
in our whole holidays in Sri Lanka! (5 weeks!) We left the place after 3 days, instead after 
5 days as planned. 
Breakfast is great, if you do not want to have f.e. Mangoes. We asked 3 days for Mangoes, but were told, Mangoes are not availlable. (You see Mangoes everywhere, in all places, in

Pros:
The room was very large and spacious, and the staff did a great job keeping it clean, and adding little touches like laying candles and roses all of the floor! 

Friendly staff 

Cons:
The food at the restaurant was really not great, it is very average.

The pool seemed dirty. It didn't look like it had any cleaning system in it or if it did not a very good one.

The beach at the front was also quite dirty, with rubbish lying around everywhere. The staff could do a better job to keep the beach in front of the hotel clean. You also can not swim in the ocean as it's very aggressive.

The bathroom in the bedroom is sort of outside and gets very warm! The hot tub is huge but looked grimy and I really did not want to even sit in it, so gave it a miss!

We regret that our restaurant staff did not now the exact supplier from we have received the meet item that you ordered that week, However you may rest assured that all meet that we serve are HALAL certified.

Ayubowan!
 
Thank you for your comment. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our food & spread during your stay at Aditya. However we are sorry that our food portions were not upto your expectations.
 
Furthermore with regards to your comment about the beach being unclean, I’m sure you are aware that as the sea is rough during this period it collects a lot of waste on the shores. This however is being cleaned by the municipal council and not the hotel.
 
More over to comment on our house keeping service it was bought to my attention that our house keeping staff assistance was refused in the morning hour and when they returned later that day the
 “do not disturbed” sign was tagged on.
 
Also we do apologize for the bread being late and we have taken measures to ensure that this does not happen again.
 
We do hope u will visit us once again.
We would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention. It will help us improve our operations and services.

Ayubowan!

Thank you for your review of Aditya and your feedback. 

Please allow us to apologize for the short comings that you have experienced. At Aditya meals are custom prepared to each guest’s requirement off our ala carte menu and is freshly prepared at the time of order which takes least 25 to 30 minutes depending on what our guest choose. 

Further as there were eight guests in your group who had requested for a variety of dishes it had taken slightly longer than our standard serving time as all the dishes are served together. 

We will make note of your comments regarding the food preparation time and take measures to rectify this. 

With regards to your valuables we have conducted and inquiry into this matter and it was brought to our attention that you had informed our front office staff of the loss, who thereafter made all efforts to find the missing item including asking our housekeeping staff to make a thorough search of your room.

We are sorry that you got the impression that we were not interested. This we assure you was certainly not the case and perhaps our front office staff had not adequately communicated this to you.

With regards to your comment of Aditya not being an adults resort we would please like to say that we have never positioned our self as an adult resort. We are an exclusive private luxurious boutique property that welcomes everybody.

Unfortunately, there is not much that we can do about the tides which make the sea dangerous to swim in at certain times of the year. In fact almost the entire western cost is not swimmable at this time of year.

Once again we apologize for any inconvenience that we have caused you and we hope that you will return and give us another opportunity to treat you to the perfect holiday.

Warm Regards,
Shami & the Aditya Team

Whilst the rooms are spacious, I'm not a big fan of the bathrooms which are partially open to elements and meant a constant battle with mosquitoes (unfortunately they make a bee line for me no matter how much repellent I have on) and also means the room is a sweat box after the cool of the bedroom (especially not great when you are trying to dry your hair with the hairdryer). It would be so easy to have the room fully enclosed so I'm not sure what the design theory was around leaving them exposed. 
The bedroom and living area smelt a bit damp and the lighting is dreadful so as soon as the sun sets the room is dim at best. We also found the food average with no Sri Lankan dishes other than breakfast on the menu.
On the positive side, the beach side location is stunning and I think it’s a great idea to be able to order breakfast any time of the day – it’s nice to work to your own holiday lie in schedule! Also the general staff (housekeeping and room service) are excellent.
One small tip, don’t ask reception to book your tuk tuk transport – its double the price.

Thank you for your review of Aditya! We’re happy that you liked the ambiance and all the comforts of Aditya. 

We apologise that your breakfast at Aditya did not meet expectations. At Aditya, we try to offer the utmost flexibility in your holiday, and this includes mealtimes, which is why, instead of buffets, meals are custom prepared to each guest’s requirement. We will make note of your comments regarding the food and take measures to rectify this.

Thank you for your review on Tripadvisor. We value any feedback that we get and hope to work on this to improve Aditya, which mainly targets guests who would like a relaxing and quiet holiday. 

We regret that you didn’t enjoy the food as most of our guests do and will definitely work on improving this.

The plunge pools are usually a welcome break in the balmy southern climate, and we are sorry that you found it too cold for your liking. 

Unfortunately, there is not much that we can do about the weather and the tides which make the sea dangerous to swim in at certain times of the year. 

We are glad that you enjoyed the service however and it was a pleasure to have had you with us.

Thank you for your review of Aditya. We value your praise and criticism of the hotel as we constantly attempt to improve ourselves.

We are glad that you enjoyed the food and service as well as the rooms and the facilities.

We regret that you did not have a good night’s rest because of the stray dogs. This is a recent issue and we are working with the authorities in order to remove them without causing any harm. With regard to the pillows however, we understand that our guests have different preferences and, with this in mind, we have available a pillow menu in each suite, so you can choose a pillow of your liking. The menu includes down pillows as well.

The Shanthi suites offer a view of a courtyard and we will change our literature in order to give our guests a clearer idea of what to expect and thank you and other guests for bringing this to our notice.

The red flag has been put up as the sea has recently been too rough to swim in and we would like to ensure our guest’s safety. We also follow Health and Safety standards that are set out by our travels partners to ensure that guests are safe.

We apologise for the issues that we had with the wifi signals when you stayed with us. We made all attempts to rectify this as soon as possible.

We hope that you will return to Aditya and that you will be able to enjoy a more relaxing holiday with us.

Thank you for taking the time to review Aditya!

We are glad that you enjoyed the ambiance and the food. However, we regret that we could not make your stay more special. 

To address the issues that you have mentioned in your review:

A flat rate for all rooms were based on a request from your host in order to make the reservation and payment process easier for her guests. Sea view rooms are sold at a premium when compared to the garden view rooms since the former have a better view. We had also, at that point, advised that the guests be informed that the different suite categories were available. The rates were also discounted since 10 suites were to be booked and then a per night rate calculated based on the special offer of stay for 4 nights and pay for 3. Your stay was subsequently shortened to 3 nights, but we still upheld the same rate as a measure of goodwill. We regret that this miscommunication has taken place between you and your host. 

Perhaps the drive from the airport would have been faster if the driver had been advised to take the expressway in order to get to Aditya. The drive from the airport to Aditya via expressway takes a maximum of 2.5hours. In the near future, the airport expressway will be connected to the Southern expressway and travel time from the Airport to Aditya reduced to 1.5 hours.  

While we regret to know that your stay in your suite was not comfortable, you were allocated one of the more requested Shanthi suites, which has the galaxy lights on the ceiling and is enjoyed by a majority of guests. The bathrooms are open air and have fans fitted in them in order to avoid them getting too warm. 

We are extremely apologetic about the flooding of the toilets and the inconvenience it caused. The situation occurred due to a rather unusual problem of a pen being stuck in the drain. Back to back bookings of the room did not allow us to delve deeper into the problem, but it was fixed as soon as possible and we apologize wholeheartedly for the inconvenience.

As you have mentioned, our staff is very obliging and our housekeeping team is highly trained. All the bathroom linen is in white and therefore you may have been misled between the bath mats and the towels. 

A remote control is provided in the room and guests usually set the temperature according to their preference. We noticed that the only issue with the air conditioner was that the temperature of the room was higher than our usual setting.

Pest control for mosquitoes is carried out on a regular basis and mosquito repellents are provided in all rooms and plugged in during turn down service every evening. Mosquito nets are also available on request.  

Once again, we are extremely sorry that you did not find perfect respite at Aditya, which is what we strive to provide for any guest. We hope that you will visit us again.

We were there in a large group and paid US$275 per night for our room - we stayed for 3 nights.

The Highs:

- Once through the gate the setting is great and pool very nice
- Food very good and reaonably priced
- Staff very obliging

The Lows:

- It takes 3 hours to get there from Columbo airport
- The sea view rooms are bright and airy, the garden rooms are not. We were allocated a garden room which was gloomy and a bit foisty with a large mosquito population. The toilet flooded our bathroom a few times before we were moved to another gloomy garden room.
- Maintenance and housekeeping could be better. They used the bath towels to mop up the toilet flood, our air con failed and a few guests had to get the room safe fixed.
- The room design is flawed. There is no decent dressing table mirror in the aircon part of the room and the bathroom is like a sauna making it hard to dry hair and apply make up. Also very short on draw and hanging space.

We felt the room prices should have been around $150 to $180 per night and would have ranked it higher at this price point. Also had we been allocated a fully functional sea view room our opinion would have been better. Do consider the long drive from the airport if you are considering Aditya for a long weekend.","Not Quite Right","2012-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r143616394-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your valuable comments about Aditya. and it sure was a pleasure having you with us. 

To answer a few points you made about the suites and its availability, Sagara suites, which  have a sea view, are sold at a premium and guests are often not hesitant to pay a higher price for this added luxury. Usually we do not offer free upgrades if we have them available. 

The four course meals served at Aditya are competitively priced and are as we hear often, exceptionally good; some of the finest in the area.
 
We appreciate your  comments about our service. We pride ourselves on our service that is personal but not intrusive so as to allow our guests to feel the privacy that we have promised them. Staff is always at hand to cater to your requests. 
 
Aditya is an ideal location for relaxing and unwinding. We sincerely hope that we, at Aditya, did not fall short in this regard.

Expensive & less value for money overall.
Hotel has been designed aesthetically but does not have anything exceptionally different 
Few things which disappointed me are as following:
1. Little value of money: I think they are over priced for the rooms or decor they offer to the guest. They charged me $350 approx for a room when hotel had only 2 rooms occupied. I was booked for a room which was  $300 approx exclusive breakfast which was not sea facing. For sea facing room 'Smudra', they asked me to pay $50 additional when almost 90% hotel rooms were unoccupied. 
2. Less personal: Since it is boutique hotel with 12 rooms only & if you paying almost $ 350 a night, one would expect a hotel manager to at least come & greet/meet you for basic courtesies of asking how the guest is doing. Never happened. 
3. Food prices are way above in comparison to other similar hotels. A meal for two would cost you approx $150-200.

What I liked in the hotel are:
1. Great food: Didn't meet the chef, but food was excellent. Very well prepared food, delicious & extremely well presented. 
2. Restaurant Staff: Staff at restaurant was very courtesies & extremely attentive.  
3. Great view of ocean: View from the room was really good. It has huge balcony & view to ocean is very nice

They need to work on personalization of services for the guest & little bit on the prices. Value for money seems to missing. The upgradeable room with extra $50 each night still hurts as hotel had less than 10% occupancy. They need to be more accommodative to guest needs & desires rather than always thinking of money. 

Overall great hotel for relaxing for good 3-4 days. Food superb.","Less value for money overall - but great food","2011-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r114860780-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The Aditya is an ok hotel but worth about a quarter of the price it charges.  We started in a room with no view and a passageway used for (as far as we could gather) delivery lorries, rubbish bins and air conditioning units running alongside it.  After an evening here we moved (at additional, although discounted cost) to a suite that was far fancier, split level and with a fabulous view.

Both rooms, however, suffered from bathrooms that were completely open to the elements (I don't know if they have rooms without this feature).  While this might look exotic when you first see it you quickly realise some of the downsides...no temperature control and absolutely full of mosquitoes.

The other major disappointment was the plunge pools that each room, I believe, have.  Again, a fabulous enticement in a brochure but a freezing cold (again no temperature control) plunge pool isn't what you want unless it's sweltering outside and otherwise you are paying for a fancy feature you don't use.

The food was fine but not great and very pricey, as was Aditya in general.  It is also about 30 minutes from Galle so not great for sightseeing and the beach outside is almost non-existent (a very steep drop down to the sea caused by treacherously strong current) so you are confined to the (average, not overly new/clean) pool.

We have a large number of friends who have since been to Sri Lanka and have stayed at nicer, far far cheaper hotels.","Not fabulous.

The service was also very slow even though it was not particularly busy. We had to wait a long time for water, and even though we are a family of 5, we were initially seated on a small table and had to request to move.

Dear Management Team,

I recently visited Cinnamon Life Quizine and observed a concerning incident where managers reprimanded staff members in front of guests. This practice not only creates an uncomfortable atmosphere for diners but also impacts the morale of your staff and the reputation of your esteemed establishment.

I kindly request that you address this issue and provide your staff with the professional respect they deserve. A positive workplace environment will reflect well on the quality of service and guest experience. Food was good. But always water dripping from the roof top. Service also good. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Thank you for your review. Whilst we’re happy with most of your feedback of the Wallawwa, we are disappointed that your stay was not as wonderful as your visits to our sister hotels, Camellia Hills and Kumu Beach.

As you may know, the Wallawwa is an 18th century manor house that was transformed to an 18-bedroom boutique hotel, just over 10 years ago, preserving the colonial style and atmosphere of the 200 year old building. In contrast, Kumu Beach and Camellia Hills are both newly built properties, and hence are more contemporary in style and architecture. This could perhaps be one reason why you felt a difference in character between the properties.

A majority of our guests who have stayed at the Wallawwa, have praised it for its beautiful setting, fabulous food and stylish rooms, and ironically have regretted staying for just a night!

That being said, we too, have noticed a couple of cracked tiles inside and outside the pool, and due to the time duration it takes to replace the tiles (a couple of days from emptying the water in the pool and leaving the tiles to dry) the management have scheduled the maintenance work for the off season in May/June.

We’ve also noted your comments on the menu prices and the level of service and will ensure the service levels are up to the same standard as the rest of the Teardrop collection.

Finally we thank you for choosing to stay with us and wish you a safe journey onward.

The hotel is tucked away and it is quiet.  Both good things.  Possibly if you come here first, upon arriving in Sri Lanka, you might be impressed by the layout of the hotel.  However, arriving there from Camellia Hills, possibly one of the most fabulous places in the world, I was a touch disappointed.  The swimming pool is adequate, but a little tired looking, with quite a few cracked tiles.  The restaurant was okay, but the prices were high.

Thank you for reviewing us. We’re glad you liked the setting of the hotel, yet we feel a little hard done by your comments regarding the fogging and mosquito treatment.

As you witnessed, The Wallawwa is surrounded by over 6-acres of lush tropical gardens. Whilst this gives the hotel a beautiful atmosphere and feel, unfortunately it also attracts many bugs and insects including mosquitos. Fogging and pest control, although unappealing, is common and frequently carried out in environments such as ours, in order to prevent the mosquitos from being an annoyance to our guests.

Nonetheless we entirely agree that conducting fogging without informing any of our guests would be unethical and very unprofessional. It is for this reason, the team at Wallawwa stick to 3 methods of notifying our guests on the day the pest control has been scheduled. After discussing this matter internally, I can confirm that all 3 procedures had been carried out on the day you stayed with us. They are as follows – 
1. Informing the guest upon check-in regarding the pest control and fogging time (applies only if check in is on the same day).

2. Placing a letter in each room informing the guest of the mosquito treatment and fogging time. It reads as follows –
Dear Guest,
Welcome to the Wallawwa Hotel and thank you for choosing to stay with us.
Today we carry out our weekly mosquito treatment between 16:30 Hrs to 18:30 Hrs.
There will be no harm to the human body during the fogging period. So please feel free to use any of our facilities as usual.
I do apologise for any inconvenience. Please kindly speak to our Duty Manager or myself if you need further information.

3. Placing a note near the pool area that says “Pest Control in Progress” one hour before start time.

I would also like to share a short note from the Pest Control Agency regarding the composition of the fog used -

As per the discussion we had with our supplier, the level of toxicity for short exposure is minimal or negligible. Please find the following facts.
 
• This product is specifically used for the thermal fogging purpose registered in Sri Lanka under Pesticide Act of 1980.
• The dosage of chemical used per liter is very minimal (20 ml of chemical per 1 Liter diesel).
• The product is registered under Sri Lankan Pesticide act and being used by the Government authorities and pest control companies in Sri Lanka.

We sincerely apologise for the trouble you had with the coffee maker. Although housekeeping had checked the coffee machine during turn-down service and did not find any leaks, we still take full responsibility for this issue and will ensure the coffee makers are up to working standard. I would just like to confirm that it took approximately 5 minutes to replace the coffee machine (as per CCTV records). 

Linen replacement is an ongoing task where linen in poor condition is discarded and replaced with new linen. We have addressed this matter internally and the housekeeping team have been informed to ensure the linen is always fresh and crisp, otherwise, to be replaced if we find it to be a little tired.

Once again, I apologise that we could not make your stay perfect and hope the above justification will help to better understand that we meant no harm or disrespect to our guests during the mosquito treatment. If you have any additional feedback, please be kind enough to email me on mustafa@teardrop-hotels.com

Best regards,
The Wallawwa

It is a very pretty hotel however....
While relaxing at the pool on a Friday at 4:50 pm they sprayed/fogged for mosquitos completely polluting the air and making it impossible to breathe. The worst part was they didn’t warn the guests to take shelter and we had to breathe in the toxic fumes, all the while they insisted that it wasn’t poison. If not poisonous, how would it kill the bugs. 
The coffee maker in the room wasn’t working, leaking everywhere and when asked for a new one it took 15 minutes to get another one that also didn’t work. The person who came to replace it had difficulty plugging it in when all he had to do was move piece of furniture, which i ended up doing. This was most unpleasant, given we had to leave the hotel by 5 am. The sheets were like sand paper, very rough and uncomfortable, not something one would expect from a supposed high end hotel. We are so sorry we ever stayed there, making our last night of a beautiful vacation most unpleasant and uncomfortable.

Thank you for your comprehensive review of your stay at the Wallawwa. As much as we are delighted with some of your comments, we are also saddened to hear that your visit did not live up to the mark. We are constantly aiming to improve and thanks to your detailed feedback we are able to address your points with the relevant departments. We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience and hope you appreciate reading our response.

As you rightly mentioned, the Wallawwa is surrounded by acres of lush tropical gardens which in turn is also home to many birds, butterflies and unfortunately some creepy-crawlies. We do our best to ward off insects from getting inside the rooms (via scheduled pest control visits) however sometimes they do manage to find a way in. That being said, we agree that it is not pleasant for anyone to spot a cockroach at 2 in the morning or get bitten by ants by the pool and hence we will request the pest controller to focus more on the concerns raised.

Similarly, with regard to the mosquitoes, fogging is conducted on a weekly basis to prevent them from being an annoyance to the guests. Your comment has been duly noted and the hotel will monitor the situation carefully. When required, the frequency of fogging will be increased to twice a week. 

Our jungle pool has been praised numerous times for the serene atmosphere and shade it provides. We’d like to maintain that ambience but do apologise that it did not appeal to you.

Your comments on the room, bathroom and communal areas have been acknowledged, and you may be happy to note that the management plans to implement a soft refurbishment of the hotel in the coming months.

Thank you for your excellent feedback on the food and restaurant as well as the staff.

Our packed breakfast consists of sandwiches, yogurt and juice in addition to the cut fruits and croissants. It is against hotel policy that we allow it to be switched with dinner. We thank you for understanding.

Unfortunately the system generated invoice does not produce a breakdown with taxes. We will address this issue with the company managing the system. The airport transfer had been arranged accordingly but we admit that it was not added to the initial bill. We have already conducted a refreshment training to the Front Office team on billing procedures.

Once again we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience and hope that you would be back after the refurbishment to enjoy a better stay. Please contact me directly on mustafa@teardrop-hotels.com the next time you’d like to visit so I can ensure you are looked after.

All the best,
The Wallawwa

I can’t quite put my finger on it but it didn’t hit the spot. There’s no denying this is a great location in terms of quickly getting to Colombo airport - and it’s not an airport hotel next to a mass of car parks. It feels remote and much much further away but was less than 20mins in the morning. 

The grounds are pretty but not huge - but you do feel like you’re rather in the jungle. This was one hotel we stayed in that we felt the most bitten and has led by bugs and creatures. Of course I’m not knocking nature and what can a hotel do but it was mosquito heavy and the pool area was overrun with huge and small biting ants. Not pleasant. 

Also the pool was largely shaded by trees so every sunbed was in the shade and there were nowhere near enough sun beds for guests. There are other sunbeds randomly placed in the middle of the lawned gardens but that felt odd and slightly exposed. 

The communal public spaces felt very dated and dark and therefore unused. The room was a great size but again felt incredibly dated and not in a cool way. We had a small courtyard garden which we daren’t venture into because the amount of bugs trying to get in the glass door was enough to put you off opening it. The flooring in the bathroom was wooden slatted which clearly can hide a multitude of sins including one of the biggest cockroaches we’ve ever seen that greeted us during a 2am loo break. 

In truth this should have been a stunning bathroom but it felt dated and a little grubby with mouldy black marks around the sink and shower that absolutely could’ve been cleaned better over the years. 

The restaurant was good and busy - there’s nowhere else to go! But the food as with Fort Bazaar was excellent and the staff lovely. 

One annoyance was - like most people staying here - the breakfast which is part of the cost - is included but most don’t partake as they have an early flight. We asked if we could miss that and have some sort of discount on dinner but they absolutely refused arguing they would give us a breakfast parcel. An apple and a croissant doesn’t make up for what breakfast we clearly could’ve had and I do feel hotels that don’t let you opt out and have a small discount on dinner instead are being greedy. 

Checking out was also slightly painful. We booked using a travel site but after dinner were presented with an invoice showing room and dinner (and we assumed transport as we’d pre booked airport transfer when we checked in) all combined with no clear breakdown and no tax shown plus an odd discount they’d applied to apparently match the website we’d booked with. Basically we were presented with an invoice with one amount and wanted to know how it broke down to check it was right. This created much consternation on their part and the manager was called and a whole fuss about nothing ensued. 

All they needed to do was show each item without tax to make it clear. We paid but by sheer chance mentioned the airport transfer for 4:30am the next morning to discover they clearly hadn’t done that and hadn’t charged us so thank goodness we checked. Again it would’ve been clear had it been on the invoice. 

The next morning the driver took us to the airport but was one of those drivers that has clearly been told to drive British people slowly - despite the roads being completely empty we drove at 20km/hr which made the journey painful. 

This is a great luxury chain and in a superb location - it needs the same kind of design eye that Fort Bazaar has which retains the character but ups the luxury feel. This is not a cheap hotel and needs to up its game.

Thank you for your feedback via Trip Advisor.
We are, however, extremely disappointed to receive the low score you’ve given, particularly as we are being penalised for something that is, for the most part, out of our control.
 
As I’m sure you understand, we aren’t able to predict who guests are and how they’ll behave based on their pearl earrings or school reports, and can therefore only apologise that you were disturbed by this particular family and hope that you understand that this is not the norm. Our aim is to create a peaceful and friendly environment for travellers to relax and unwind before their onward journey.
 
I’m sure, had you voiced your disapproval at the time of your stay, a member of the team would have either tried to accommodate you in a quieter area of the hotel or could have asked the family to keep the volume down. If you have any further feedback as to how you feel we can improve, or have dealt with the matter at the time, please do contact me directly on henry@teardrop-hotels.com. I’d also appreciate it if you could let me know the exact date of your stay, so I can check our daily report to see if anything has been recorded.
 
Warm regards,
Henry

It is. A beautiful hotel, well positioned near the airport and an ideal place to start or end your tour of Sri Lanka. Delicious food, nice rooms, welcoming staff, charming grounds.

My issue with the place is that it tends to attract a certain kind of clientele. During our stay these tended to be the kind of person who felt, because they had paid a reasonably high rate, were very entitled. Whacking cricket balls on the lawn without respect for others with a  ""you had better get out of my way"" attitude. Organising competitive swimming races in the reasonably tiny pool as though it belonged to them and them alone. Talking in a very loud voice about their various status symbols. I think you know the type. 

Then there is Sir Bufton Tufton and his wife, crotchety-faced retirees desperate to recreate the days of the British Empire and looking down their noses at people who don't wear a tie and a blazer for dinner (or pearls in the case of Mrs Tufton).

If you are the sort of person who enjoys taking part in this  social dance, or can manage to ignore it, then this place is for you. Maybe as a couple of nights luxury in an otherwise more characterful journey around the island. But compared to the many other welcoming and friendly places we visited in Sri Lanka I would say the somewhat stand- offish attitude of the guests spoiled an otherwise tranquil and elegant place to stay.","Beautiful hotel, not very nice clientele","2017-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1990730-d1380568-r522176993-Wallawwa-Kotugoda_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review. Whilst we're disappointed to be rated as a '3 out of 5', the feedback provided helps us to improve. 

I'm very sorry to hear about the issues you faced. I agree that it’s unacceptable that an unclean cup was left next to the coffee machine and that the shower in the second bathroom was blocked. This was clearly a mistake of the housekeeping team and we’ve already addressed this with them, so that it doesn’t happen again.

With regards to the linen, it is always, without fail, changed prior to a new arrival. While I apologise if it didn’t smell fresh, we could have easily arranged a new set for you if you’d mentioned it to a staff member at the time. As the Hotel Manager told you, we were aware of the stain on the daybed in the master bedroom, hence it being covered with a clean sheet. Unfortunately, it’s taken a while to get the tailor to reupholster the cushion, but it has now been done. I appreciate this is too late for your stay in early December, and apologise that it wasn’t done in time.

I hope you had a fantastic time in Sri Lanka and that we may have the opportunity to welcome you back to The Wallawwa in the future, to show how things have already improved.

That's where my compliments end. The two beds in the secondary bedroom did not smell as though the linens were clean. So I ended up sleeping in the main bedroom with my friend--not exactly ideal. There were very visible stains on a cushion covering a day bed. There was a dirty, used mug by the coffee machine. Finally, the second bathroom was unusable because the shower drain was clogged. I flooded the second bathroom and bedroom before realizing this. Management was nice, but it still doesn't take away from the fact that there were so many problems. He claimed that all of the rooms were going to get new cushions, thus the stains would no longer be a problem. That's great for future guests, but it still didn't take away from the fact that I stayed in a room with dirty cushions, dirty beds, dirty coffee cups and a clogged drain.","Potential to be 5-star, but ...","2016-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1990730-d1380568-r449268886-Wallawwa-Kotugoda_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your feedback and I am really pleased you enjoyed your stay at the Wallawwa. However, I am sorry that you felt the issue with the unanswered phone call detracted from the enjoyment of your stay. We are a small boutique property where all the staff members work very hard in all parts of the hotel. The levels of service are always very high and I know that a ringing phone would not remain unanswered unless all the staff were very busy. Our staff always try to help and have our guests' best interest in mind, so saying 'Very good' to a complaint was due to English being their second language and an unfortunate misunderstanding.

However, we do appreciate your feedback and will look into both these issues and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Wallawwa in the future.

Our friends who had arrived earlier told us they had heard the phone ringing but no-one went near it! Charming.

The air conditioning was awful. It kept turning itself off and my wife and I took it in turn to reset it. There were no instructions in the room and we were not given a demonstration when we arrived at our room. Needed extra towels the next morning as we both needed showers before leaving.

When paying at the Restaurant after breakfast for our stay, I was asked if everything was OK and I said that we liked the food and the bedroom but found it frustrating not to be able to get to speak to anyone on the phone and the guy said, ""very good"".

After what will be quite a long flight for most Europeans, a short  transfer is usually preferable, and this was only 20 minutes. The rooms are spacious, well laid out and include a fridge with some complimentary soft drinks.
Air conditioning is standard, views are nothing special, in fact ours was not much more than 3 meters of garden and a wall.
The hotel has a good outdoor pool and mature gardens. Unfortunately, on the day of our visit, they had opened up to a corporate function (Swedish car manufacturer) so the guests were rather an 'inconvenience' whilst they gave over the gardens for afternoon tea with the 30+ delegates.
Our afternoon tea was laid out in a side room but unfortunately they had omitted to cover the food, and flies were feeding from it by the time we arrived! As I pointed out to the member of staff I spoke to, this sort of basic hygiene mistake leads one to wonder what might be happening in the kitchens.
The hotel staff were all very helpful, and the restaurant meals were very good.

Also noticed there was no spray or insect repellant unit that you plugged in at night (we had these in other hotels) and I was woken by the sound of mosquitoes in the night.

Thank you for your review. Whilst we're disappointed to be rated as a '3 out of 5', the feedback provided helps us to improve.  
We’re delighted you enjoyed your meals with us. We spend a great deal of time and effort ensuring that our food is not only excellent, but is sourced as locally as possible – much of it from our own fruit and vegetable garden.
I’m very sorry to hear that you didn’t like our bathrooms. The vast majority of our guests (as many reviews show) love the generous space, with natural light from the skylight and the double terrazzo basins and huge rainshowers. 
I can assure you that the cool hand towels provided upon arrival are laundered each and every time. Having said that, we’ve been through our collection, since this feedback, and discarded a few that had permanent stains on them. I apologise that these were even used in the first place – they should have been pulled out of circulation.
I hope you had a fantastic time in Sri Lanka and that we may have the opportunity to welcome you back to The Wallawwa in the future so you can see the changes we’ve made.
Warm regards,
Henry

Although the property is quiet and quaint, we felt the lodging was average at best. The guest rooms lacked ambiance with cement floors and cavernous shower floors. Furthermore, the bathrooms sported mold on the floors. Hygiene issues also included serving visibly dirty white ""refreshing"" towels upon arrival. We were expected to wipe these towels over our faces and hands, yet they clearly were not laundered between guests. Yuk!

Thank you for your review. Though we're disappointed to be rated as a '3 out of 5', the feedback provided helps us to improve and we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with other Trip Advisor users. 

As mentioned to you in my email, we have taken all of your points on board and will make improvements to our service levels where necessary. Although it is no excuse, we were short staffed in our Welcome Pavilion on the day of your arrival and this seems to have affected the friendly welcome and departure every guest usually receives.

We stayed in the Mountbatten Suite for 1 night prior to leaving Sri Lanka at the end of a 10 day visit. The room is beautiful but we were let down by the very poor service.

On arrival the reception desk was not staffed. I unloaded the bags from our vehicle and our driver left. I waited for a few minutes for someone to come and then started trying to work the phones in the back office. Eventually someone came to ask us what we wanted. Not what you expect when you are paying over $400 per night. We were then shown around our room by a ""butler"" who seemed oblivious to the river of water across the room caused by the A/C. I asked one of the cleaning staff if they could help with this and he and a friend arrived immediately and fixed it - they provided the best and most efficient service of our stay. One of the bulbs in the bathroom was not working either. We loved the private garden and plunge pool that came with the suite but were surprised by how dirty the loungers were and our enjoyment was curtailed by the bonfire lit outside which meant we had to leave our garden early. The smell of burning tyres was still there in the morning.

I then went to try and print out boarding passes. There was no paper or ink in the printer. I had to go to the central office 3 times to get this fixed. Four staff were in the office. The first time a lady answered the door quite quickly and asked another staff member to fix things but they didnt. On the 2 subsequent occasions I had to knock 3 times before anyone even looked up from their desks (there is a glass door so it isn't as though they couldn't see me!). I suspect I was interrupting busy people but it wasn't clear where else to get help.

The food in the restaurant was good and the kitchen clean and efficient. The waiters were however poorly trained. They were very helpful and pleasant but didn't know what they were doing. At lunch we sat down and ordered. The waiter needed to go to the kitchen 5 times to find out if food was available (it was) and then brought us the wrong thing despite me correcting him 3 times and pointing at the menu. The first thing to arrive were our drinks which took 45 minutes to arrive (4 lime sodas!).

After dinner (also excellent but with very slow service) we were offered the opportunity to pay the bill for our whole stay which I did but our waiter didn't know how to use the credit card machine. After breakfast I said to one of the red shirted staff (butlers I think) that we were leaving - they said goodbye and didn't offer to help with the bags. I therefore went down with my family to the transport booked for the airport and a member of staff came running down just as I was dragging the bags back to the car. I pointed out that the lack of staff at reception on arrival and departure made the hotel seem unwelcoming. He told me they dont staff reception and he would ""pass my message on"". I suggest the staff in the main office take turns greeting guests unless of course they are too senior for this.

Overall this is one of the most beautiful hotels I have been to and the food is good. Food service is slow which I can understand as everything is freshly cooked. I cant understand why 30 minutes was the quickest it took for drinks to arrive. The staff (with the exception of the staff in the main office) are friendly and kind but its clear they are poorly lead. They are insufficiently trained and the reception and departure arrangements are incompetent and leave you feeling cheated and unwelcome.","Missed opportunity.........","2013-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1990730-d1380568-r183026082-Wallawwa-Kotugoda_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review on Trip Advisor - we’re glad you liked the architecture, peacefulness and proximity to the airport of The Wallawwa. 

We have taken on board the feedback provided and will use your comments to improve. I should, however, take a moment to explain that we are a small boutique hotel and do not promise buffet style food generally served at larger hotels around the island. In our opinion, and that of the majority of our guests, this is a positive. For breakfast we offer a fruit juice, fruit platter, tea/coffee, homemade bread and croissants and an array of additional dishes such as Eggs Benedict, French Toast and Tropical Granola with curd & honey, to name a few. All served to your table while you can sit back and enjoy the beautiful gardens.

Some of the improvements you suggest are already in progress. Mini fridges are soon to be fitted in every room and we are working hard to persuade Sri Lanka Telecom to increase our bandwidth for better wifi (which is offered free of charge throughout the property). I apologise that the connection was slow when you stayed with us.

I hope you have an excellent tour of Sri Lanka and that we may have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future to show you the improvements we’ve made.

Warm regards,
Henry

It should be ideal for a night or two, a bit dull maybe. But the place has several issues, some of them are just very unusual or plainly not acceptable for a property at this price level:
- no refrigerator, no minibar
- nice big bathroom but no power outlet and no bathtub
- we are used to getting a fruit basked or some chocolates or a bottle of wine at arrival: nothing here
- Just soap, conditioner and shampoo in the bathroom, no other amenities
- Walking to breakfast you need to pass by the kitchen which did not look clean and neat
- breakfast was substandard. It is waiter service, no buffet. They only have one local dish (out of around 6 you can order) - and that one was not available. No ham, no cold-cuts, only one cheese (cheddar). They charge extra for several items (like cappuccino or orange juice - very unusual for a place this expensive

Thank you for your review of The Wallawwa via Trip Advisor. We’re delighted you found the rooms comfortable and enjoyed our beautiful gardens and your breakfast.

With regards to your comments about the transfers, I must point out that no-one at the hotel is ‘making some extra money’ and, at present, there is no freeway into Colombo. I believe on the day you travelled into town there was a detour due to some construction work on the freeway that is being built (due to open later this year) and therefore the driver had to take you an alternative route – this, I’m sure, would have taken longer than the usual 45-60 minutes it takes from The Wallawwa to the city centre. It should also be noted that our transport rates are lower than the charges of other hotels in the city. The Kingsbury, for example, charge US$50 (approx. Rs 6,250) for an airport transfer, which is roughly the same distance as from The Wallawwa into Colombo. As you mention, we do recommend using our hotel transfers for airport pick ups and drops to ensure the driver knows exactly where he’s going and so that he will be in the arrivals hall to meet guests who pre-book this service. 

The liquor license we hold allows us to keep the bar open until midnight (extensions can be granted with prior approval), therefore I’m afraid it was not possible to serve your husband a beer upon arrival without risking losing our license and incurring heavy fines. I apologise that the Butler didn’t explain this to you more clearly at the time.

With the above in mind, I hope you feel that our team did everything they could to ensure your stay was as enjoyable and comfortable as possible and I’m sorry for any shortcomings on our side. 

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future to improve your impression of The Wallawwa.

Warm regards,
Henry

For us this was a mistake, as at this time of night the traffic is light and we could have spent 5 nights at the Kingsbury instead of the 4 we booked. The Wallawwa is everything that is described in the other reviews, the room is large and comfortable, the huge concrete bathroom I found cold and mortuary like, but this was made up for by the lovely gardens and wonderful breakfast in the  morning. Because many flights arrive and depart after midnight, we heard planes overhead before finally dozing off. Late morning we asked for a taxi to take us into Colombo - it cost 5600 rupees instead of the 3000 I had been advised, so some-one at the Hotel is making some extra money. Also the driver refused to take the freeway, so we had to suffer horrendous stop/start traffic for over an hour. 
My advice if you are going into Colombo, is just take the trip straight in  from the Airport and arrive at your Colombo address late but then you are settled. My husband wanted a beer before bed but the bar at the Wallawwa was closed and no effort was made to accommodate him. The Sky Bar at the Kingsbury is open all night, and that would have been an amazing way to start our Sri Lankan 4 week holiday. Also get your hotel to pick you up at the Airport - there is no obvious taxi rank and again we were ripped off by a driver taking us to the Wallawa. We knew that we paid too much (3000 rupees instead of probably1200 as advised by Sri Lankan friends) but we were just too tired to haggle.","Ripped off by transportation Costs","2013-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1990730-d1380568-r163335457-Wallawwa-Kotugoda_Western_Province.html",

Initial reception is really lukewarm: smallish pool (with exactly 2 loungers) near the entrance hence no secluded atmosphere, not too big rooms (but comfy beds, and small balconies for the ground floor ones). However good wifi and bathroom. No hair dryers however, a shame. Staff is friendly except the tyrannic GM which holds office in the reception area, hardly welcomes the guests, and consistently shouts to all staff and in his phone calls. Might be good in his job, but creates terribly bad PR for his 3 Heritage hotels in the same street.
Impression worsens as the cook partly spoilt the set menu dinner with soup exploding from black pepper and lukewarm Lankan mains. Chinese-style mains and desserts were much better. (Note all is veggie-only, a rule from the municipality for all food sold within 1 km from the temple.) Buffet breakfast next morning, with bread, fresh fruit and Lankan stuff, was again decent. Did not eat the HB dinner for 2nd night as we had something to celebrate outside.

The room is spacious, with a double and a single bed. Small fridge and TV with sports channels. Good WiFi..Two chairs. We had a small outside area but it was close to the road and a bit noisy. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very small with very narrow entrance to the toilet. Good shower. I am not sure if more corpulent people than us could cope. Our main problem was the noise caused by a kind of generator that switched on and off. Not so nice during the night.

The swimming pool is small and doesn’t look very attractive. No seats in the shade.

Breakfast was OK, with toast, cornflakes and some curry’s. No eggs (not that we missed these)
We had diner twice. We were on an HB-arrangement and had the set menu.
The first evening was a shamble. It took them ages to prepare and it opened near 19:45. They forgot to bring the rice and another dish. The curry tasted nice but the portions were too small for us. Staff didn’t look as they were in control. It was quite busy (Saturday night)
On the second evening (Monday) we were the only guests and we could use the a la carte menu. The soup was nice and so were the curries (mixed vegetable and mushroom). My wife liked the Indian dessert but that was too sweet for me.
So two totally different experiences.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, but they seemed inexperienced or somewhat shy. The language barrier is also bit of a problem.  The manager speaks English reasonable well but the other staff doesn’t.","Small, clean, friendly hotel.

Now that we have been a few more days in Sri Lanka,we think the food in restaurant can be better.  e.g. the curd we had was very watery.

Cons: the room itself was spacious enough but the furnishings are 'tired'. Little evidence that the room servicing staff ever entered the rather cramped bathroom.  Was a little surprised to find I had to produce an empty shower gel bottle to get a refill!
There is a 'small' swimming pool but only 3 loungers...wooden slats and no cushions! A few garden chairs and loungers around the pool would provide somewhere to sit other than in the room or reception!

Since there is peace the people have to get used to receiving tourists again. Same applies for the staff in this sympathetic hotel. Given the important temple nearby there are tight rules with respect to serving meat and alcohol. That is not a problem, since the hotel offers all kinds of dinner at a location at tuktuk distance. So there we found ourselves having a private dinner under the porch of a nearby villa. Really special, although it prooved to be rather difficult to eat crab with bare hands. Rooms are good, although it is strange that there is a balcony, but no door to reach it. Pool is rather strangely located at the front, where are the accompanying chairs? And we would rather have the staff come up with a helpful solution in stead of just saying there is no laundry service.

Visited the hotel with a group of friends for 2 nights. The hotel staff were very attentive during the check in process and to complete all the formalities.

The hotel is situated on a large and expansive area bordering the Kandalama tank which means you get to see some wildlife around.

The rooms we got were chalets which were large and had a sitting area outdoors as well.

Unfortunately the furniture within the rooms need a thorough renovation. One of the beds we got started sagging after lying down while the furniture and tiles within the washrooms were cracked or had decayed.

A little pest control in the rooms would also be useful to get rid of geckos that are roaming around. 

The dinner and breakfast buffets had quite a lot of variety and food tasted good.

We didn't have a chance to check out the pool and other facilities as we were on the move most of the trip. 

Would return again, but it would be nice if the management paid more attention to the amenities. ","Nice location, but needs some attention","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r1003501827-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

It is peaceful and pretty. Rooms are chalet type set out in a large area, some quite a walk to the facilities. However, you can request a golf buggy as a taxi to and fro.

However, the room we were in (60) was a little tired, especially the shower; the tiles and cubicle needed a deep clean. The food was ok but never very hot. Breakfast was not great. I was especially disappointed that there was no nice bread to have with cheese etc. Only very dry, sliced bread was available for breakfast, although lovely, fresh bread was available at lunch and dinner. Cereals were basic, cornflakes and some chocolate things, which weren't very nice. The jam was fluorescent, definitely not good quality.

The location of the hotel is beautiful with large grounds overlooking the lake. The swimming pool is excellent. The staff are friendly and efficient.
The not so good points. The accommodation was the poorest and most basic we encountered in Sri Lanka and little things spoke volumes e.g. no shower gel in a supposedly freshly prepared room. A dark damp patch running around the wall of the bathroom. However the principal issue is the restaurant. It is buffet style at both breakfast and dinner; however with a number of large groups in the hotel, they descended en masse & hoovered up almost everything. Replenishment was slow or non-existent; so for later diners choice was limited. Food quality was at best average, it's the first time I've seen jelly on a dessert choice since I was a child!

Pros:

5. You're fully immersed in nature. Great place to watch birds. 

Cons:
1. The villas are quite old and have a leaking issue. On the day we checked in, we had gotten a villa that had a serious leak from the roof while it heavily rained outside. The leak was falling directly onto the bed. Thankfully, they accommodated our request to be moved to a different villa.
2. Rooms are slightly dusty, and the amenities fall short.

Why not ambient background music?  The noise just ruined it for me. ","Resort not nightclub ","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r930957537-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

Get a Signature Suite if you can.","Value","4","Location","5","Service","4",,,,,,,"We stayed three nights on a tour of Sri Lanka and so have five other hotels with which to compare.

Firstly, the good points : the food ! The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet was to die for ! Both Sri Lankan and western tastes are catered for, the quality is up to the standard of almost anywhere else we ate, the range of dishes on offer enormous. The semi-outdoor setting was lovely too. Apart from the incentive to grossly overeat, there was only one problem - live music on the second night, a cringeworthy easy listening repertoire delivered shockingly out of tune, which spoiled the meal. (But the following evening, a Sri Lankan folk ensemble was much better). 

Service was mostly good, but let down occasionally. One evening in the bar area (not busy), we waited 20 minutes to be served, then gave up and went for dinner.

The grounds are extensive and beautiful with birdsong punctuating views of the lake through the tall trees. A buggy service (usually very prompt) is offered for any journeys within the grounds, essential as our villa was the furthest from the main building. although sometimes it was more pleasant to walk.

 Although we never used the main pool or spa, we discovered a second, smaller swimming pool and outdoor lounge area nearer to our room, which was quieter and very secluded.

Now for the not-so-good parts : the room (no. 71). Despite being called a Deluxe Villa. I would not describe it as such - definitely the least well appointed of all our hotel rooms. Decor was tired, side of bath had a hole in it lacked a plug, nowhere to hang laundry, insufficient natural light getting into the room, so that it felt oppressive. The advertised minibar was an empty fridge that leaked. The thing I missed most compared with our other hotels was any outdoor table & chairs with the room. My wife viewed a  Signature Suite which had outdoor seating. Next time we would opt for one of those (at a considerable price premium). 

All in all, the room features let this hotel down, but if you can afford a Signature Suite it could be a great stay.","Great food and grounds but disappointing room (not deluxe in our opinion).","2023-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r929026958-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

My colleagues and I arrived at Amaya Lake hotel on the eve of 2nd of December 2022 and we stayed till 4th Sunday morning. When we arrived, we were tried from the long journey and reception welcomed us with a warm and welcoming smile. Cold towel and herbal tea offered to us certainly lift our weary spirts up and I was feeling enthusiastic of our stay at your hotel. Staff was welcoming and helpful and we were in our room (Number 324) soon. The room was clean and magnificent and at that time I was already making plans to visit here with my girlfriend for a few days of nice and relaxing vacation. Since it was late night and we were all tired, we ordered some room service and few beverages. 

The food was … well, I don’t know what to say other than it is not enough, It is amusing and shocking to realize that for a such a reputed luxury hotel, you don’t have sea food options. Only one of us ordered Chicken. But it had more bones in than actual, edible meat. It should be noted that when we received our beverages we did ask for a bottle opener and were told one is available in the bathroom. When we look for it, not only we couldn’t find it and when we called reception to inquire about it, we were told the same. “It’s in the bathroom” phrase. Your staff didn’t seem to bother to ask if we found it or need one. 

Next morning, I was stunned by the scenery of the place and spent some time by the Kandalama Lake. Hotel was full of beauty of nature and we all were impressed by it. In contrast, the breakfast buffet was rather disappointing. We knew breakfast buffet ends at 10.30 AM and arrived around 10.00 AM. We had very limited amount of food choices to make, Soup bowls are nearly empty and so is the many food items. That left me and few other guests dumbfounded. Fruit juice containers also nearly empty and someone placed wrong names on them. It could be a prank by anyone and I fell for it. I went for an orange juice and ended up drinking something unpleasant for my taste. Needless to say when I left, I was feeling rather hungry despite the fact that I just finished my breakfast.  

After that disappointing breakfast buffet, we tried to play pool. While we did have fun playing the game, it’s somehow felt we were in a confined space because information board and concrete pole sometimes gotten the way of cue sticks. I would suggest to move the table bit away. And please fix the floor or adjust the table because we did observe some of the pool balls curve their path when moving like Murli’s doosra. Also why you keep push bicycles chained? I really fancy a ride on one of those but seeing they chained I changed my mind. I can only imagine what a beautiful ride it might be if I actually took a ride. I don’t know why you do that but I really didn’t want the hassle of finding someone to unchain them. A hotel should be in my opinion, a nice, relaxing place and inviting to any to spend some quality time. Those chains, to me give different idea like “hey, we got some fun stuff to do, but you need our permission to do that”. I think I’ll pass, thank you.

Before we arrived for the lunch buffet, we were in our room and ordered a buggy to our room because we are far away to walk for lunch. Fortunately, when we left our room, there was a buggy waiting. The driver didn’t seem to care about us and was talking with the security officers nearby and then was on a call with someone else. It was clear the buggy wasn’t for us but he was kind enough to give us a ride.

Time we were at your hotel, there were few cooperate events being held and it is beginning to dawn to us even the buffet was made to match these events, regardless of other guests in the hotel. Lunch was again a disappointment. I was not very impressed with your food choices. Going out to eat is life’s simple pleasures. It’s one of the joys of life. But coming to such a highly reputed and recommended place and leaving half filled stomach and wandering why on earth someone spend so much money to feel unfulfilled is not an impression anyone wants to experience. But on the pulse side, if you see the situation as hilarious as it is to us, the mystery of the bottle opener deepened again as we were once again told by the hotel “it’s in the bathroom”. Your staff spectacularly failed to notice when we keep asking for it, there might be a bit of an issue there.

Late afternoon three of decided to go to swimming pool. Soon as we got there, it’s started to rain. Then the pool is closed. Now, I understand why many hotels or public swimming pools don’t let you swim when it rains. I absolutely have no issue with that. If it is your rule, yes it is the rule. But when one of your staff tell us “You should have come earlier” in an insulting manner. I have to ask you, is this how they treat your customers? We all felt he was way over the line with the way he speak. We payed to stay at your hotel. Not a bunch of freeloaders. His conduct was appalling. Also I have to ask, where you keep towels when someone in the swimming pool needs one. We didn’t see any available near pool area. We were wet due to rain and we had to ask for towels from the spa. Scent of the Ayurveda oil is hard to ignore on those towels but at that time they are the only one available. 

As the night falls, we went to hotel bar. Since one of our colleague is still in the room, we asked for a buggy to be sent to pick him up. We inquired about it from the staff multiple times. In the end after more than half an hour, our colleague had to walk to the hotel bar from his room (324). Needless to say the risk he was under when he was walking in the dark because I happen to see snake on road during day time and at night lights of the lamps are not enough to walk especially if your room is far away from buffet hall as ours was. Near our room, some of the lamps are not working and ones that do work, their light is clearly inefficient. While these lights dose seems beautiful, it doesn’t offer much visibility to walk. 

Your staff seems to favor foreign gusts more than the local gusts and they gave us the impression that they consider we were also the part of cooperate group in the hotel and seems fine to ignore us and our requests. When we did buy drink from the bar, we did have to ask for the bites as it seems they would not provide any if we didn’t ask for it. They even removed the ash tray on the table. Your staff at the bar can see we are smoking and we don’t have an ash tray, not bothered to provide one. 

When we went to the dinner buffet, the hall was full and supervisor there ask us to wait for five minutes. It’s only after half an hour later and hall was half empty when they remembers to call us. I wasn’t expecting mush for the dinner and again I was proven right. It is astonishing to stay in a big hotel and see no sea food, eggs or even sausages. There, we did inform the manager what a disappointment this stay has been to us. Later I saw the manager telling his staff to bring more food to the buffet as there were many empty bowls.

Back in the room we opened the liquor we brought with us and ordered some bites. This time, cashew nuts and fish were good. But the potato chips were bit damp. One who brought the food also had a bottle opener with him and but since we opened our bottles with our teeth, took it back with him. We knew of course he only brought it here because we complained to manager. At this point we asked ourselves, dose this hotel have enough bottle openers or ones that available was made of exotic material to leave in a room?  

Even before 6 AM next morning, we were awakened by ringing of the phone from the reception to inform phone line is connected. This was clearly meant for another guest but we were feeling too sleepy to point it out. Again sleep was disturbed by knocking on the door from one of your staff to deliver us water bottles that we didn’t ask for. Later I heard from the staff that the guest who ordered the water bottle actually had to walk up to reception for his order. The neglect your staff shows to your guests is appalling. 

Last morning of our stay, I am glad to say we saw some sausages. We had our breakfast, payed our bills and left. 

If anyone making plans to stay there, I tell you this. If you are a local, go there to spend the night only because to the staff there local guests not worth their time. If you are foreigner, by all means go there. It’s a beautiful place and staff is kind and friendly. You will most certainly have a wonderful time there.

Bring your own liquor and a bottle opener (just in case). Make sure ash tray is there before you smoke. The food, ah, I honestly felt more hungry there than anyplace else. Food options really needs to improve there. If you are a foody, go someplace else, this is not the place for you unfortunately. Also, please go early to your buffet. 

Another astonishing thing is that for such a big land, there was only 4 electrical buggies are available. How they manage the crowds when in full capacity is unimaginable. Some of the staff really needs to learn how to talk with local customers and how to treat them. They also needs to be more responsive, the amount of neglect and carelessness we experienced is baffling. Also if you wants to go swimming, go there before evening, unless you wants a lecture from the reproachful pool guy. Before dive in to the pool, find a towel because we have no idea where they were kept.

I should also caution you to be very careful if your room have a wooden bridge nearby. When it rains there, the wooden bridge is very slippery. I believe all of us at some time, were about to fall down there. Fortunately, none of us fell down there but the risk of injury is there. 

One of us already booked a room to stay in the hotel and after our experience, he ended up canceling the booking. I am sure many felt the same. I hope someone will look in to the things I pointed here and do something about it. But before I wrote this review, I take a look at Booking.com about your hotel. Even there, only foreigners seems to have good words to say. Isn’t that a big issue? If you only wants foreigners to serve, then ban us, the locals from going there. If not, please get your act together and address these issues I pointed.","Definitely unquestionably unforgettable experience !","2022-12","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r871873383-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

- A lot of tour bus tourists. They are playing loud music with their own radio at the pool and the staff is doing nothing. It’s next to the massage area… doesn’t make any sense. 
- Can be difficult to find a chair at the pool when all the bus tour tourists are there. 
- Some clients of the hotel don’t wear a mask at the buffet. They pick up the food from the counter without their mask and with their hands (without the utensils).  Please put more utensils at the buffet and ask everyone to wear their mask as it’s written before you enter the restaurant.

Thus, I have a baseline to compare to. Accommodations in a good location and rooms are noise isolated. There is a shopping mall next to the hitel with a supermarket in the basement. The view to the skyline of Colombo is amaizing. I arrived in a group of 16 people. In other hotels, each piece of luggage gets a paper tag attached where the room number is written to identify the owner. This hotel doesn't use its own tags but relies on one's from previous hotels. The situation got even more messy at departure, where the luggage of our group was mixed with the ones of the other hotel guests. It cost us time to screen and segregate. Baggage handling definitely needs to be optimized and improved. The disadvantage of breakfast is the missing self-service for coffee and tea. One has to order and wait. I asked 3 different servants and had to wait almost to the end of my breakfast before I got my cup of hot milk. 
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool was great.","Pay attention to your luggage at this hotel","2025-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r988353401-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Unfortunately, due to various problems with two separate rooms (e.g., AC noise, pool music noise, mildew smell, and leaking shower), I checked out only after one night, and I moved to the nearby Colombo Sheraton. Why would a new hotel have these problems? I lowered my overall TA rating due to the room issues. I am a Marriott Bonvoy status member, so I received benefits during my stay.

Despite the problems with both rooms, this hotel is one of nicest Courtyards I've ever encountered in my worldwide travels. It's fairly new, and it's situated on the 9th through 17th floors of a shopping mall and residential high-rise. It's located within quick tuk-tuk access to Colombo's major sights. All services, including a well-equiped gym (didn't use), outdoor pool, lobby, restaurant, and bar, are located on the 9th floor. The 9th floor is impressively designed, with high ceilings and stone/marble throughout.

I used my Marriott suite certificate to upgrade to a Premium Corner room. The room was somewhat small, but nicely laid out, in a more modern Courtyard standard (e.g., not necessarily high-end, but comfortable, nonetheless). The small bathroom was only average, and I didn't like the small shower stall. The bed was super comfortable, and the pillows were great. Other than the noise, the AC worked great.

I had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant. Both were outstanding. The staff was also outstanding throughout the entire hotel, and they were so so accommodating.","Disappointed","2024-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r946689192-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

All arrangements were made via emails which were copied to multiple recipients in the hotel for their information. However the weekend staycation was a total nightmare with many shortcomings & lapses. 
Checked-in on Sunday where the welcome was painstakingly slow. Although the reservation was done via email weeks ahead, it appeared that the check-in was cumbersome. While certain guests were offered welcome drinks, we were left unattended. The front desk failed to send our luggage to our room after scanning where I had to run down to the lobby & request them to be delivered to the room since they were left unattended. 
Entertained some friends for Brunch which was exceptional. At breakfast on the birthday, we were told that breakfast is only complimentary for one person & that we will have to pay for 2 other guests when the package clearly stipulated bed & breakfast for two. Thereafter we were unceremoniously stopped at the entrance to the Beira Kitchen & were asked to settle the bill as we were leaving. Knowing the room number & with my instructions to the restaurant manager to issue the bill, the staff handled the situation in an unprofessional manner. The restaurant manager appeared to be busy having conversations with other guests while keeping us waiting for the receipt.
The hotel had more surprises in store for us at the checkout. The email clearly stipulated that the whole package was Rs. 30,900/- but I was asked to pay Rs. 32,400++ which I politely declined. This was clearly predatory pricing where the hotel had already advertised a promotional price of Rs. 28,888/- for the same packaged using the period of my stay.
I expected it to be a memorable staycation especially since my birthday coincided with the stay, but it was a disaster. The hotel staff was inhospitable & rude. They clearly lacked training. I am hence reluctant to recommend this hotel for staycations. There are other better hotels in Colombo which would look after & treat guests with utmost respect.
However I should compliment the chef for the lovely spread at Brunch & the room staff for keeping rooms tidy & clean.","Disappointed 😞 ","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r905462120-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Hence Courtyard is classified under the select range & the quality of service is contrastingly different from that of Ritz-Carlton & Sheraton which are upscale hotels. The Courtyard by Marriot, Colombo is one of Marriot's mid-priced brands. However I was craving for a hearty dinner at the ""Beira Kitchen"" which I visited with some of my other foodie friends. Although i had booked a table, we were shifted from one table to another since the first was occupied by other guests. It was a very limited spread with soups, salads, continental, Indian, & Sri Lankan mains, & a dessert section. However the food was average. The buns at the soups section were dry. The spread of salads were very limited & certain salads did not taste right. Certain dishes were empty & they were not refreshed or removed. The mains were also average since both the pork dishes were overcooked. I would love to have a nice juicy pork rib with a good barbeque sauce but the pork they served was dry. The biryani & the other accompaniments at the Indian section were delicious. I loved the mousse cakes at the dessert bar. Unfortunately the action stations were unmanned. Even the crepe & waffle stations were unattended. I had to wait & search for a chef to prepare pasta & kottu which were not upto expectation. Although kottu tasted ok, the pasta lacked seasoning. Presentation of both the dishes were not upto standard & completely different from the way they serve in videos on YouTube & how they advertise on social media.  However the chef suggested that they have a wider spread on Sundays at Brunch which I would love to try!","An Average Dinner Buffet 🥂","2023-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r881376145-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

This place is suitable for couples, families and small groups of friends. This is definitely one of Colombo’s happening places! We loved the atmosphere and welcoming hospitality of staff.
However, the food was not up to the expected standard. Being a Marriott Hotel we expected the food to taste better as in other Marriott Hotels. We visited on 11th Feb. Night for dinner and ordered from the Ala Carte Menu - the menu has a wide range of options to chose from. What made the experience upsetting is, we had to wait 20-30 minutes for a server to take our order and nearly another hour for the order to be served. 
I believe it was the head chef who came and spoke to us in the interim and apologised for the delay - in fact he asked us whether we would like to have a salad or a soup from the buffet on the house (which was really nice and thoughtful of him) and requested the server to serve it ASAP. But it look nearly another 20 minutes for the server to serve the soup from the buffet. 
We felt that the kitchen is understaffed or for some reason they couldn’t manage the high amount of Ala Carte orders that came in that time while running the buffet - something that should be looked into to.
To top it off I ordered Chicken breast with potato fries but what I received was Chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I guess the order was mixed up with the busy kitchen. We didn’t make a fuzz about it at the time as to get the potato fries it might take another 30 minutes and we couldn’t wait that long.

Despite how busy the restaurant was that day the staff was very courteous - which is a good thing.","Nice place but the food takes a long time to come to the table","2023-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r878511056-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel in Nuwara Eliya. We sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations.

We understand how disappointing it can be when a room does not align with what you anticipated. Your concerns regarding the initial room's condition and noise levels have been duly noted, as we strive to maintain high standards across all our offerings. We also regret that adverse weather conditions affected your ability to enjoy the views you had anticipated, and we appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Regarding our half-board dining option, we take pride in offering one of the best buffet selections compared to other hotels of similar standard. However, we feel that it did not meet your expectations. We are pleased to hear that you found the food quality satisfactory despite this format.

Your observations about service are invaluable to us. While we are grateful that many of our team members provided warm hospitality, it is concerning to learn about inconsistencies in attentiveness from our reception and restaurant staff. Please be assured that we will address these issues internally as part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing guest experiences.

Once again, thank you for sharing these insights, which will assist us in improving both our facilities and services moving forward. Should you choose to visit us again in the future, please feel free to reach out directly so we can ensure an enhanced experience tailored specifically for you.

We knew Nuwara Eliya would be expensive, but were seduced by the online photos of golden ridge & thought it would be worth the splurge we were very wrong! We were already aware that 5* status hotels in Sri Lanka are at a very different standard to those in Europe, Middle East & North America, but we didn't realise the gap would be so great. We booked a junior suite with mountain view, however when shown to the room it bore no resemblance to the photographs. The mountain view, was a slither round a corner if you were to squint through binoculars, just above the restaurant and certainly not the balcony we were expecting. The initial room was very old and tired, we could hear everything from adjacent rooms & corridor,  there was no AC. Family rooms and the quadruples have bigger balconies better views and are cheaper! We subsequently found out all but the mountain suites are in the main hotel. From the response it seems this is a common 'mistake customers make' and it wasn't handled very graciously by the hotel. We upgraded to the mountain suite, taking this from a splurge to simply eye watering. The mountain suite was lovely & the bigger balcony did improve our experience. However having paid for the views the irony was that we had thick mist and rain and couldn't see it for most of the stay. The sun also sets around 6.30pm such that there is no view from the a la carte restaurant & rooftop bars in the evenings, it's all pitch black.

The half board offering is all a self serve buffet, which I wasn't expecting this for such a hefty pricey tag. The food was very good considering it's a buffet, and the best hotel food we had in Sri Lanka, but it's still a buffet. We did look at the other restaurant, but the menu sounded very basic so we stuck with the buffet. 

Service was quite frankly odd at the hotel. The porters, drivers of the golf buggies, cleaners and pool staff were lovely, very warm and friendly, really couldn't do enough for us. Reception staff were just odd, we were literally chased around the hotel for the contactless payment for the upgrade, several times as initially they made a miscalculation. Similarly service in the restaurant was often brusk with plates taken within a split second of finishing food. There was a general sense of the hotel being overstaffed and we wondered if we were interpreting the attempts at attentive service as intrusive. Service certainly wasn't discrete.","A very mixed and ultimately disappointing stay","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r1003640072-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We were in a Mountain View chalet which was AMAZING. Great views, modern interiors, jacuzzi on the balcony, faux fireplace and those tasty homemade biscuits in the rooms. Beautiful updated gym and indoor pool facilities. Unfortunately the heating in our room did not work and we were quite cold at night. No extra blankets in room either. Given that this part of the country is cold it may be something for management to consider. We enjoyed the jacuzzi. Where the property fell short- 1) beautiful buffet restaurant but food was unpalatable. Indian food too salty, pasta sauce bland, mass quantity but poor quality. They seriously need to get a better chef. 2) those going to Horton Plains for hiking will want to leave early but the hotel does not provide golf cart service at that time (the chalets are quite a ways away from main building) and the takeaway breakfast are food items all wrapped in cellophane. When you get to Horton Plains, they make you inwrap every single food item and transfer to paper bags. The hotel should know this and package accordingly. Maybe also consider providing hot tea in the early morning hours, as you do upon arrival (tasty orange spiced tea). It’s very cold and those going hiking leave between 5:30-6:00 am. 3) They would allow us to extend checkout and told us to keep our bags ready but then delayed sending a golf cart to pick up the bags. There was a very helpful gentleman at the front desk- I think his name was Dilmeet- and he deserves recognition!","Beautiful property but food and service are lacking in many areas.","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r988665228-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Be cautious about the room type you book—the new rooms are modern and comfortable, but the old rooms are very dated and in need of serious refurbishment.

Unfortunately, our stay was overshadowed by a fraudulent double charge. This occurred through a message sent by the hotel via Booking.com. While Booking.com reimbursed one of the charges, the hotel denied responsibility and offered no apology, which was deeply disappointing. Resolving the issue required hours of phone calls, and the lack of accountability from the hotel made the experience even worse.

On a positive note, the staff on-site were friendly and helpful during our stay, which we appreciated. However, this wasn’t enough to make up for other shortcomings.

The spa was another disappointment. Located below the pool, it was too noisy to enjoy a relaxing massage. Additionally, the service in the à la carte restaurant was disgraceful, though the food itself was good. For the high, Western-style rates charged, the hotel fails to deliver the level of service and professionalism expected.

In summary, while the newer rooms are appealing and the staff on-site were kind, the overall experience at the Golden Ridge Hotel falls short due to poor guest care, unprofessionalism, and lack of accountability.","Poor Guest Care","2024-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r987962037-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Positives:

Room Size: The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and well-maintained, offering a cozy and relaxing stay.
Reception Staff: The staff at the reception were friendly, welcoming, and professional, ensuring a smooth check-in and check-out process.
Food: The quality and variety of the food were excellent, with delicious options catering to various tastes.
Negatives:

Restaurant Service: Unfortunately, the service in the restaurant was a major letdown. Despite requesting water, the waiter simply placed an empty glass on the table and didn’t bother to fill it. Calling for assistance multiple times was met with no response.
Lack of Proactive Supervision: Supervisors in the restaurant seemed indifferent, standing idly without engaging with guests or seeking feedback.
Summary:
While the rooms, reception staff, and food make for a delightful stay, the poor service in the restaurant significantly tarnished the experience. There is a pressing need for improvement in the restaurant's service standards and staff attentiveness. If these issues are addressed, The Golden Ridge Hotel has the potential to offer an exceptional stay.","Need to improve service in restuarant...","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r987379108-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

2. The carpet outside the bathroom was damp throughout our stay.
3. We found a sharp pin on the carpet!

We were soo looking forward  to the jacuzzi - but the knobs were loose and without markers. We had to call the reception twice and waited 25 min for assistance. 3 gents arrived  and tried to help. We realised  that the jacuzzi was leaking as well.

Minor inconveniences in the room  - the battery for the Safe was not working, the Fridge was locked with no key available, the fake 'fireplace' was always on - a bit tacky, given the french curtains, guide rods would have helped. 

However, the service issues sucked the joy out of the stay  - receipt of laundry at the agreed time took a lot of follow up, room service was atrocious - 90 minutes for a simple order, a few dishes were 'forgotten' and were completely cold, very cold service at the buffet...could go on.

We thank you for choosing The Golden Ridge as your preferred holiday destination. Thank you for bringing your view following your stay.  We are glad you enjoyed the buffet , the service of our staff and the overall ambience of the hotel. 

Regarding your view about the restaurant, I could totally understand your disappointment of not having to dine at your favorite outlet. Yet to clarify the situation,  since the booking was on  meal based, payments are required to made separately for dining in a different restaurant at the property. Please note that your views are highly considered, thus, surprisingly we were unable to trace reliable information on purchasing train tickets and dining in a different outlet . We wish to hear specific details and thus kindly request you to contact our Manager-operations at om@thegoldenridge.com

Thank you for your understanding in this regard. We regret any inconvenience you had to encounter during your stay.

Your feedback is essential in our journey to improve our services; we truly value it.

Thank you having visited Ulpotha and for reviewing your stay. I'm sorry about the creepy crawlies but Ulpotha is very much a place that is all about being wrapped in the arms of nature. Mosquitoes are more of a nuisance but not one that is a constant, as most times of the year are free of them. Having said that, the generous nets under which one sleeps are there to ensure one's nightly comfort. As for having no electricity, that is usually one of the highlights of the experience - the ambience created by naked flames and flares is a special one that quite often creates a visceral connection to our primal roots - one where we spend time talking and rediscovering the comforting oral traditions that connect all humanity.

More than anything, thank you for appreciating what Ulpotha is fundamentally about: the people (both who live there and visit), the food and the yoga. As for one week being enough, as it happens, we usually recommend that guests stay two weeks to truly connect into what is generally a rare and unique experience.

All the best,

Viren Perera

,"7","255384384",,"en","598155",,"Owner","256125288","en","2015-02-24","ulpotha1","Dear londongirl44,
 
Thank you for the kind words about Ulpotha and sorry we didn't meet all your expectations on the yoga and spiritual side of things.
 
It's important in the context of your comments to note that Ulpotha was not created to be a yoga centre to begin with. It was a serendipitous outcome of an exercise in playful creativity with the overriding theme being traditional lifestyle and organic, bio-diverse farming. Yoga came later when we were looking at ways of making Ulpotha financially self-sustaining. It was a good fit because Ulpotha lends itself nicely as a place in which to practice yoga – as well as a place in which to connect with nature and reconnect with one’s self. The latter being important since Yoga is meant as a means of connecting mind and body among other things. By broad consensus, Ulpotha has become a highly rated and welcoming Yoga centre.
 
As for the what's offered, there are times, depending on the teacher, when there might be meditation, more intensive Yoga as well as silent walks. But this depends on the teacher and on the guests present at the time. In the case of the particular (very playful) yoga teacher you had on your holiday, he strongly believes in the idea that understanding one’s ego and then neither denying nor embracing it but accepting it for what it is is central to one’s own self-realisation. His Yoga teaching is based on this and in fact he gave a very good talk on this subject in one of his yoga classes - unfortunately after you left. We are sorry that his message didn't resonate with you.
 
In the end, Ulpotha is a place to come and relax and practice Yoga, rather than being an intensive Yoga centre - though it has much to offer that is spiritual.  Having said that, all of our teachers are highly experienced and able to freely discuss and adapt to the needs of our guests, no matter what their level of practice. It’s not clear in your case whether you voiced a desire for some of the things you mention and were ignored or whether you kept the disappointment of your un-met expectations to yourself. If it’s a case of the former, we unreservedly apologise. 
 
As for the Yoga mats, we do struggle to find ones of high enough quality in the country, though we buy the best available – hence our recommendation to bring one’s own to avoid disappointment with ours. However, it’s a point well taken and we will continue to look for ones of a standard good enough so that we can feel comfortable offering our own to visiting guests.
 
Thanks for coming.

It is true outdoor living which is so peaceful and relaxing. Suzie and the team are very helpful and warm and the food is amazing (even for a non vegan!) 

However as it bills itself as a ""yoga retreat"" I do have some issues.

I would not classify it as a yoga retreat, more a hotel with yoga. It all depends on expectations of course, but to me a yoga retreat should have meditation, spiritual guidance, silent days, discussions....

Ulpotha offers two times a day yoga, but really none of the above. I would think the time here really depends on what teacher is in residence at the time, and is in part my fault for not researching heavily the teachers. I found the one in residence at my time very cold and not spiritual at all...not even one 'om' on a weeks yoga retreat!! There was too much ego for me. 

Also having to bring your own mat is silly...given the prices charged there should be good quality mats available. 

Also there were a lot of children around when I was there - so great for families but perhaps not what I had expected.","Mixed feelings","2015-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r255384384-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review, which was generous in all the things you cited positively about Ulpotha - from how gorgeous you found the place to be to how much you enjoyed the staff, the food, the yoga, the treatments and the other guests.
. 
It's unfortunate that you encountered so many creepy crawlies and had rainy weather during your visit. It is not unusual to encounter a myriad of animal species in Ulpotha, mostly benign, during one's stay - though it's more the case of beautiful birds and butterflies and mischievous monkeys that one usually encounters. However I can understand that nature being as close and immediate as it is in Ulpotha has not been to your taste.  

This is perhaps a good opportunity for us, as management, to reiterate that Ulpotha is not for everyone. However those who are inclined to accept nature at its purest and most open will find  a welcoming spirit - both of a human and animal kind.

I wish you all the best and thank you for having come to Ulpotha and for having taken the time to write about your experience - I'm sorry your visit didn't have an happier outcome.

Kind regards,

Viren Perera",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Near Dambulla & Sigirya In The Heart Of The Cultural Triangle, Ulpotha Village 21100 Sri Lanka","Ulpotha Village","Sri Lanka","21100",,"Near Dambulla & Sigirya","In The Heart Of The Cultural Triangle","598155","7.907367","Ulpotha Village, North Western Province","80.37598","Ulpotha Yoga Retreat And Ayurveda Resort","353","4.9","1","2","4","11","335","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g15192343-d598155-Reviews-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html","http://www.ulpotha.com/","2012-09-26","OTHER","3",,"Value","3","Rooms","1","Location","3","Cleanliness","5","Service","4","Sleep Quality","2","I was ready to stay ages, I was in an adventurous spirit but reality struck me and made me change my mind.
Tha place is gorgeous and the staff very friendly, the vegan organic food is incredible and the other guests are very interesting people. However it was hard to stay in these huts with no walls, the bathrooms were not too close so a night pee was out of the question. The humidity made everything always wet.
The animals are another problem, we had a large mouse (who we named Ludwig) crawling on the beams above our beds. I had to keep shaking my clothes every time I wanted to put a t shirt on for fear that bugs or mice had crawled into my suitcase.
What really made me leave was a hanging snake on the hut's low roof, that almost touched me upon entering my place. 
Other than that, the yoga is great and so are the other treatments and massages they offer.","Had to cut my trip short","2012-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r141385067-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

A five star resort it is not.
Fantastic food. Great Ayurvedic treatments.
Great wildlife around...too much for some. Beautiful butterflies, dragon flies. Some fantastic views to take in.
You get a lot out of removing yourself from a city existence and experiencing this more back to basics lifestyle. It feels like you are getting a very authentic sense of the place.
Do bear in mind the Mosquitos will get you, take insect repellant, allergy tablets and bite cream! Also a torch!","Be Prepared and you'll enjoy it","2011-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r104698261-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",
