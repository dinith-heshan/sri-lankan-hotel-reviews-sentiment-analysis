Thank you for your feedback. We regret any inconveniences you encountered during your stay, particularly with the accommodation and unfavourable weather.

The accommodation was in a wooden hut overlooking the paddy fields. The weather in the evening was not kind to us, we had torrential rain which meant it was too wet to walk over to the bar as there were no facilities close by. They do provide bikes but these were no good in heavy rain. The netting around the bed (which was to protect us against mosquitoes) had dead flies stuck in it and a large hole which meant we were batting off insects during the night. We did move rooms the next day but a hole in the netting gave us the same problem with the insects. Breakfast was lovely with friendly staff. 

I don’t think we would return as it was too far from Ella and we missed our creature comforts.

The service is excellent and the concept of staying within the nature, among 40 acres of paddy fields, is great. We spent over 1 hour walking around the nature. Unfortunately, the price is steep (over 200 USD per night) and the hotel positions itself as a 5-star luxury resort, but it is far from the quality level you would expect from such price point.

The hotel brands itself as sustainable and eco-friendly and that seems to be a recurring theme to justify all sorts of cost savings and quality downgrades to guests. Some things like the absence of AC or re-use of slippers/shampoo bottles make sense, as it  saves a lot of energy/resources, but there are many other things where it just felt the hotel was trying to be cheap: rooms are not super clean, very low light, no sound isolation, not much hot water, dozens of bugs and spiders in the room because the houses are not well built, staff often getting a bit confused (though everyone is super nice and helpful) due to insufficient training.

Also note that the driver accommodation has over 15 people per room. So for a hotel that prides itself on providing good conditions for locals, I find that a bit disturbing. I'm not sure what the conditions for staff are, but I assume they are not much better.

We don't regret staying in the hotel as it was an interesting experience, but just don't come expecting true luxury","Good experience but not true luxury","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r932463179-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

The Sri Lankans should start to treat their former colonial masters as the rest of Europe does with them. Just kick them out. 

Or at least teach them how to behave! So that civilized continental (and other Brit) Europeans can feel comfortable in this beautiful five star resort.

To say it with my final words: I’m disappointed about the attitude of management towards regular customers. That would not happen in a European 5* hotel!

We appreciate your feedback and for bringing certain aspects of your stay up to our attention. Kaduruketha is located amidst paddy land, coconut and others plantations and therefore the presence of insects, reptiles, birds and inhabit the same area. We do our level best to eliminate the insect problem by conducting fumigation, and keeping our garden and surroundings clean.

As a survivor of a mosquito-borne illness, I don’t get giddy or exoticizing over paddy fields in my backyard. Looks great but it’s a mosquito breeding ground! Got stung so many times despite having used insect repellent balm.

Another point to fault is dining area that is often out of sight of the waiter. This is primarily a design problem. Dining area is in roofed open area while the waiters were mostly in the walled off bar area. Every time, I had to walk over to call the waiter just to make an order.

Now the room. The mosquito netting over the bed has big holes which defeats its purpose. The mesh of the door to the open bathroom also has big holes, thus offering little barrier to the mosquitoes for a feasty visit!

So despite the stunning view and aesthetic designs, and friendly staff, I’d have to advise anyone against staying at this place.

On our first night, we were greeted by torrential rain but we were warmly received and taken to our lodge. I have never seen a room as bad (106). It was not clean, the netting around the beds were completely torn and as a result of the rain, many insects had someone managed to get into the lodge. Moreover, the bathroom was outdoors and infested with ants, slugs, mosquitos and god knows what else. I called the management immediately to ask for the bed to be cleaned and for a new net to be put up. Unfortunately, I had to call a second time as none of the staff came to inspect the room. Eventually, two men came to look at the problem and understood my concerns. They said they did not have another net or any other rooms so we would have to just put the lights out and get some sleep. Not ideal! The next morning, whilst we were searching for another hotel as I had no intention of going through another night of being eaten alive, one of the staff approached to inform me that they were changing our room and had the decency the apologise for the previous night. This was very much appreciated and we decided to give the hotel another chance and stay for a second night. Again, it rained heavily on our second night, but the lodge was much better with netting that actually worked and an indoor bathroom. 

Other points, the views of the paddy fields are fantastic and the service is generally quite good. The staff are friendly and helpful. The food is mixed. I thought the breakfast was poor but the dinner was quite good, especially the Sri Lankan dishes.","Managed to redeem the worst hotel experience in my life...","2017-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r548167085-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time share your experience on TripAdvisor.

It is wonderful to note that you enjoyed the local cuisine and the ambiance of the property. However, we have also noted the inconveniences caused during your stay with us.

The reasoning behind the fact that we do not have air conditioned dwellings is because we wish to create a village like experience for our guests, and due to the cross breeze from the mountains maintain a cool environment. Although, during the dry season it can get quite warm, but still breezy and cool in the nights.

We have taken note of all your comments and we assure you we are looking into these matters to the best of our ability.

We really enjoyed the dip in the pool overlooking the paddy fields.

The rooms are spread out chalets and very average. The biggest issue was that the rooms were not air-conditioned! The only airconditioned area in the hotel was the library which could seat 4 persons and is your rescue on a hot day. Also there were bugs in the rooms. The bathroom has a 3/4 wall from the room and made us a bit uncomfortable as we were sharing a room 

The front desk needs to have better coordination with the head office and be updated on the booked rates of the guests. We were charged almost 30% more and had to show the confirmation from head office and get the bill corrected. Also it maybe worthwhile checking online (such as booking.com) for better rates

Thank you for reviewing Jetwing Kaduruketha on TripAdvisor.

First and foremost, on behalf of the entire team at Jetwing Kaduruketha, I would like to extend our sincere apologies to you and your family with regards to the property not meeting your expectations. However, the location of the hotel is surrounded by nature and the chances of encountering insects and lizards is very likely. We do provide our Guests with mosquito nets and repellent in each room so as to minimize this issue. If this had not been communicated to you, we are extremely sorry, we will look into it and rectify the issue as soon as possible.

With regards to the food not being up to par, we assure you that we do our best to deliver a product with the highest standard and quality. However, we apologize for not being able to do so this time. 

It is true, we do not provide driver accommodation, but will always be happy to assist you in finding one close by. The signage that guides Guests to our property stands erect in several places and we are sorry that you missed it. We take Guest feedback very seriously as it will help us improve where necessary. Therefore we thank you for your feedback.

Rooms are well furnished and spacious.
A few things let to hotel down, like the dogeared state of the menus - it's no great advertisment for the meal you are about to order if the menu card has long since seen better days.
One or two areas seem to be left half finished particularly around the (otherwise excelent) pool.

This hotel looks fancy and the rooms look very tasteful in photos. So we were a bit taken aback when we saw how worn the room was. The colours are still nice – just very worn. Some of the furnishings were simply too worn to be acceptable. The minibar/fridge literally fell apart when we opened it. We pointed this out and got a replacement fridge the next day which was also worn, albeit a little bit better. The bathroom door locked itself from the inside because it touched against the shower wall so we had to keep the bathroom door open to stop it from happening.

The room itself was spacious and the balcony super. We were very lucky with the location of the room – on the second floor and directly overlooking the pool and sea. So this was a very big plus.

The staff were all very friendly – another big plus.

The location in Unawatuna is a bit removed from the worst hustle and bustle and thus a bit quieter. The hotel put on loud outdoor music one of the evenings and we felt like complaining as we wanted to go to bed around 10 PM (for an early start the next morning), but they did stop the music at 10:30 – I suppose that's OK for most people but not everyone likes the loud boom-boom but prefers peace and quiet.

On the whole, we had an OK experience – we enjoyed the balcony and the views and the friendly staff. But the room and furnishings were unfortunately too worn for more than a 3-star rating.","Great views but very worn","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r940092756-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Probably better  to save some cash and downgrade, or pay more.. because what you get here is 5 star prices with a 4 star hotel. Nice view (from some rooms). 

The positives: Food was good. Chef came out to explain how he cooled things. Generally quick service. Small selection but high quality breakfast buffet. Excellent view from pool to private rocks (that photo you see on their website).

The negative: Prices are about 30%+ relative to other equivalent places. Pool has no shade and by 1030 is near unbearable -  Only 3 poolside seats have umbrellas, so you can sit inside restaurant or bake. The room we booked had views of solar panels, so we downgraded from the suite / family room to a king size with a view - no reimbursement of price difference because according to them ""they were being flexible"". Bathrooms not great standard. Guests at 5am getting home from beach parties playing loud music (two out of two nights). Twice placed food order and ha things not delivered. Gym is small, but also was busy.

Other things: At sign in, ""we have a tuk tuk to our private beach"", later ""sorry no tuk tuk is available but you can walk"". At sign in, ""just ask at reception for pool towels"", later ""sorry we only have 1 towel left, can you use your room towel?"".  Free WiFi, ""connected, no internet available"".

Dear Valued Guest,

Thank you for your comments. We are happy that you found the décor, rooms and pools “brilliant” – a point noted by many visitors. Our concept of blending in with nature and allowing the visitor to enjoy the glory of the Sri Lankan Southern shores have struck a chord with many of our guests who return year after year. 

In our zest to accommodate our guests, we are sometimes compelled to allow them to use the pools after or before hours as they are highly enjoyable – with a choice of salt water and fresh water to plunge in. however we request all guests to be considerate and abide by the pool times mentioned clearly as 8a.m. – 7p.m. 

It is unfortunate that you had to endure irritations as those you mentioned, but if you had brought these to the notice of the hotel manager, we could have minimized them by taking some action to ensure your comfort and peace. 

We extend our courtesy to serve you once more and provide a better experience on your return. 

Wishing you good health!
Manager Thaproban

The Hotel itself in terms of decor is brilliant, the rooms are great and the pools are brilliant. However... we had a poolside room and although the pool opening times state 8am - 8pm there were guests in the pool from 7am on one occasion and until 11pm in the evening which made it very noisy in our room. When i asked a member off staff about the times he just said you can use the pool any hour of the day. 
The restaurant also plays quite annoying 'pipe style' music from about 7am which is really noisy for the rooms next to the pool. 
My last point is that the staff are constantly trying to sell you the Spa services and to force you to eat in the restaurant that evening... The food in the restaurant is average and way more expensive than that of the brilliant restaurants nearby (Sea waves for example). 
All in all, it was an expensive stay and left us feeling like we were ready to leave.","We felt let down...","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r741736534-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Dinner was a set four course menu of which I would say 30% of the food was below average (for example, a creme brulee that consistent of a very basic custard with completely un-bruleed sugar on top - it was probably the worst dessert I have ever had). The barbecue dinner was much better. The room we stayed in was mediocre. Bathroom was dated with very few amenities ( 1 small bar of soap, refilled bottles of body wash, shampoo and conditioner, 1 loofah and a small bottle of body lotion. Also, no hotel slippers, only very large flip flops to be worn at the hotel only. The towels did not always smell fresh (like they had not dried properly) although they were replaced daily and they were very average. At a hotel, especially a ""fancy"" hotel I expect high quality towels and preferably white knowing that they have probably been bleached before use. The towels were beige and grey and very small, and the only other set were very very small hand towels so I had to dry my hair with my wet body towel. The bedding was a bit thick and heavy for the climate - a unfitted sheet option would have made it more comfortable. My pillow also had multiples stains on it (both mold and saliva stains) which I addressed with staff and they provided me slightly less stained pillows. The spare set of pillows were in a musky cupboard and had pillow cases that were slightly too small for the pillows exposing stains on them too and were unacceptable to use. The balcony was spacious and the salt water pool was really nice. I, however, left feeling slightly disappointing with this being the final leg of our journey and higher expectations relative to the cost, I do not see myself returning soon to this hotel.","Did not live up to expectations","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r659813732-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much for sharing your sincere thoughts and constructive critic which is considered with utmost respect.
Your encouraging feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every day.
 
However please accept our sincere apology for not meeting your expectations on uninterrupted supply of bath and pool towels due to unpropitious operational issues that we had to deal with.
However pleased to inform that they are all being resolved.
 
We have started language classes for all associates required improvements in their literacy levels in order to maintain superior levels of guest relations.
 
Please accept our sincere apology for your inconvenience occurred during conversation (towels) for not conveying the message as hospitable as it would be, even by mistake or due to low literacy.
 
We do regular pest control to assure pest free environment and surprisingly no such reports/complaints by any guest during your stay with us (we would immediately attend if such). However there is a tendency for insects to enter the rooms if doors/windows kept opened.
 
Regular training takes place on further improvements. Our heartiest gratitude for sharing such encouraging comments and really looking forward in welcoming you back at Thaproban Pavilion Waves.
 
 
Thank you.

We regret the challenges you faced during your stay and want to assure you that your concerns are taken seriously.
While we’re glad you found the junior suite spacious and the beds comfortable, we acknowledge that certain elements, such as the room's character and the issues with the AC and power sockets, did not reflect the standard we strive to maintain. We are, however, pleased that our team promptly addressed the situation, although we deeply regret the inconvenience caused by the power outage and the delay in our generator response. This has been brought to our attention for immediate review and improvement.
Additionally, your feedback about the bathroom towels, the condition of the pathway, and the sunbeds has been noted. We recognize the importance of maintaining these details to enhance our guests’ experience, and we will be taking corrective actions to ensure that these areas receive the attention they need. Your comments will guide us as we work to improve both the physical upkeep and overall ambiance of the hotel.
On a brighter note, it’s fantastic to hear that you enjoyed the food served at our restaurant, particularly the à la carte options for lunch and dinner. We are glad that this aspect of your stay stood out as one of the highlights, and we hope the dining experience left you with positive memories of your visit.

In contrast to every other hotel we visited in Sri Lanka (we had stayed in 6 prior to this hotel) the management at this hotel was absent! The junior suite was very spacious and the beds were comfortable but like the hotel, the room lacked any type of character. The AC unit in the room was it working when we arrived and neither were several of the power sockets.  Once reported, the management promptly sent out an engineer who managed to fix everything. The AC went off again the next night due to a powercut but the back up generator did not kick in for several hours as we were woken up at 5am by the heat! 
The bathroom was rather dated and the towels were not white and fluffy but an off white colour and fraying at the edges (and one had holes).  The pathway to the rooms were also in need of repair with cracked tiles in  several places. 
The pool is a good size but the sunbeds are old and quite rickety.   
Breakfast was ok and buffet style with a mixture of both Sri Lankan and western options. Lunch and dinner however were al la carte and they were both very good, serving some of the best food we had during our stay in Sri Lanka.

We truly regret that your experience did not meet your expectations and would like to address the concerns you raised.
Regarding the room you were assigned, we sincerely apologize for the confusion about the bed size and room type. At the time of your booking, we aimed to enhance your comfort by upgrading you to a mini suite, which is adjacent to the executive suite. However, we fully understand that the queen-sized bed was not suitable for your husband's height, and we are sorry this caused discomfort during your stay. Your feedback will help us ensure clearer communication and room assignments in the future.
We also deeply regret the technical issues you experienced with the room's controls and air conditioning. While our team attended to the problem promptly, we understand that the issue persisted, which is certainly not the experience we wish to provide. We will be thoroughly reviewing the room's systems to prevent similar issues moving forward.
With respect to the breakfast, we sincerely apologize that the selection did not meet your expectations. We strive to offer a variety that suits all tastes, but clearly, we fell short during your visit. Your valuable comments have been shared with our culinary team, and we are already looking into ways to improve the presentation of our breakfast items.
We also understand your disappointment regarding the availability of pool loungers. During high occupancy periods, we recognize that this can be an issue, and we are working to find ways to better accommodate all our guests during these busy times.
As for the location, while we are not directly on the beach, we are glad to hear that you enjoyed your visit to Uppuveli Beach, which is just a short walk from the hotel. We aim to offer a peaceful environment while still allowing access to the beautiful beach nearby.
Once again, we truly appreciate your feedback as it helps us continuously improve. We hope you will consider staying with us again so that we may have the opportunity to provide you with a more enjoyable and seamless experience.

On arrival the hotel looks OK and the prices would suggest it is of 4 star standard however this is actually not the case. We paid US$158 per night for what we thought was a mini suite room however turned out to be the adjacent room to the executive suite. We were under the impression that the room contained a king size bed however it was a queen and my husband who is 6’1” was too long and his legs hung over the end.

Nothing in the room worked properly. The power pads control numerous lights, fans, etc however some didn’t work and others controlled things they shouldn’t. For example, when you turned off the light above the mirror it also turned off the fan and AC. The second AC unit turned itself off at night and so the bedroom was unbearably hot at night necessitating the fan being switched to high. We advised reception and to their credit they contacted maintenance who came to fix it however it stopped again.

We purchased B&B and breakfast was quite the experience. The poached eggs were precooked and sitting in a Bain Marie which meant they were hard and rubbery. There was carrots vichy, garlic spinach and cooked zucchini together with a multitude of sweets aimed at the children.

The pool area is quite nice however there are insufficient loungers for the number of guests.

The hotel is not on a beach and is about a 10 minute walk from Upavilla Beach. The beach is lovely.

Staff friendly but need some serious hospitality/waiter training as mealtimes where very haphazard and disorganised. Lots of little annoying things that showed they really didn’t know what they were doing. We also had a safety worry as throughout our stay the pool lights were hanging from wires out of the pool while staff were working on them!
It appeared that the staff had very mixed roles but nobody seemed to take ownership of specific roles. This could well be down to the owner/manager who walked about but not interested in engaging with his clients.

The food in the restaurant (buffet) was good.  The breakfast was not very good.  We had to search for a long time to find something that appealed to us. 
 
What bothered us the most was the service in the restaurant and bar area.

They are trying to get it right but there are things that need attending to. If I could do a 3.5 rating that's where this rating would be.
What's good.......the staff are super friendly and will go out of their to help you with anything. This included front office, housekeeping, bar and restaurant. Management need to support them in their enthusiasm and channel it accordingly. They really do want the hotel to be successful and it will get better as the destination becomes more frequently visited.
What's not so good.....slippery surfaces. We upgraded to a suite for a reasonable price which allowed us a large room fully renovated downstairs with direct garden and pool access which was lovely. The decor was good, clean and modern but the tiles in the bathroom were deadly when wet and by deadly I mean deadly. We ended up using towels on the shower floor while showering to make sure we didn't lose our footing or slip and fall. Even wearing thongs didn't help.
The other slippery surface was that around the pool coping tile.....again the tiles looked great but once you step on that wet surface they are slippery and could be dangerous.
I did speak to the staff about this and sincerely hope management have taken notice and applied non-slip material to avoid any what could be nasty accidents.
The restaurant has a nice aspect but with the constant opening and closing of doors the flying insects just loved to make their way to the buffet breakfast bar. No more to be said about that. The breakfast buffet was ok but there could be some improvement.

I’m sorry that you had a less than perfect experience while staying with uss, but it’s unfortunate that you’ve chosen such a title for your review.  It seems like you're attempting to discredit our hotel by targetting all the good effort and time that our past guests have invested when writing their own personal reviews for TripAdvisor.  Claiming that their posted  photos and reviews are deceptive is surely not a productive and fair way to engage in a critique of our establishment. I would have much preferred if you had addressed the conversation between you and my team without blaming our guests for an experience regarding a perception you felt was untrue.  I’m very happy though you round our rooms satisfyingly spacious however, and our sri lankan cuisine good.  But am unhappy that we disappointed you and your group in regards to service delays and a burnt steak.  Pleased however to hear they were able to cook it properly to your satisfaction upon indication, and I’ve actually reviewed our menu regarding this item upon our menu. We always look to improve :)  Regarding charging for the beach, my manager states that we don’t charge and never have charged for boating our guests down to the neighboring beach, and any charges would be to rent their umbrellas.  The aqua-taxi is a service we provide free of charge to guests wanting a day at the surf.  It’s free, and so is the five minute walk to it from our own hotel :)  I want to apologize once again for your experience, but I’m reviewing everything that you’ve stated was a sore point and am looking to make changes that will improve our guest experience.  I’m hoping that you’ll one day come visit us again and see if we can show you what so many other guests have seen in Amaranthe Bay as a small and exclusive getaway upon our little lagoon.

I’m glad you got to visit us, had a friendly time with our staff, finding them helpful and kind :)  Also really glad you liked the pool, as it’s one of my favorite places to be at the hotel.  Center stage, lagoon-facing, and sprawled out in front of the suites so that everyone can feel they’re seeing and being a part of  the action.  I’m really sorry however that you did not find your time with us as satisfying as if there had been a beach.  When we built Amaranthe Bay, we actually had to choose between the type of character or ambiance we wanted to create for our guests.  We knew that if we went beach, it would impact our vision of a secluded, private, tucked away retreat. So we instead opted for going lagoon.  After making this choice, we then instituted a free Aqua Taxi service which floats guests down the lagoon to the beach with their belongings, or they just mosey on down the path to the beach. It’s only five minute away :)  I also read your feedback on the rooms you selected, and I’m sorry if you didn’t get the ones you had wanted.  We only offer two basic types of rooms here on site, the Standard Twin and the Junior Suites.  If you look at Agoda, Trip Advisor,  or even our own web site, you can see from the photos a very clear difference in characteristics such as floors and furniture that distinguish one from another. The Standard rooms though are thankfully easier on the budget with no luxury amenities, but do come well equipped with air conditioning, bar fridge, a safe and other amenities. They of course don't share the luxury (and highly talked about) features of the Junior Suites which feature indoor jacuzzi, balcony views, high ceilings and teak floors. I can understand how disappointing it must have felt to be thinking of one thing and getting another, but I hope your experience with us this time doesn't discourage you from visiting us again.  If you’re looking for a place to zen out, do some kayaking, watch eagles swoop about, or just sit back and sip icy cocktails with me and the team, we’d love to have you over again!

The hotel is known for its large and well decorated rooms. Unfortunately that was not our experience. We booked via Agoda and it's pretty clear that the hotel has certain rooms for travelers that book via travel sites and not directly with the property.  One of the desk people confirmed as much when I asked him point blank.  Kind of disappointing there as well. I would recommend putting realistic photos on those travel site listings so guests aren't misled. 

The staff was very helpful and all incredibly kind.  They're all locals and the hotel was built by aid donated after the tsunami struck in 2004, so that was a nice feature of the place. 

All in all, I think the hotel is OK.  The pool is nice, but the lack of a beach or close beach access was kind of a bummer for us.   It's also just kind of boring to be honest - not much going on or interaction with other guests. There is a pool bar, but nobody really inhabited it.  We ended up spending two nights and going back to Trinco Blu for more energy and the beach vibe.

We have recently changed to a diligent “food cooked to order” policy, which ensures the freshest of rice and curry with the highest standard of ingredients cooked for every customer on every order.  If you read the reviews before and after yours you can see that we’ve had immense success with our new program and guests have found the foods sensational.  Was it the temperature of something you ate that we could have prepared better, or creation of a food item that you had wanted prepared another way?  I encourage all our guests to immediately signal to our Chef or any member of the team while eating so that we can address any concerns or comments you may have.  We want to be your favorite five star in all of Sri Lanka, and with your feedback we can create the culinary adventures you are looking for! I want to thank you for taking the time to write us, I’m very much hoping to see you this summer.

Yes, the Standard rooms’ offerings are indeed different from the Junior Suites, but we created them so that guests looking for a different price point while staying at our resort would find a reasonable accommodation.

The hotel’s design, facilities, and amenities are incredibly luxurious and modern, but the staff tends to be more formal than friendly.
A very serious issue at the hotel is the presence of mosquitoes and other insects, both in public areas and in the rooms. Although the hotel provides a modern device to repel mosquitoes inside the room but the lobby, a large part of the main restaurant, and the pool area are full of them. I found it surprising that despite the hotel's generosity in providing high-quality amenities for guests, they don’t offer a simple or inexpensive insect repellent spray, nor do they sell it in their on-site shops. Unfortunately, even the staff could not properly guide me on where to purchase one. (However, I must express my deep gratitude to Mr. Suranda, who was very kind and lent us his personal spray on the first night so we could use it for our four-year-old daughter.)
In general, don't put too much trust in the promises made at the hotel. For example, they took my WhatsApp contact to coordinate water sports activities, but as of writing this review, my message hasn’t even been seen! They also promised to email me the final bill, but that never happened. And there were several other similar cases...
We didn’t try the Asian or Italian restaurants (which have additional charges), but the main restaurant (we had half-board service) wasn’t particularly enjoyable. We almost always had to search for an empty indoor table (to avoid mosquitoes and the high humidity). The variety and quality of local food were acceptable, but the drink service—water, tea, and coffee—was terrible. Despite multiple reminders to different staff members, drinks were either not served, served very late, or not refilled.
The hotel's oceanfront beach is good, but not as stunning as the beaches in Bentota. The hotel has two main pools—one of which does not allow children (?). The other pool is excellent, with great temperature and views, but even there, the service wasn’t up to five-star standards. I had to fetch towels myself from the designated area.
Unfortunately, I noticed some behaviors that made me feel like certain nationalities received better service than others. I sincerely hope my impression was wrong.
The kids’ club, however, was amazing—professional, well-organized, and run by kind and talented staff. A special thanks to all three staff members there!
Despite all my criticisms, the staff kindly allowed us a late check-out for six hours for $50. However, on our last morning, they moved us to another room that didn’t even have towels, and we ended up spending time chasing a lizard out of the new room!
The hotel offers currency exchange services too, but they provide very low rates and only accept extremely new bills—any small stain or stamp on the note means they won’t take it. 
Their transfer services are also priced at three to five times the cost of Uber or local taxis (though this is common in most luxury hotels).
Overall, my stay wasn’t bad, but it was far from what I had imagined...","Not bad","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1000088633-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Luxurious, spectacular views, some of the best food ever with lovely, if untrained staff who lacked proper management (we have been told salaries of staff in Sri Lankan hotels are low).
We had a 3 night stay at the end of a busy and excellent group tour of Sri Lanka.
A day and a half of rest, we thought!

Baggage handling, as it had been throughout Sri Lanka was superb. Our room comfortable and spotless but lacking towels etc. one pair  of flip floor had been worn and some of the toiletries opened. It took 3 visits to resolve.
Our ground floor verandah overlooked pleasant enough greenery.

We ate in the Italian restaurant, one of the best Italian meals we have ever had.
Our first breakfast surpassed our expectations. We spoke to a restaurant manager to praise the eggs chef. We were introduced to him.

We decided to book the Italian Restaurant again for our final holiday meal. We were told they had a Valentines Day tasting menu at (I think)99$pp. We declined and booked the Spice Restaurant; again superb food.
Some of our fellow tour friends had booked the Italian but had not been told the change of menu. They cancelled their booking.

On our only full day of relaxation we went to the idyllic beach cove where we happily ensconced ourselves until!!!
The Hotel had decided to have a special St Valentines Day dine on the beach at, 200$ pp? (The figures may be wrong). By midday staff were erecting dining areas effecting the views which the hotel is famous  for.
We retired to the adults only swimming pool to find a similar situation ‘dine at the pool and at a similar cost?). People moving chairs and tables in front of us. We returned to our veranda for a restful afternoon but had been denied the facilities we had paid substantially for.

I am sure the evening meal experiences would have been superb but at that price they had to be.

I wonder how many of the hotel residents could be catered for and, indeed how many paid to attend these events. None of our group did.

What was the justification to ruin the pleasure and facilities of the majority to enable the hotel to further increase its revenue stream in addition to the substantial charges it makes for residency.

In describing our glorious holiday we emphasise the general Sri Lankan hotel excellence. Sadly for this hotel it is their disregard for its paying clients that we remember first, despite the food quality etc.

Everyone was tired and wanted to get to their rooms and then have dinner. The check in process was protracted and when I arrived for dinner the restaurant were unaware of our group and had to reconfigure the room to accommodate us, displacing guests already dining! I as advised to collect my food from the buffet. However, when I retuned to the table I had no cutlery and nobody was interested in my requirements. IN the end the manger came over and asked it I was OK, I asked again for cutlery and a drink, which he then proceeded to get. So not a good start. The food though was delicious and plentiful.
The room was amazing and the outlook great. Some noise from the nearby railway woke me early next day, but no complaints on accommodation.
The hotel is poorly deigned. No idea what the architect was on but space planning was not one of their strengths. There is no direct route form the reception to the ground floor rooms, requiring the sue of stairs or lift to the first floor to cross over the admin area before going down to the ground floor again. Not good for the elderly or infirm. The alternative was a long walk going through the bar and restaurant. Signage was not good and many in our party struggled to navigate the hotel. The adult pool was not easy to find and when I did I thought it very strange. It felt like it was 3ft wide and 2 miles long! Not conducive to swimming really. There were few sun loungers there for the size of hotel, though the adjacent beach provide plenty.
Another delicious meal followed to end our tour, but this was spoilt by a protracted settling of accounts as they had managed to put the wrong bar bills on the room accounts. It was far more time consuming and complicated than necessary, taking nearly half and hour. I had to calculate what i owed them as their system did not allow. They were more interested in the system issues than ensuring the customer was satisfied and paid the correct amount. There were a number of us who had issues with the accounts. Again I had to renew my acquaintance with the manager!
The hotel should have had a higher score, but the layout and administrative issues tainted my stay.","Nice hotel but be patient!","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r995382772-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Special shout out to Shalindra and Lashan, the headchef of Olu, the maitre d of Olu (thanks for the seafood platter) and ‘my brother from another mother’ at the pool. 
- they recognize loyalty (we got upgraded to a seaview suite) and threw in a bottle of wine as well plus a welcome fruit bowl
- the gardens are beautiful and the gym is well equipped. 
Negatives
- the main pool is small and in high season there will not be enough sunloungers. Plus it is so shallow that the temperature equals that of the air. The view is of a river/lagoon but not the beach. 
- the rooms are a bit dated and in need of refurbishment. Our suite’s A/C did not work properly (despite engineering working on it for 6 hours) and the roll down curtains do not fully block out all the light. Cupboards and the bed make creaking noises. But because of the ac issue we did get complimentary massages and dinner at Olu. 
- the adult pool is tiny and has no view to speak off (seaview is blocked by trees) and cannot accommodate more than 20 people comfortably
- the breakfast choices are fine. Some western options (eggs, yoghurt, asian fruit) but it is mainly Asian
- dinner options are poor as Aqualina (the Italian restaurant at the adult pool) and Spice traders (the Asian restaurant) were closed most days leaving only Olu as an option. The a la carte choice at Olu is fine and they will cook pasta carbonara even if it is not on the menu (thanks guys!) but the quality could be better. And the buffet at $51 is overpriced and not international (few western options)
- the location is remote. There are no restaurants worthy of a visit near the hotel and there is a road splitting the hotel in 2 which is public. That means locals can address you whenever you walk between your room and all other facilities of the hotel. 
- the hotel allows locals, if they have made reservations for the seafood lunch (once a week), to use the pool facilities. A negative surprise.","Staff 10 out 10, Facilities/Location 5 out of 10","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r963444173-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Some areas for improvement: 
1) Before arriving you get several surveys asking for preferences check in times etc (you get the sent the same email several times even after filling it out which was frustrating and eventually had to send to spam). In spite of this I still got a call during my work day asking me the same information that i had just filled out in the survey including check in time. I would suggest choosing either or, if you are going to send a survey, don't also call, also sending the survey just once is sufficient. It was both overwhelming and time consuming. 
2) Was traveling with a toddler which is a challenge, one evening I had just managed to put him to bed, and then the front desk called at 8 pm with a 'courtesy call' the phone was incredibly loud and it woke up my child after I had just managed to put him to bed, starting the whole cycle of trying to get him to sleep all over again which took another 2 hours. It was a terrible night, I would suggest that staff not call the room after 6 pm, particularly if they know there is a child in the room. 
3) Accessibility, I was using a pram and there is no way to get to the restaurant or pool coming from the boardwalk without going up stairs. I am heavily pregnant so trying to get my toddler, and pram up the stairs with no help proved a challenge throughout the stay. I would suggest having a ramp to the pool area and restaurant for wheelchair users and pram users. 
4) The restaurant staff seemed really inexperienced and it was challenging with a toddler. It was off season so there were just a couple of other people staying at the hotel, in spite of this, it felt like every time we went to the restaurant it was like we were coming in for the first time. The staff seemed surprised we needed a high chair each time (and it always took ages to come) and in the end we would just grab one from the outside area where we knew they were kept which would fluster the staff, but when trying to wrangle a toddler, time is of the essence. They also always seem surprised that we wanted water and had to explain each time that we didn't want bottled water, just normal filtered water which always came really late and was surprisingly difficult to communicate. 
In the end we left early because we didn't feel relaxed.","Beautiful hotel but not five star","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r954445085-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Not so great 
Hotel is very isolated  and not great for a solo person
 It's huge and we were spread across a massive hotel with dark, badly lit and floored walk ways back to rooms.
Service was average.... staff trying to please, however often lack of understanding  and took at least 10 mins every day at breakfast to get a coffee. 
Not normally an issue but on tour , with early coach pick ups , it was fustrating.

Food was average but expensive.  
A coke was 1350  rupees     270 in supermarket  and about 800 in a better 5 star hotel in Colombo. 
You are kind of stuck in this hotel

Thank you for taking the time to post a review and bringing to our attention the many difficulties you faced during your stay. We regret not being able to meet your expectations in terms of the design of our hotel and less crowd during low occupancy period.  This was highly affected in most of hotels in Srilanka fortunately now we are blessed with decent occupancy all the time.

We Delighted to hear that you enjoyed the suite room and all our rooms and landscape have designed by the great architecture Geoffrey Bawa, the father of Tropical Modernist architecture, 
We are of most concerned to learn of your dissatisfaction on breakfast layout and overpriced dining experience at the property.  We would like to extend our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience during your stay.

We will examine the situation to minimise any glitches in our services and rest assured review the matter with the management as soon as possible. 

We do hope that you will not allow this visit to our hotel to be your last. We are eager to serve you and we find no other cause more fulfilling than being your host.

We all look forward to welcoming you back to Anantara Kalutara Resort for another great experience.

Thank you for taking the time to write us your feedback.

 However, we sincerely apologise for the average services you experienced during your stay, which fell well below your expectations.

At this stage, I would like to apologise for the inconvenience, and I am very confident that we can do better. It is our constant endeavor to improve on our standards and services and to ensure that guests like you are comfortable. Thank you for sharing your opinion with us.We are disappointed that you were not pleased with the food of the resort.
We will, of course, take in your honest feedback to see how we can further improve our services.

Thank you very much for taking time to post a review of our hotel and for your positive feedback on our location, ambiance, and our product.

Pertaining to your comments on being priced high, our products and services are all competitively priced keeping in mind other five star hotels in the city. We always focus on aspects like creating beautiful memories and customer delight. However, we will keep your feedback on record when we next review our pricing structure.

Thank you for sharing your opinion on TripAdvisor.

It was a surprise to read your comments, as we have a program in place with local entities to deal with abandoned dogs. This project is very important to us, and we care for the welfare of the animals.

Our security director has already taken note of this occurrence and will take the necessary steps on the case reported by you.

Regarding the cleanliness of the hotel's surrounding areas, I believe you have seen our gardening team very committed to this task. Anyway, we have already strengthened the staff, and we will do our best to make even the areas outside of our property ware better-taken care of.

We regret that we were unable to meet your expectations, and we hope to have another opportunity to welcome you to Anantara Kalutara.

Reinforcing our apologies, should you return to Sri Lanka, please don't hesitate to contact me and allow us to offer you a better experience.

The pictures on the gallery looked great, and we were supposedly getting a ‘deal’ on a credit card offer. I was a bit apprehensive as it was only on BB terms with no options to upgrade to even HB. Nevertheless, we booked for 2 nights.

We were warmly welcomed, and the property is truly beautiful, with the pool overlooking the lagoon. As were the rooms, which were extremely comfortable. However, I nearly fell off my chair looking at the in-room dining menu. The prices were simply ridiculous. One example being; rice and curry (the meal that cuts across all economic classes in this country) was priced at SLR 4K, and even more depending on what meat you chose. We then inquired as to how much the dinner buffet was - it worked out to SLR8K+ PER HEAD. And let me tell you it was no gala spread!

It seems as if the Anantara group is intent on single handedly saving the Sri Lankan economy. In this case, much to my detriment, with having a family of 5 to see to.

It’s a great place, with quite a few activities on offer (archery, boat rides, abseiling to name a few). However, this hotel (and group) is for a certain group of Foreign tourists, earning good dollars. If you are living and working here, best look elsewhere.","A luxurious rip-off","2021-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r823441375-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Off season, but several other previous customers were staying during this period. Traditionally the hotel has been more or less inoperative during the summer monsoon months, allowing time for management vacations and any necessary repairs and renovations. So it was surprising to find various noisy and disruptive building works in the garden and front entrance area continuing into October.Two guests had to move rooms because of defective A/C units which are part of the original installations and should already have been replaced. The hot water failed 4 times in 2 weeks, twice because of failed solar heating panels. Active CCTV cameras were being installed as a consequence of recent property losses, but guests would be well advised to make full use of their room safes even for minor items; I wasn't impressed to find that one of the room boys had borrowed my tablet charger to recharge his mobile without my permission. It is always reassuring to find familiar faces when revisiting a hotel, and there had been no significant staff changes since my last visit, but one sensed that services are now on autopilot. One staff member is an obvious passenger who should be replaced, and this may be having a knock-on effect on other attitudes. It would have been helpful to discuss this with the owner, but surprisingly he had chosen to absent himself abroad for two weeks at the beginning of the season so there was no opportunity. Potential clients for whom his presence is a significant factor might make appropriate enquiries if they are planning any visits between mid October and mid December. One other issue needs to be addressed urgently, namely the malign practice of the owners of the adjacent property of burning rubber and other detritus right against the party wall behind the pool. There were several mornings when this threatened to make the pool and breakfast area  unusable. These comments may seem heavy, but this hotel charges premium rates, and guests are entitled to a premium experience for their money. Price is what you pay, but value depends on what you actually get. It might be useful if they entered the 21st century and provided departing guests with a customer satisfaction survey so that minor matters could be dealt with before they become major. Incidentally, the hotel's traditional clientele should not be discountenanced by the appearance of short stay mixed gender couples - this is entirely consonant with modern inclusivity culture.","Dickman Resort Negombo","2014-09","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2325134-r233417137-Dickman_Resort-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We are always grateful for feedback and we appreciate all your good compliments you give to us in the beginning of your mail and happy to inform you that we have made some changes based upon your comments. 

All mattresses in the Luxury Rooms and Suites have been renewed with Higher and Quality Softer Mattresses and the middle of this King Size Bed is hurt proof. We have also replaced all pillows with new ones made by the Number One Pillow maker Celcius.  Every bed is fitted out with Two High Soft Pillows and Two Low Stronger Pillow for the guest own choice. We hope you will check them one day in the near future.

About the sound of doors slamming, we found two doors needed to be soundproofed and this has been done.  We also ask staff to inform the new guests  with ""check in and check outs"" to take care for the guests in the house. Our staff is special trained not to speak in front of the Guest Rooms before 12 Noon to not disturbing the naturel mornings.  

After 5 o'clock PM the boys enjoy playing snooker or swimming for a few hours and most guests enjoy this friendly ambiance with them. About the music in the rooms, the English Speaking Room Boy who show the Room to arriving guest will never forget to show the button to turn the music on or of.  Thanks for that comment too.

About the Air Con on in the empty rooms.  Dickman Resort was awarded with the Green Boutique Villa award from Sri Lanka Tourist Board for our  ""Eco friendly Pool"" our 100% Solar Hot Water use and our Door Card Energy Saving System and we where very proud on this Originall Boutique Award.

This Door Card System is same as most Luxury Hotels where you leave the room and take the card out of the Energy holder and  automatically all electricity is switched off easy and safe. Officially it take 3 minutes to cool the rooms when the card is entered and it saves energy by nearly 40 % and it is one of our House rules to tell the guest at arrival.

Check in a breeze with a friendly attentive staff.  The grounds and pool are lovely and the large staff keeps the public areas impeccable.  The owner and staff far exceed most properties in their dedication to making guest welcome.
Wi-Fi is free if you settle your bill in cash otherwise there is a small fee.
Breakfast is served until noon which was wonderful for those coming in from different time zones. The chef was attentive and served a giant fruit plate referred to as fruit bread and egg’s to order.   Breakfast is included in the room rate along with juice, coffee or tea. The only downside is the constant barrage of flies, no seeum’s and mosquitos.  They do use inventive methods to reduce the problem and in fairness the problem is not restricted to Dickman’s but because of the table location and tree’s it was worse than at beach properties.
Lunch is available and how nice it is that they will accommodate guest until 6pm they serve a great choice of sandwiches, salad’s etc. at a very reasonable price. 
Room overview: They provided a beautiful floral and Mango fruit plate.
The bath products were Ayurveda Spa which were lovely.  The room has a min bar with enough room for personal items.
Concrete floors: This was only the second time in my life I have had concrete floors and the only real downside is concrete combined with 14 foot ceilings means sounds echo and exacerbates the noise issues I will address later.
If you enjoy a hard mattresses and don’t cuddle then you’ll enjoy the twin mattresses on a king platform.  To make it just a bit more challenging the sheets were twin.  So it is not only uncomfortable with the hard edges and split in the mattress but then you have a gap between the sheets.  At the very least they should use King Sheets. Pillows are a bit softer than sandbags .The linens are rough to the skin, same with the towels.   When I first used the towels they were stiff and rough.   Really they are not up to hotel standards.
The veranda doors have 1/4'” spacing between panels so there were a few mosquitos in the room.  Bring your replant and put up the netting they provide.     
One issue that was horrible, the room doors and the noise they make.  Every time a guest comes and goes you hear the slamming of doors. Some guests were just inconsiderate.  I would recommend the hotel weather strip the door jams to mitigate the noise.  Maybe also a kind word at check in about closing doors as you would like others to do for you if you were sleeping.  From that standpoint it seemed like we were staying in upscale youth hostel.  This is like a big house where you hear the music from other rooms where doors might be open or rooms being cleaned with the ever present music at different levels.  Yes there are number speakers in the rooms which I didn’t notice when I checked in the first night. My first morning when the house music was turned on the speakers blasted me awake.  That combined with no knowledge of how to turn the music off ruined the first morning.  I jumped up and scoured the room for the source and remote or switch and finally found a dial on the wall to turn it off.  The volume was so high that I suspect the room attendant had cranked it up while cleaning and never turned it down.  Another noise issue is the pool table in the lobby.  A poor concept with the high ceilings and cement floors.  You can hear every crack of the balls.  If you happen to be napping when someone decides to play your nap is over.
A/C and high vaulted ceiling are a great combination as long as you can run the a/c continuously. Unfortunately the hotel requested guest to turn off the a/c when you leave the room. Problem with that is when you return and are sweating from the heat you have to wait for the room to cool down.  If you leave the a/c on the staff enters your room and turns it off.  This is unacceptable and I would rather pay a higher room rate and enjoy a welcome respite from the heat when I enter my room.  The hotel is approx.  Two blocks from the beach and minimal local nightlife.
This is a property that with a few upgrades could be rated much higher.  At this point I could not recommend it until the bedding and linens are upgraded.","Needs some basic improvements","2012-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2325134-r148640071-Dickman_Resort-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Breakfast was a buffet style and was good with a nice range of options all well prepared and presented. The eving meal was also a buffet on the first evening and a set menu on the second. Unfortunately there was no vegetarian option on the set menu but after speaking with the staff we were told that the chef would prepare us something. That evening we went on dinner and had a lovely spring roll start followed by some soup. The main course of a Sri Lankan curry arrived and as I started to eat this I felt very unwell very rapidly. After a visit to the bathroom I had to retired to my room.feeling sick all evening until the next morning. I had not been unwell on this trip until.this time and had not eaten anywhere but the hotel. It is worth noting that my wife was not unwell at the time but had a bad stomach the following day.

To be fair the staff were genuinely concerned but the experience was unfortunate and clouded our experience of this hotel.

Staff very friendly and room spacious and in good order. 

Strangest thing though given the hotel is less than 20 years old - no lifts in the hotel so stairs only - fortunately we were on the first floor and the porter had to manhandle the suitcases for us!

Couple of issues that are easily fixed but if that is the case shouldn't have occured in the first place : 

Evening meal was a buffet - staff insist on dishing out the food meaning you have to keep asking them to add more or accept the small portions they put on your plate - probably just as well as the food was cold! - staff had to microwave ours to heat it up after we raised this with them.

Second issue was the live entertianment - vocally for non-local songs they were awfully lame and vague, the volume they played at in the bar was far too loud and indeed we could clearly hear it in our room after we retired  to bed.

If they ditch the live act and instead had some nice background jazz or lounge music as well as igniting the heaters under the food would easily sort this lot out!

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Belmont Boutique Hotel. Your feedback is invaluable in our constant endeavor to provide an exceptional stay for all our guests.

We are thrilled to hear that our concept of being a technical stopover for Westerners near the airport resonated well with you. Our strategic location and complimentary shuttle service are indeed designed to cater to travelers seeking convenience and efficiency in their transit. It is gratifying to know that our efforts in ensuring clean and well-equipped rooms have been appreciated. We understand how crucial these aspects are for a comfortable stay, especially when one is in transit and time is of the essence.

Regarding your observation about the noise levels, we truly empathize with your experience. Providing a peaceful and relaxing environment is a priority for us, and it seems we fell short of this goal during your stay. We are constantly working on ways to minimize external noise and improve sound insulation in our rooms. Rest assured, your feedback will be discussed with our team to explore further improvements in this area.

Your comment about the shuttle service is particularly concerning. While we strive to provide efficient transportation to the airport, it is paramount that this is done safely and comfortably. Your feedback about the driving style of our shuttle driver is being taken very seriously. We will address this with our transportation team to ensure that our drivers adhere to the highest standards of safety and sensitivity towards our guests' comfort.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and would like to assure you that your concerns are being addressed with the utmost seriousness. We are committed to not only meeting but exceeding the expectations of our guests.

It is feedback like yours that enables us to fine-tune our services. We hope that despite these issues, you will consider Belmont Boutique Hotel for your future travels, giving us the opportunity to provide you with a better experience.

Thank you once again for your valuable feedback.

Absolutely stunning. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, nothing was too much for them.

As for the hotel itself a bit of maintenance is required. Our air conditioning had one speed, flat out and the remote control was obviously not matched to the unit, or the unit was faulty. Hot water came and went and I have now decided to deduct 1* for every hotel I visit that doesn’t have thermostatic shower valves. There is no excuse for having a shower that is too cold one minute and too hot the next. I have given 3* but it would have been 2 had the guy who cleaned our room not entertained us so much with the towel origami every day. Great customer service.

The food!  So disappointing.  Main dishes were often cold even though kept on warmers but nothing was what you could have called tasty and well cooked. Very mediocre at best. Even the Sri Lankan dishes were not particularly tasty.  Certainly, our experience in Colombo was much better. Be warned drinks are very very expensive compared to other places we stayed at.","Staff were brilliant.

We are surprised Kuoni use this hotel for its guest’s especially having visited the Cinnamon Hotel and the food and service we had there was second to none.
We have found the service at the restaurant here quite poor especially at breakfast, for two consecutive mornings we had to ask for tea and on the second morning 5 times.  No toast the second morning as the toaster was broken.  We mentioned this to our rep and the hotel did apologise and offered us a complimentary meal.
Last night the restaurant was extremely busy with large tables and it was evident the kitchen and staff could not cope with the high volume.  The choices of food run out and there wasn’t any more of certain items especially in the dessert section.
I guess Kuoni use this hotel because of the stunning views and lovely pool, it is very tranquil.
However at 6.45am today we were woken by a constant knocking on metal I opened the door to find a young man brushing steps which was knocking on metal railings. He did stop when asked and apologised.
The hotel is a good base for the local sites and trips and the pool is lovely with stunning views but the ‘whole package’ lets this lovely hotel down.
Sadly we would choose another hotel if we came back to Sri Lanka.","Is stunning views enough?","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r979175293-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

The staff were lovely and attentive. We stayed in one of the wooden bungalows which are beautiful, however encountered some issues with the room.  Considering the price of the room the following issues were somewhat of a surprise to say the least: the A/C was leaking so much that it soaked to the top of the wooden wardrobe so much that the clothes hung up in the wardrobe got wet and needed dry cleaning. We then noted electric sparks coming from the exposed wiring that was running on top of the wardrobe. This is a health and safety issues and is unacceptable!
Not to mention the ants and bugs in the bathroom or the broken bathroom light. 
The reason this review is not 2 stars is that the staff came by and fixed the issues in a timely manner. However management was not willing to provide any meaningful compensation other than an 18 USD discount.","Beautiful hotel but some issues with the wooden chalet","2023-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r886688294-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

Ayubowan and warm greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you for taking the time to share your candid feedback. I’m truly sorry to hear that certain aspects of your stay did not fully meet the luxury standards we strive to uphold. Your comments regarding the spread-out facilities and the maintenance issues have been shared with our engineering and operations teams, who are already working to address them to ensure a smoother and more comfortable experience for all our guests.

I appreciate your remarks about our wildlife walks, and I’m delighted to know you enjoyed that aspect of your stay. Thank you for acknowledging our efforts in that area.

With regard to our culinary offerings, we do present a full variety of authentic local dishes alongside international options. We continuously seek to showcase the rich flavours of Sri Lanka, and I regret if this was not fully evident during your visit. I would welcome any specific suggestions you may have—be it particular regional specialties or preferred dishes—so that we can tailor our menus even more closely to your tastes on a future visit.

Thank you once again for your valuable feedback. We are committed to evolving and improving, and I hope you will give us another opportunity in the future to exceed your expectations.

Ayubowan! (May you live longer)

Email will not cut it. Avoid going here as a large group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I picked Jetwing Vil Uyana for a family trip based on a recommendation. The last time I was in the area we stayed at Uga Ullagala and given the similar pricing I had similar expectations. 

Check-in: experience was terrible. We arrived in a bus and sat in the parking lot while the staff figured out what to do with us and our luggage. It took a long time for us to get settled. When I booked I had notified Jetwing staff via email that I made two bookings but they even up to the day prior to arrival there was confusion. I was as disappointed that we were placed in rooms so far away from each other. When we arrived at our room they were still doing some construction work and we sat around waiting for the workers to leave so we could have some privacy. 

Food: breakfast and dinner service was slow. For our party size we had to commit 2 hours to a meal. There was also a bunch of confusion as the wait staff needed help knowing which seat to serve the food / drink orders. Quality of food was mixed. Some items were very good while others were poorly cooked and/or poorly plated. Again for the price paid, it did not meet expectations. Our guide also mentioned the food in their quarters was not good and that the hotel was experiencing chef issues. At this price point it should never happen. 

Drinks: the quality of drinks at the bar were poor. I have traveled extensively in Sri Lanka. We ordered every signature cocktail. Except for the 114 (which was phenomenal) everything else was terrible. So we had to resort to beer orders. 

Rooms: The rooms are very large, we stayed in one with a pool and had a great time overall despite the challenges. We enjoyed the morning view and hosting our family for pool parties. It was great. That said there were many rough edges - shoddy construction, termite droppings, unstable floors and railings;  all expected for a dwelling in the forest, but at this price point if Uga can figure it out, not sure why Jetwing cannot. 

Common areas: setting, lobby and main areas were just gorgeous. Spent hours watching the sun go up and down, the lake flora and fauna as well as the daily crocodile sighting. This is truly a special place to disconnect  

Staff: these hardworking folks are the saving grace of the hotel. If not for them it would be a 1 star rating. Saman is a standout. I had a last minute request to make an anniversary special, not only did he create a bouquet himself, but he also made the turndown service special and tried his very best to get a cake ordered from the kitchen. Nandhana was also very helpful as he tried to speed up food service and manage our experience given the limitations he had to work with. 

Unfortunately we will not be staying at this hotel or any other Jetwing property again.","Disappointed by Jetwing’s best hotel in SL","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r965055378-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

The pool had leaves in it when we arrived and more when we left two days later. Our first night in the second stay in Room 135 upon returning from dinner we found two piles of excrement on the floor of the downstairs bathroom space. We called housekeeping who came to clean the floor. He said bats came in because we had turned off the lights, however, when you go to dinner you take the keys with you which causes the lights to go off. We never had this unfortunate experience in Room 133. It felt like the staff had simply forgotten about Room 135 and us.

It was a long awaited visit to Vil Uyana and overall a good weekend was had by all. I was, however, terribly dissapointed with the food. I expected better than undercooked 'milk rice', pastry baskets consisting of tea buns and inconsistency between the menu & actual plate of food served (eg instead of cousous & slow cooked pork we were served rice & a pork chop of sorts that was not exactly slow cooked with of course no reason provided as to why we were not served what we requested). A little attention to detail would have been appreciated in this regard.

Considering the focus on animals and the wild life in the vicinity, I would also kindly request that you pay a little more kind attention to ""mans' best friend""...the dogs on the property & those having access to the property. They seemed to be lacking TLC, food and the puppies were extremely timid. I wonder if the collaboration with Embark is still active and ongoing.

Therefore we did expect  more personalised welcome and a experience. Which was not provided. We have stayed at similar star hotels at similar price ranges in Sri Lanka where this was provided. There was no enthusiasm at the reception. The  person who spoke to us with most enthusiasm was our buggy driver Nilantha,  he seems to be very dedicated and has to be commended. 

Hotel is located at a very unique environment and the architecture is breathtaking. We were very happy with the ambiance. 

We stayed in the room 134 and when we walked in to the room there was a Grass snake near the pond. Even though this is a nonpoisonous species, it did give us a scare!. 

Then only I noticed how the living room and the bed room was not swept completely and some sand and dust was still visible. It was difficult not to notice how the pond inside the living room needs cleaning. 
Our balcony light was not functioning, which we found out after dinner when we wanted to spend some time on the balcony. We did inform this to the receptionist and was attended to by the maintenance however they could not fix it and said they will look into it in the morning, however, this never happened!. 

Food was average or bellow average. My husband especially found the quantity and the variety very little. Most of the guests were Sri Lankan and we were provided with simple rice and curry as the Sri Lankan section and simple milk rice and pol roti ... we felt that if they had provided least some of hoppers or kottu for dinner.

I was especially disappointed with the dinner, we were provided with stale cold bread, I am sure the bread was brought before the covid time..... it was that old..  Could have least warmed up the bread, as expected from a five star hotel!......  also the ambiance was ruined by the singing heard from the kitchen staff!. Not professional at all.

We wanted to relax after the stressful covid times since both of us are frontline doctors. We did enjoy, however we did expect a better service.","Good with room for improvement","2020-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r757021049-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

You will be pleased to know that the hotel is built on a man-made wetland reserve, which was inspired by the London Wetland Centre. 12 years since inception, we are thrilled to see that the environment has worked well for bird life and elusive creatures such as the Grey slender loris, fishing cat and otters, who have trusted us with their presence. Our property has now become a prime location for nature lovers. We also have a loris conservation site to protect this elusive, endangered species. 

We hope you will visit us again and take up a night trail with our environmentalist for a glimpse of this wildlife at work. Look forward to welcoming you again.

While appreciating your compliments we are of course most concerned to hear of your dissatisfaction. You were upgraded to the highest dwelling category in our property which includes a private lap pool, an extensive bathroom with an indoor garden and pond as well as an outdoor sitting area. We are quite surprised to hear your description of this dwelling which otherwise is highly regarded by our other guests. 

However we have noted your comments on poor lighting and insufficient storage facilities in the room and would like to extend our sincere apologies for these inconveniences.  

Also the hotel is not built on a swamp. It is built on a man-made wetland inspired by the London Wetland Center and is our own proud contribution to mother nature.

Considering the above information, we do hope you will visit us again and we look forward to welcome you again.

Ayubowan (May you live long)

I should say that one of us didn’t mind at all but one of us found it uncomfortable. We had booked a water bungalow but were “upgraded“ to a forest dwelling, which as it indicates is in the heart of the forest with no view. It has a small plunge pool that is in shade most of the day. The dwelling is huge but the downstairs is entirely occupied by a vast gloomy concrete bathroom, including a loo with no door, exceedingly poor lighting, and unusable bath. There was insufficient light to shave or make up by. There is one living room upstairs with nowhere to sit except a wooden bench or outside. There was absolutely nowhere to store clothes so we were obliged to live out of cases for two days amongst piles of stuff. On the plus side, we found the staff helpful and charming and the evening menu was interesting fusion cooking, we both enjoyed our meals. Our advice would be to check very carefully what facilities you are being offered before deciding on the type of villa. And by the way, the hotel is constructed in a swamp and you will need high percentage deet spray.","Very ambivalent about this hotel","2018-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r635329702-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

The bedroom upstairs was huge and had a large bed with mosquito net and another toilet and washbasin. This was over-run with ants.

Its a hotel restaurant, so we were expecting some standards after hearing that the hotel is one of the best inn the area.  We were offered a set menu for dinner at USD$40 per person.  We asked for an All-Day menu because we were not that hungry and didn’t want a 3-course meal.  The waiter said there is no other menu.  So we had to choose from the set menu (3-course meal). We chose Thai fish cakes, Thai red curry and choc brownie.  The starter was tiny portion and we thought..that’s not a good start.  The Thai red curry was mediocre- rubbery chicken and dessert was nothing to shout about.  About half way through our meal, another couple sat next to us and they were given the same set menu.  They had to ask 3 times for the All-day menu.  We were quite shocked when they’ve got the All-day menu, which was more selection of food and obviously a lot cheaper.  It’s not about the price that we were worried about, it’s the fact that we were lied to about the menu.  We didn’t say  anything to the staff because we didn’t want to cause any hassle.  We just want to finish our dinner and leave.  Never again.  The food was overly priced (we had better quality, Michelin standard food for cheaper and tastier), we were lied to and we never going to come again.

Thank you for your review and naturally I am very sorry that you were disappointed with the food you were served.

I have already had a meeting this morning with our Executive Chef about this, and he is going to talk to the staff in the kitchen at KK Beach, and also speak to the supplier of the beef, to try and ascertain why the meat was tough - and why the dessert was so sweet.

Clearly this is very disappointing and I can only apologize to you all for what was clearly a poor meal. Perhaps you were too kind in your ""gentle"" comments about the toughness of the beef to the staff hence they failed to take it as a complaint and offer you a discount etc . I will have a meeting with them myself and explain how they should deal with such situations.

Since you clearly know KK, I would ask that you write to me direct - george@kkcollection.com - and I will be more than happy to offer you a complimentary dinner when you are next in Sri Lanka - by way of apology.

Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to having the opportunity to rectify a wrong.

With best wishes for the New Year,

Geore Cooper

The beach side setting is superb, impressive views, a lovely setting and wonderful to watch the sun go down with a  drink.

Welcoming and friendly staff. 

We had the three course set menu (circa £21)  which was billed on the website as  “Thai fusion”.  

The starters were good: superb soup, tuna and avocado tasty and pineapple and onion appetising.

The filet of beef was ordered by three of our party and all found it tough and disappointing. The veg was predominantly flavoured with cumin, Thai flavours not coming through.  The Mahi Mahi was nicely cooked with turmeric and was on a bed of beetroot relish, this too powerfully flavoured by cumin in my opinion. 

Gentle feedback about the beef was given. No offer of a discount to the bill applied.

The dessert  of lime and passion fruit tart was expected to be refreshingly tart but it was too sweet,  compounded further by its strawberry drizzle.

KK, you can do better than this, we know.......

Seemed like a comfy place to set base in for the remaining half of our stay in Sri Lanka. We'd settled on it as we wanted to be somewhere quiet and not too far from the beach or places of interest. KK didn't fail us on these factors. It's situated next to a busy road, but only occasionally can you hear the traffic beyond the wall or the train coming from/going to Habaraduwa station which is about 10 mins walk. 

The only constant you'll hear are the waves. But during our stay, we did hear thumping of music on some evenings from downstairs (we were on the 2nd level). Because the hotel's small with only a few units, conversations along the corridor can also get amplified if one's not mindful of their volume. We heard on two occasions other guests talking along the corridor. Made us a bit more conscious of ourselves as well when were in the corridor.

Pros:
● Transport isn't a problem here as most drivers know KK. The boys at front desk can help you get a tuk tuk or you can go out as there're always one or two waiting across the road. Just let the hotel's guard know and he'll flag one for you. 

For our stay, we were lucky to flag an honest driver called Lalith. He didn't try to hard sell tourist traps to us. He'd suggest them to us just once and knew how to respect our wishes when declined, never pushing it to us again. (Unlike some drivers we'd come across). Because of this, we used his services for the rest of our days at KK. 

● Hotel location. It's not too far from places of interest such as Galle Fort (20 mins in good traffic) and Koggala lake. Weligama is also a few mins away. Unawatuna's tourist beach area's a short drive. 

● Amenities such as supermarket (Cargills) and Habaraduwa village centre with some shops are within walking distance. (About 10 mins.) There's also a provision shop across the road from the hotel, few doors down on your right from the furniture shop. Good for when it's dark and you can't walk to Cargills. (Not recommended to walk to Cargills at dusk as the streetlights aren't that bright and the bus and lorry drivers here are reckless. We tried and it was terrifying.) This shop isn't fully stocked though and has only items such as drinks, instant noodles, biscuits and traveler basics such as shampoo and detergent sachets. The shop's kind of like a village store. It's a bit run down so some might find it a turn off. It's also easy to miss if you're not looking out for it.
 
Sadly, despite these factors, there isn't much else to rave about KK. There were a few lapses and the service quality we received wasn't on par with the price we paid for our stay. I know tourism is something relatively new to the country and thus levels of service generally isn't something to shout about at most places. But coming from a place that's highly regarded locally as KK, standards should be better. 

Cons: 
● Front desk staff are mostly in their office. Everytime we needed something, I'd to knock on their door which was a bit awkward. Felt as if I was bothering them each time they'd to come out. Don't quite know what the reception table outside's for if it's never manned. Should consider having a bell on the table so that we can ring for them or at least have a staff on rotation at the desk. At one of the hotels we stayed in during our trip, they didn't have a reception desk but the front office managers were always visible and approachable to guests. KK should look into this.

Their night shift front desk staff (small sized fella), always looked dazed. (Maybe because it was at the end of his shift both times I encountered him.) He didn't seem to understand English very well. On two occasions another staff had to translate what I was saying to him. For a front desk staff, he should have some minimum if not basic grasp of the language like his other colleagues.

● Staff seems dispirited. Except for the gardeners and guards, almost everybody seemed to just be going through the motions of their jobs. There was no sense of eartnestness and warmth in their service. I felt this with the front desk staff who brought us to our room on check in day as well. Not too sure if he just wanted to be done quickly so as to give us space and privacy. If so, it wasn't being conveyed well.

This was felt even more with the restaurant staff. Smiles were hard to come by when it came to them. You do get it, but it isn't a regular thing. Maybe because it's early morning or low season so they feel less motivated. But their faces are the first ones we see at the start of our day over breakfast, it does make a difference to guests. When I was in the service industry, we were always told that the moment we put on our uniforms, regardless of the bad day/problems we've, we need to put them aside and be 'actors' for our customers to make their experience/interaction with us a pleasant one. 

The only two smiling faces we encountered was a wait staff whose name we didn't get (unfortunately as they didn't seem to wear name tags). But he's easy to spot as he has really thick, curly hair. (Most of the boys we saw had short, crew cuts.) The other was Dinesh, a front desk staff with the day shift. He always seems to know if we're at the lobby and would come out to make conversation. Not just about our stay but sharing his experiences as a local and a resident of the town we were in as well. That was nice of him and a good insight into life there. 

● Food was a let down. I ordered a Sri Lankan breakfast and the yolk in my hopper wasn't runny, but fully cooked. Not too sure if this is how it's also done as the ones I've tried elsewhere always had runny yolks. I'd the same with my eggs benedict another morning. Other than the menu items, the hotel also offered a small breakfast spread which was made up of muffins, local fruits, muesli, milk and another thing or two I can't remember. But the spread was quite uninspiring and minimal in variety. If breakfast was any indication of the quality of food the restaurant served, we were quite disappointed and turned off by it overall. We didn't know of anywhere else to go for breakfast, so that couldn't be helped, but we ate our lunches and dinners out most days during sightseeing as we didn't want to relive the disappointment at the hotel.

● Service is really bad at the restaurant. They usually seemed reluctant or often had this terrified look on their face when they'd to interact with us. At times, they don't seem to know how to handle guests. One morning, the pad on my chair was soaked. I brought it to attention to one of the wait staff. He didn't seem to know what to do. I then took a replacement from another chair. Even as I gave him my damp chair pad, he was expecting me to place it on the other chair. I told him again that it was damp. I couldn't possibly put it there for someone else to sit on. Only then did it register on him that he should take and put it out to dry. Made me wonder as to how they could've not noticed the wet chair pad. Doesn't the restaurant do checks before starting service each day and how did the chair pad even get soaked when it wasn't raining? 

On another occasion, the staff came with our orders. It was a Sri Lankan breakfast so there were a few dishes that they'd to place on our table. Before I could've even move a bag to make space, the staff took the liberty to remove it from the table for us. He should've at least ask if he or we could move the bag for him. (His colleague did so on another morning.) It contained my husband's camera lenses, which were heavy and expensive, thus careful handling was needed. This was also one of the factors which turned us off from eating our other meals there. The staff just made dining such a frustrating experience, sadly.

In all, KK Beach is nice and peaceful. It has a good seaview. But unfortunately, that's all that's wonderful. A pity because it seems that the hotel is highly spoken of. Almost everywhere in Sri Lanka, whenever they know we were staying/stayed at KK, everyone had something to say. The owner of one of the hotels we stayed in during our trip raved about KK. (And this hotel was in another town.) So did a friend of ours who is a hotelier (who was based in the capital) and even our tuk tuk driver. On another occasion, the jeweler whom I bought gems from wanted to waive off my delivery fee when he heard we were at KK. He spoke highly of its owner and the hotel. Such was the reputation of the place. Sadly, it didn't seem to live up to it for us. 

Somehow, we seemed to have missed out on the quality food and service that the good reviews were raving about. Maybe we were here at the wrong time, since it was low season and hence so was staff morale. Regardless, they should not let it show through. It can really make or break someone's stay, like it did for us. Truly a waste for such a beautiful hotel to be dragged down by things as basic as customer service and food. 

Would we come back here? Unfortunately, no. But we would consider their other property Kahanda Kanda next time. Hopefully it'd be better than this and just as excellent as the reviews say it is.","Beautiful Location, Disappointing Service","2018-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r605688741-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly may I apologise for the fact that you were woken by the noise from the building works next door. It is no excuse, but a new sub contractor had started work that morning, and he was unaware that we had stipulated no noise to be made until 8.30am out of consideration to our guests. The site foreman had not passed on this information, but ultimately it was our responsibility,  and for that I am very sorry. We did upgrade you, by way of a gesture of compensation, and we have greatly reduced our rates for the duration of the construction, and have ensured that guests are aware of this when booking. In fact we have worked hard to minimise any inconvenience to guests, and even though the works started on May 1st, yours is the first complaint from a guest.

With regards to the tuk tuk drivers outside, this is genuinely something that it out of our control. We do have a tuk tuk and driver for guests if they wish to use our services, otherwise we would call for a reputable driver from outside. However complaints against tuk tuk drivers are not an uncommon occurrence throughout Sri Lanka, and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. We cannot be held accountable for their behaviour.

Finally, I am saddened that you feel the staff could smile more - Sri Lankans by nature are extremely friendly and smiley, and even the latest review here comments on how smiley all the staff were, so I am at a loss to understand why you felt this way.

With best wishes,

The suite which we were upgraded to was spacious and artfully decorated. The ocean view from our room was stunning especially during sunset. 

However, there was construction going on literally across the wall because the hotel is expanding. We were initially told that there would be some noise from 8:30am to about 5pm. Unfortunately, we were woken up at 7am the next morning from loud hammering. The hotel manager Sanjeewa offered to move us to a suite further away from the construction and it was much quieter. 

Another incident we encountered during our stay was the tuk tuk driver waiting/camping outside the hotel. His charges were high and was very possessive. We took his number because he told us he could show us turtle hatching on the beach but somehow he got the idea that he would be controlling our trip. He got upset when we took other tuk tuk and came to confront us at the hotel beach area and called us bad people and told us he knew all the places we went to. That was so out of line and creepy. The hotel should do more to prevent such people from coming in contact with its guests. 

Overall, the management team had a good problem solving attitude. The service team could use a little more smile. Not sure if the chef has changed, the food was okay but not spectacular.

the pros
the manager mohan is very good.
the billiards room is well made.
the spa rooms are very nicely made. 
the hot water swimming pool is nice.
the chef is trying his best to do what he can. he made some onion fritters which were amazing.
the palace theme is nicely done with a nice dining room.
mohan went out of the way to help us with everything including finding 2 sisters to sing some Christmas songs on Christmas eve. also having one of the staff accompany us to a local temple and another one to take us trekking.
the rooms have very comfortable beds and linen and nice Jacuzzis in the bathroom.

the cons
there is no tea plantation view. there is a junk yard that can be seen from the garden and our bedrooms had the view of some sort of a factory in the back or the villa. the rooms on the first floor have front facing views which is better than the second floor villa where we were. we chose nuwariyaeliya for its serene tea plantations.
the place is overpriced to pay 500 usd a night for 300 sq ft rooms is too much. the rooms are small.
the food was mediocre the chef tried to do his best but maybe our vegeterian dietary requirements were tough for him to meet. he did try making dosa which were good but the chutney was sour. they did give us some amazing vurgin mojitos on Christmas eve. for the price we paid we expected much better quality food.
the butler did not have basic skills in laying out a table. the food would come but there would not be any cutlery. they are trying to do their best but they need to be properly trained.
usually have to wait 20 to 30 mins before dinner or breakfast is laid out.
ther is not enough channels to watch as they had to pay for hbo etc if we payinh 500 usd a night the most basic thing to buy is to buy a smart TV so we can link up our phone to the tv than.
everything is imported from China including the jacuzzi and furniture and some places the crappy Chinese quality can be seen. our buttons on jacuzzi were not working. the door handle came off. the paint on the edge of the dining table was scraping off.
overall the intentions of creating a palace is appreciated but staff needs to be better trained and they can't do anything about the view so if u want to enjoy the indoors it is great but don't expect much from the outdoors.

The beds are comfy and the swimming pool is small but perfect for a morning dip. It's right on the beach but sadly not the best beach which is about ten minutes down the road at the marina or where the locals go swimming at the public beach. 

The food is fine but not great - after one meal we decided to abandon the hotel restaurant and try other local places instead - go to Vasuki it's a short tuktuk ride but provides some of the best traditional food anywhere on Sri Lanka. 

The staff are very pleasant but we had to ask them two days in a row to tidy our room up. 

The a/c broke and was repaired quickly but a whole host of dead flies was left on the floor after the workman left. The large double bathtub was also broken when we arrived this was also kind of fixed but it took so long to fill you'd just never bother using it. The television was fuzzy and pretty much unusable and the wifi took me back to the days of dial up it was so slow. 

Culturally there's very little to do around Pasikudah. There are watersports in the area which are fun - we jet skied because the snorkling and diving were unavailable due to poor water clarity - and if that's you're thing there enough choice to keep you busy for a couple of days.

Overall it's still a slice of tropical paradise and if you're just a sun worshipping beach lover then you'll have a perfectly nice time. We just felt we'd had far better service in much more slickly run hotels around the island. If you were backpacking around Asia staying in small b&bs and decided to treat yourself for a night this place would seem like heaven. If however you were spending a little more on a luxurious trip you might well be sadly disappointed by the lack of attention to detail.

* Service in the restaurant and at the pool/beach: very often we had almost finished our meal when the ordered drinks were finally arriving at our table. No proactive service at all at the pool or beach.
* Food variety not great (we had half board). Sri Lanka has such a big variety of fruits. We only found the standard 3 fruits (wateremelon, pineapple, papaya) each day. Other hotels that were cheaper with less stars had much bigger choice for breakfast as well as for dinner. No variations for the desserts, also no big choice and variations for the main dishes. We had much better food for example in the Cinnamon Citadel in Kandy!
* WLAN speed was unacceptable. Loading of every page took hours or was interrrupted before loading was complete. In some rare occasions, I was able to watch a video on Youtube. We mentioned the slow connection to the staff. They told us they would try to do something about it. Only the last day, they specifically asked for our IP adress. This helped to speed the connection up for the given device. 
* The beach is not good for swimming in the ocean as the water is far too shallow, even during highest water.
* there is nothing offered concerning watersport or anything to entertain the kids. No stand up paddling or anything.
* All excursions offered are incredibly expensive. So that we did not book anything.
* The water in the black pool turns too hot. I guess that the water temperature was 40°C or above. Almost like a Thermal Water Spa. 

To mention on the positive side:
* very good room service. Very clean. Staff very polite.
* very nice style and size of the rooms

Greetings From The Sun Aqua Pasikudah and Sun Siyam Resorts Sri Lanka,

Thank you for taking the time to review and rate us on TripAdvisor.

First and foremost, Thank you for patronizing our charming resort.
We regret that you did not enjoy your stay with us and did not obtain the desired and everyday positive experience that our resort caters to all our guests. The Sun Aqua takes a lot of initiative and aim to deliver a private luxurious beach getaway in line with Maldivian heritage as a luxury boutique resort.

To address you....

Regret the concerns on our pool and room,bathroom designs. However do note that this is our unique concept and  to differentiate our resort from others in the area with much pride as an all suite resort with an infinity black pool. This is a concept that we take pride and which appeal to many of our guests, I feel it is not fare to subject the concept and label the same as "" wasted spaces "" based on the respective perspective and judgment of you alone. Perhaps Sun Aqua was not what you were looking for or was not wrong resort at the wrong time.

Your concerns on staff knowledge, lack of room amenities and faculty shortcomings are noted and we regret a and apologize for the same. Guest satisfaction is of paramount importance and if we were unable to change your room it is only because we were completely booked.All of us extend to you our sincere apologies again on the same.

Going forward you and your family are most welcome again at the resort should you decide the same, I believe the second time can be the charm.

Till then....
Ayubowan

Pitch black pool but advertised as a turquoise pool. My son is 2.5 years old and was afraid to get in to the pool because of the color.even the baby pool was black. We had a jacuzzi that did not work. We had a minibar which was completely empty and did not cool anything we put in there. The AC takes forever to cool the room. No bath slippers or beach slippers, it's a suite after all! The rooms and the hotel in general are not very safe for toddlers and small children, take a look at the pictures wires hanging out in the open and the room has split levels. Bathroom is huge and pointless because the shower cubicle is small compared to the space. Front Patio is a complete waste of space. I don't know if anyone ever use it? Veranda at the back leading to the beach is good if you have a good view only.generally the housekeeping and f&b staff were very polite and helpful. Front staff ok but need improvement on knowledge. I told them I want to omit the buffet and get a sandwich instead. They at once said NO! I had to tell them to contact f&b manager and ask and the f&b manager was kind enough to honor my request.
We also wanted to change the room because of split levels and wanted to speak to the FOM, front staff said they don't have a FOM and their supervisor arrives only after 2.30!

Having seen the ""family villa"" on the website, it sounded perfect for us: 2 rooms in one building, the implication that the kids could enjoy the upstairs while we took the room downstairs. However if your kids are small, take note: the rooms are not connected and both have an outside door, accessible to anyone passing by. Further, you can't see or hear from downstairs what's going on upstairs. Wholly unsuitable if you want to keep an eye on your children. Ours are a bit older now, but we weren't really prepared to ""leave them to it"".

On the plus side, when we expressed that the villa was unsuitable, we were upgraded straight away, which we very much appreciated. What we got was a single-storey pair of rooms with an interconnecting door and a private plunge pool. It opened directly onto the beach and we were absolutely delighted.

The rooms themselves were stylish, impeccably clean, spacious and comfortable. The hotel pool was excellent and there were plenty of sun loungers.

The food was variable. The website talks up its restaurant offerings - but they were not as wide-ranging as it makes out. The buffet wasn't amazing, though when we ordered from the menu the food was very good.

We thought the hotel let itself down a bit the service. The people were very friendly but not really on the ball. For example, we asked for drinks at the pool bar that just didn't appear, and got laundry done that we had to chase up as it went several hours past the deadline promised. I think things could have been a lot better organised.

In summary: lovely hotel, friendly people, in our opinion probably not the 5 star quality it claims, but has potential to be if it gets slicker with service.","Lovely hotel, friendly people but could tighten up on service","2016-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r402732414-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

So please be very careful about hidden costs when using booking.com. The hotel was completely unhelpful in trying to rectify the situation and basically offered no other option but to stay for the seven nights at full costs.  When we arrived, the villas were also unsuitable for families as they consist of two separate apartments meaning we couldn't leave our children alone. Again, hotel completely unhelpful in providing alternatives.  The food is also extremely expensive - we were quoted  at $50 per day for half board which in the general context of Sri Lanka is an awful lot of cash.

Having said all that, the hotel aspires to be a luxury resort and generally succeeds in its ambition.  The rooms are spacious although [prone to things going wrong - we had to call out the handy man a few times to fix doors, electricity and AC. The pool is lovely, and position on the beach is good.  Passikudah beach is a bit soulless though - just a strip of luxury hotel followed by luxury hotel.  We much preferred Kalkuddah beach which was deserted and magnificent. Because of the prohibitive cost we opted to eat out - we jumped in a Tuk Tuk and visited the excellent Nandawanam Guest House which was a fraction of the cost of the hotel.

General feeling is that this is a generally decent luxury beachside hotel but not worth the money.","Watch Our fof Hidden Costs!","2016-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r399265619-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The good things:
- the beach and pool - beautiful, pool is always warm, beach clean with plenty of loungers. As you are essentially doing a beach trip to here the importance of this cannot be underestimated! 
- the A la carte menu - really good food

What we didn't like:
- we had big problems with the AC. It barley worked and made a really loud clicking noise all night. We complained the next morning and it was fixed but started again late that night. The staff knew immediately what we were talking about so clearly not a new issue. 
- The buffet. Just not to our tastes - a wide selection but slightly cold, good mix of local and international - just all tasted a bit bland. Some people seemed to be really enjoying it - but prob not for foodies (the a la carte was fab though!)
- The bathrooms. Really dated look about them - old style fixtures, things not finished that well. Outside so high mozzie risk. 
- Mosquitoes - now I know this is a tropical country, and i was obviously expecting to get munched upon by mozzies.. however we stayed in top end hotels and usually they spray for mozzies regularly and the number of bites is reduced. This is the only place we stayed in sri lanka where I got bitten. 
- Attention from the staff.. people were clearly keen to try to please but a few things upset us. We asked for help removing a frog - which the staff then killed in front of us (we just wanted it moved!), the AC problem was dealt with quickly but re-occurred and no compensation was offered, the team spoke to us personally and had a long chat at dinner - the next day the same team member introduced himself again. If you are going to chat to guests you have to actually remember them! 

We didn't overall hate it! Just felt it was a lot of money for what we got. The pool and beach were good though.

We were in Sri Lanka and stayed in 10 hotels, the Villas at the Reef are really  nice, really large colonial style, with lovely furniture and comfortable beds with mosquito nets. Worth the price of the of the rooms. 

The food in the restaurant was also good, particularly at breakfast. Perhaps not quite as high as the expectation we had from other reviews. The main complaint was the relatively small menu didn’t change for the 3 nights we were there.

Our main beef was the prices of the drinks (in particular), and the food. There is limited choice locally for food, but beer was the most expensive we paid in our whole time there, so unsurprisingly we didn’t tend to drink in the hotel restaurant or at the pool, a shame. 

The beach is lovely and the service was great, particularly Dino who was always so keen to please, and had a nice sense of humour.

The manager Mike and the rest of the team on site were helpful and again keen to please.

The building is not old, in fact it was built in 2008.  We incorporated antique architectural features and wonderful artefacts into the design which you may not have realised.

I personally greeted you on arrival and walked you into the hotel which I do with all guests.  I made every effort to introduce to you the property but you showed no interest and walked off mid sentence.  I didn’t blame your children for anything whatsoever, that is completely disingenuous?

I feel you have over played issues on your stay and the real issue for your negative review is the issue with take away pizza which you never mentioned.  

You called our office and asked if it was OK to bring in take away pizzas and you were informed that outside food was not allowed to be brought in or consumed in the hotel.  You gave an angry response to that person and demanded that I speak with you.

I immediately called you and you didn’t take my call but your husband did and I informed him the same.

You nevertheless ordered pizzas and ferreted them into your suite disregarding our hotel policy.

While we encourage our guests to treat the hotel like their home, our suites are antique laden with fine silk fabrics and I was extremely unhappy that you left leftover pizza and pizza boxes in our beautiful suite. 

The bathrooms lights are not at fault.  When you stayed it was the beginning of the monsoon rains and so there were frequent power cuts.  We have a full back up generator that takes over in the event of a power cut and takes under 10 seconds to take over.

The adorable puppies are our golden retrievers Fred and Wilma and our guests love them.

Yes they are bouncy but they are fun loving puppies.

You raised a few issues, which I would like to respond to:

Electricity. In Sri Lanka there is often a problem with power, so we have a full back up generator, which immediately and automatically takes over in the event of a power cut.

If you remember the night you stayed there was a big storm and a mains power cut from time to time and so our generator took over automatically and you were never without power for more than 10 seconds.  This also affects the WiFi as the provider relies on the local electricity supply.

You mentioned this when you were leaving and I explained this to you.

Regarding toiletries, we replenish our toiletries daily and our housekeeping records confirm this.  There were four of you staying in one suite and our record also confirmed additional items such as additional dressing gowns placed in the room.

With all due respect I think you may be mistaken as four of you were occupying the suite and one of the party may have entered the bathroom and opened a bottle.

We have a two-part housekeeping process before handing over a suite to a guest.  After the suite is serviced, the housekeeping manager signs it off and the general manager does a final inspection.

All our suites have a comprehensive range of luxurious toiletries by Kama Ayurveda.  We are the only hotel in Sri Lanka using this exclusive Indian brand and we just love share them with our guests!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"78 Samanthara Rd, Wadduwa 12560 Sri Lanka","Wadduwa","Sri Lanka","12560",,"78 Samanthara Rd","","1233956","6.659596","Wadduwa, Western Province","79.92986","Reef Villa & Spa","634","4.9","6","2","11","32","583","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499081-d1233956-Reviews-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html","https://www.facebook.com/ReefVillaandSpa/?ref=ss","2017-04-15","MOBILE","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were looking for a nice place to stay at the last night prior to our departure that is a bit close to the airport, and we ended up booking at the Reef Villa & Spa.

The positive things about the Reef in my opinion are the following: 1* room is really big and has a unique style and specious bathroom, 2* food is SO delicious, 3* surroundings are peaceful, 4* there is a chance to experience riding an elephant (Monica, the village elephant), 5* owner and his staff are extremely friendly.

On the other hand, some of the things that bothered us were as follows: 1* as soon as we arrived and opened the car door to step out, two dogs jumped on us -- turned out to be the owner's dogs (what a reception!), 2* some of the toiletries provided were used as you can see from the attached picture, 3* no tissues were provided in the room (and when ordered, they brought a torn off box filled with wrinkled tissues as you can see from the attached picture), 4* room had lots of insects, 5* electricity went off several times at night, 6* poor wifi connection, 7* no one was at the reception at night when we needed to request something (we rang the bell, as instructed, and waited for so long without any luck -- fortunately, we saw one of the staff passing outside and we went to talk to him.)

The entrance area was enchanting, paths weaving through flowering shrubs and past tranquil fish ponds.  All very zen.  Our suite on the first floor of the main house has to be one of the finest we have ever stayed in, and we have been lucky enough to stay in some very fine places.  We stayed in an Ocean Suite the first night and it was basically the same style of room but without a view and darker inside. The food was excellent, we enjoyed all our meals and there was a large choice on the menu which didn't change.  The Sri Lankan breakfast which has to be ordered the day before was particularly good.  The hotel should only be graded excellent but the service is not at all up to scratch for a very expensive, luxury hotel and that drags it down to average.  The restaurant staff don't speak much English at all and this made for a frustrating time for everyone (staff included) when ordering.  We were frequently given the wrong dish which became tedious especially as the food is expensive and the service slow.   The suite was kept immaculately but again very slow in servicing, a couple of times they were still there at lunch time when I wanted to tidy up before lunch after swimming.  For evening turndown you fill in on a card which time you would like it done and hang it outside the door, an arrangement I haven't seen before and that worked well.  Most of our days were cloudy and as the hot water is solar powered it ran out.  There is an auxiliary method of heating but this plainly wasn't turned on until we remarked that we had had no hot water for 24 hours.  Again, no hot water is not acceptable in an expensive hotel.  The manager is very helpful and very hands on, as he is the only person who speaks good English he has to sort out all problems himself.  The beach is very long but very narrow so there is no space for loungers on the beach.  We were advised only to swim in the sea during the morning, it wasn't deep enough for swimming as such but gorgeous warm water and rolling waves which were fun.  We felt there was a lack of anywhere to sit to enjoy a drink before dinner, or indeed any time.  A couple of tables by the pool but that is not a change of scene and if they were occupied the only option was to go into the restaurant and not have a drink first.  Sitting in the main house didn't seem to be encouraged which is a shame as it would have been delightful to sit there but it was too warm even by the evening anyway.  A terrace area with tables, chairs and parasols at the end of the garden looking  out to sea would be extremely pleasant.  It would be helpful to say on the website under the excursions how much each one costs and how long they last.  We went on the one to Richmond Castle which was very interesting.","Disappointing for the price.","2016-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r345829342-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

It is a beautifully designed facility with very interesting rooms and big bathrooms (at least ours was big).  It was so peaceful and lovely and a great way to start and relax into our vacation and get over our jet lag.  The food was also quite good -- a nice mixture of Sri Lankan and Western Food available.  (You must order the Sri Lankan breakfast in advance, however, as it takes longer to make.)

The main downside to this property was the service.  Compared to the other places we stayed during our trip, the service was particularly lackluster here.  It was quite lethargic and to be honest, they could have made a lot more money out of us had they tried a bit harder. (I sat by the pool most days and was only asked once if I'd like anything to drink.  Because it is the Monsoon and not high tourist time here, there were only 4 of us staying at the resort so this could have been because they were short staffed.)  Also, the most irritating thing is that unlike every other hotel we stayed in here, they didn't include service or taxes in their prices a BIG surprise at the end.  And their prices were high.  A 30-minute head drip in their spa was $85.  That is significantly more than we paid in any other hotel here (and we were in luxury hotels across Sri Lanka -- all to the standard of this one) and even more than we pay at home in New York City!  We were quite shocked by this... 

So, although we did relax and enjoy our time here, it was definitely not a highlight.","Beautiful Facility, Service could use some work...","2014-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r237190267-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

As you were fully aware, breakfast is included in your suite rate.  If you wish to order room service, which you did several times, this is chargeable and this was clear from the menus in your suite, which you agreed to and signed for.

A honeymoon breakfast in your suite, is available as part of one of our honeymoon packages.  However you did not select this concierge option.

When you stayed with us it was the Monsoon season and therefore off-season. Although the weather was sunny and without rain for the duration of your stay, the seas can be rough and we quite rightly advised against swimming in the sea.  As you know have a beautiful swimming pool. 

From November to April, the sea is wonderful, and superb for swimming, all of which we told you about when you booked and arrived in September.

But we were constantly phoned by the staff if we had not put our dinner order in at lunch time and it felt like our every move was being monitored, the turn down service, although good, was always done whilst we were still in our room getting ready for dinner or just trying to have some private time, as was the cleaning in the morning, I couldn't quite understand why this was as we were mostly the only guests at the resort so the staff could easily have serviced the room whilst we were not in it!  My husband also took exception to being charged £15 each for having breakfast in the room one morning instead of the restaurant (which was approx 50 yds from our room!) He felt that,as we had already paid for breakfast in the room rate, we should be allowed to have it in our room if we wished, after all, it was our honeymoon, a once in a lifetime occasion so we felt that perhaps
(being that we we were the only guests at the time) we would be granted this request gratis, little touches like this,go a long way to making the perfect trip for me. 
I also felt very uncomfortable when the staff were apologising about us having to pay and were themselves uncomfortable that they had to ask for payment, they clearly felt it was an un-necessary added expense. 
The manager was excellent at arranging trips for us, I would recommend a driver they use called Supan, nothing was too much trouble, he really was wonderful.

I loved Sri Lanka and overall,my stay at Reef was a pleasant one, I do hope I am not going to get a telling off by the owners for my review (as others on here have),it is just my personal opinion and hopefully will be taken as it is meant, as constructive not destructive.

One last thing though, the complaint by a reviewer that you cannot swim in the sea is a valid one, we were in fact told by the owner when we arrived NOT to swim in the sea due to the dangerous under current so he should be honest about this as if people are expecting to relax on the beach and swim in the sea,(like I was expecting) they will be disappointed, I think it is important for the owners to not take the crticism personally and feel they have to defend every point, it isn't their fault that the sea is not swimmable and the beach is far from perfect,these things are out of their control, perhaps what they could focus on is areas that they do have control over and not take constructive criticism as a personal slight. I wish Reef the very best for the future.

Your claim that the beach is a dirty strip of land is simply ridiculous and utter nonsense; with respect you obviously didn’t set foot on it.  The golden sandy beach stretches for miles with leaning palm trees reminiscent of a Bounty Bar ad along with Monica the village elephant strolling lazily along the beach with her mahout.  This beats any donkey ride.  Contrary to your claim that the sea is not swimmable this is simply nonsense; it is the Indian Ocean with beautiful warm temperatures all year round. 

Take a look at the images of our beach on Trip Advisor.

Reef is a high end luxury property with only seven exclusive palatial suites set in three acres of tropical gardens with a 65 metre beach frontage.

And whilst we don’t offer karaoke we do offer a luxury private and intimate spa, yoga tuition, an all weather tennis court, table tennis, and romantic dinners on your private terrace, and private excursions none of which you chose to use.

Our attendant pool boy will ensure that your sun bed is facing in the right direction and your towel laid out without a crease, all appealing to the discerning traveller who is seeking total privacy and exclusivity. 

From your comments and from discussions relayed from our staff, perhaps you would have made a better choice by travelling in an organized group or package tour and staying at an all-inclusive property where compulsory entertainment would have been laid on for you.

What Reef is not is a home stay or house party where you will dine with and be entertained by the owners.

We have a staff of over 38 wonderful people who, together with our impeccable manager Malith Perera, will pamper and spoil you and ensure that your every need is catered for with their non-intrusive service. Our overflowing guest book with its highly complimentary comments and our repeat guests is testament to the success of Reef.

We frequently have requests for Reef on an exclusive basis and recently had one guest who booked Reef for exclusive use for over a month but beware, for this we do charge a premium. Most guests would relish having Reef all to themselves.  Our aim is quality not quantity at Reef. 

I glanced at your other comments and you complained about all the other lovely properties you stayed at and again you added nothing constructive or positive.

The villa is beautifully furnished and the grounds immaculate, but be aware that it isn't really a beach resort. There is a very dirty strip of beach in front with no facilities and a beach that's unsafe for bathing.

However we were shown to our room to be told that the toilet was constantly leaking (but not that the jacuzzi was broken) and that were we sure that we wanted to stay in it?  We were then offered an upgrade to another villa in the morning.

Throughout our three night stay we felt that we were being slotted into a very specific schedule for meals, and that the place was being run to suit the staff rather than the guests.  For instance we had to choose our evening meal when we chose our lunch, and on the one time we didn't we were rung several times in our villa about it.  The turn down service was also carried out before meals started - this was unbelievable at this price level, as it meant that we were disturbed every night when getting ready for dinner.  On one occassion I put ""Do not disturb"" on the door only to be told off by the housekeeping staff both that night and the following day.

This led to the Reef having a very odd atmosphere, as it felt as if the staff were in charge while the owners were absent.  The lack of management also meant that on occasion it took forty minutes to find a member of staff or get an answer on the room service number - and when successful it took over three quarters of an hour, and a personal visit by my husband to the kitchen, to get a small plate of sandwiches made in the afternoon.

Altough these may sound petty the website, and the correspondence prior to our arrival, coupled with the price, set our expectations high.  The things that were missing, and the inconsistent service, were the small things that spoil holidays.  Had we been able to sort some of these things out while we were there we would have.  However the owner was due to arrive the day after we did but never materialised, and although the staff spoke good English it was difficult to articulate these concerns when a manager wasn't obvious among them.","A beautiful place but they need to get the service right","2010-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r87918422-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

I actually asked that, as we were the only guests, could we please order what we would like and then have it prepared.  This was later discribed as complaining.

Any complaint we made regarding, for instance, the lack of hot water on 3 of our 5 nights, the sliced, stale white bread and golden syrup served up as honey for breakfast, was all noted and used as part of the abuse we recieved on departing.

They love the property they built, but paying guests should be seen and not heard! We would recommend that you check it out and only stay there after they sell the property. The owners suggested that no hotel in the world would possible want us as their guests! Our life has been spent in the service industry and we have had to spend most of our time working with owners and operators of hotels as well as with guests.","The Basil and Sybil Fawlty Experience","2009-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r23376213-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed and thoughtful review of your recent stay with us at Hilton Yala Resort. It was truly a pleasure meeting you, and I sincerely appreciate your candid feedback.

I regret that aspects of your experience, particularly regarding the all-inclusive offering, did not meet your expectations. Your concerns were completely understandable, and I appreciate the opportunity you gave us to address them during your stay. As you noted, we have since updated our website to ensure greater clarity in our offerings, and I truly value your insights in helping us improve.

On a more positive note, I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the exceptional quality of our villas, food, and safaris. It means a lot to know that you found the Premium Pool Villa to be one of the best suites you’ve stayed in and that your experience with Sam on safari was so enjoyable. I will personally share your kind words with Hashini, Vishmi, Shamal, and the rest of the team, who will be thrilled to know they made a positive impression.

Your feedback is invaluable, and we take it to heart as we continue refining our guest experience. It was a pleasure having you with us, and I truly hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future for an even more seamless and memorable stay. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly should you ever decide to return—I would be more than happy to personally assist with your arrangements.

Wishing you all the best and safe travels ahead.

Experience Yala with a daily safari and all-inclusive dining and free flow alcohol'. After checking in we were taken to our villa and advised that the free flow alcohol was only available during lunch and dinner service and did not include any items from the villa mini-bar which were all chargeable. We requested that this be checked as the room rate was extremely high (more than we payed at nearby Uga Chena Huts which was an incredible all inclusive stay). The staff member left our villa and called us about 10 minutes later reaffirming what she had told us earlier. 

We were in the foyer when General Manager Gitanjali approached us. We had a conversation regarding the advertised all inclusive rate and the restrictions we were now advised of (which were certainly not advertised anywhere), showing her the Yala Hilton website, and requested whether we could cancel our booking and return to Uga Chena Huts. Gitanjali was very understanding, checked the advertised rate on the website and listened to our concerns. She agreed that the website did not advise of any of the restrictions, and agreed that the alcohol menu from the all inclusive lunch and dinner service would be made available to us for the duration of our stay (by the main pool, pre and after dinner drinks etc).  Unfortunately this is an extremely limited menu that consists mainly of soft drinks, milkshakes and juices with a choice of one red or white wine and limited cocktail or spirits. 

On our last day we were informed that there were a number of mini-bar items available free of charge daily in our villa (beer and soft drink) that we were previously advised were all chargeable, this was disappointing. 

We experienced a number of ongoing service issues during the stay, where the all inclusive alcohol menu was refused, which required this issue to be unfortunately addressed a number of times each day. Fortunately it was resolved satisfactorily on each occasion with the assistance of Gitanjali or Front Office Manager Vino. We found both Gitanjali and Vino to be excellent; they were both friendly, intuitive and professional. 

The Hilton Yala Resort is one of the most luxurious and high quality resorts that we have stayed in anywhere in the world. The small number of suites and villas means that the large resort never fills too busy or overcrowded. The main pool is absolutely spectactular and one of the best resort pools you will come across. 

The food was of an exceptional quality and we had a number of great meals, with the chef happy to make variations for dietary requirements. The breakfast, lunch and dinner meals were all exceptional. The Hopper X Benny was the absolute standout breakfast meal! 

Service was exceptional and the staff at Hilton Yala Resort are well trained, we received amazing service from Hashini, Vishmi and Shamal during our meals. 

We did two safari drives with Sam the Ranger / Guide and they were great. The quality of vehicles and drivers used were excellent, Sam was very informative and passionate and made the experience very enjoyable. 

The Premium Pool Villa was exceptional! One of the best hotel suites that we have ever stayed in! Extremely spacious, well appointed and very modern with the latest technology and high class linen and fittings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen and towels of the highest quality. The pool was phenomenal and we spent loads of time in it. 

It it wasn't for the service issues and advertising issue regarding the all inclusive rate, this would have been easily a five star review and stay. Having to deal with this a number of times a day slightly ruined what would have otherwise been an incredible experience. The price Hilton charges for an all inclusive rate where alcohol is only served during lunch and dinner is not all inclusive and does not represent value when compared to nearby Uga Chena Huts or Wild Coast Tented Lodge which both have exceptional all inclusive offerings. 

I note after our stay, Hilton Yala Resort has corrected their website which now states 'Safari all inclusive. Experience Yala with a daily safari incl dining, free flow alcohol during meals.'","All Inclusive is NOT an All Inclusive rate with significant restrictions and availability","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1000202442-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed review of your stay with us. We're pleased to hear that you enjoyed your upgraded pool villa and appreciated the privacy, spaciousness, and amenities it provided. It's also wonderful to know that you found our team welcoming and the ambiance of our restaurant appealing.

We sincerely regret that the dining experience did not meet your expectations, especially the vegan options, and we appreciate your candid feedback. We'll review this with our culinary team to ensure improvements are made to better cater to all dietary preferences.

We understand the limitations you experienced with the setting of our property due to our proximity to the National Park. The safety and well-being of our guests, as well as the protection of wildlife, are paramount, which is why certain restrictions are in place. We apologize if this detracted from the enjoyment of your stay, and we recognize that this type of setting may not be ideal for all travelers.

We appreciate your valuable insights and will continue to work on enhancing the experience for our guests while balancing the unique environment we're situated in. Thank you again for choosing to stay with us, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future with an improved experience.

Because we are Hilton members, we were upgraded to a pool villa, which was a delightful, spacious suite with a small pool and very nice outside sitting area.  There were plenty of electrical outlets and USB ports.  While these villas don’t have a view, we were nicely screened from neighboring villas, so it felt very private.  This suite was one of the best we have ever seen.

There is a nice view from the restaurant, and it has a pleasant atmosphere.  The servers are pleasant and attentive.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food was disappointing.  Possibly they do better with the meat dishes, but the vegan food did not live up to the very high prices charged.  We had far better food for a 1/4 of the price at a local restaurant we found 20 minutes away by car. 

It is also important to know that the hotel is in the national park’s buffer zone.  It’s great to be so close to the park, but that does limit the ability to enjoy the setting.  Because of the wild animals, we were only allowed to visit the beach area during the scheduled 1-hour Ranger Walks at 5 am and 5 pm – and ocean swimming is not allowed.  After 6 pm, you cannot use the pool area and cannot walk between your room and the restaurant or spa; the hotel provides a buggy service instead.  You are not allowed to bring food to your room or eat in the sitting area outside your room.  

The pool has some nice sitting areas, but it is shallow and more of a wading pool than a swimming pool.  We didn’t use the pool or ever see anyone else using it.  

As already stated, the rooms here are great, and the grounds look beautiful.  Unfortunately, we didn’t enjoy ourselves as much as we expected.  The food was uninspired and overpriced.  We also felt trapped in our room because of the limitations on walking around and the lack of beach access.  After being visited by a large troop of aggressive monkeys, we didn’t even feel comfortable enjoying our outside plunge pool and seating area.  While it sounds romantic to be right on the ocean in a national park, and watching monkeys play is fun for awhile, the reality is that you can’t really enjoy the location.  If you tend to spend your hotel time inside, this may be a good choice for you.  Since we prefer to spend more time outside, it wasn’t a good choice for us.","Excellent rooms, but overall disappointing","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r972471880-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We sincerely apologize that certain aspects of your experience did not meet your expectations. We also appreciate your positive remarks about our rooms and the top-notch service provided by our staff.

I would like to clarify that our second restaurant is not closed due to low occupancy. Rather, we have decided to offer the same menu at our all-day dining restaurant due to the high temperature and humidity, ensuring a more comfortable dining experience for our guests.

Our pricing for activities such as safaris and bush walks reflects the unique and enriching experiences we provide. These activities are conducted by our FGASA-qualified rangers, who offer exceptional and informative journeys through the natural beauty of our surroundings. Numerous positive reviews attest to the value of these experiences.

Given our location within a national park, we are subject to restrictions on entertainment to preserve the natural environment and ensure the safety of our guests and wildlife. As your safety is our utmost priority, we accompany guests to the beach to ensure a secure and enjoyable visit.

We appreciate your understanding and thank you for your valuable feedback. Should you have any further concerns or questions, please feel free to reach out to us directly.

We know this as there is a biro mark I made on the day of arrival that is still on the bed. The cleaners carry a mop but no bucket and yesterday our room had a strong smell of urine after it had been cleaned. 

We asked twice for our room to be serviced however after returning from a trip 4 hours later it still hadn’t been. I went down to reception and complained following which it was serviced but we had the awful smell. 

We also had to ring three times, and wait 40 minutes before our laundry was collected.

The breakfast buffet is the same every morning with no variation which is Ok if you’re only here a day or two.

Pros: the breakfast buffet was excellent. The pool was very nice and had a fantastic view. Location was very convenient. 

Cons: most if not all rooms have views of the construction or buildings. Rooms felt dated and the bathroom layout was very weird. We were clearly being watched when in the pool from construction workers next door. There were several guests getting into the pool with their underwear. 

In contrast to Granbell the hotel felt dark and dated and the service staff were not memorable.","Decent hotel, but there are better choices in the vicinity","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d14106301-r965053039-Marino_Beach_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Rooms are fine and clean, however I paid extra for signature room plus with sun beds. Totally not worth it, the view is fine but the sun beds are terrible and not comfy. They could put at least some greens on the balcony to make it feel better. We were 2 + 1 and I paid for 2 + 1, but still towels were provided just for 2 of us. No extra bed for kid or whatsoever. 

The onsite restaurant seems to be overpriced, even for tourist place. Food quality is fine but also nothing really special - for sure not worth the money asked. 

The roof pool is great and provide fantastic view, but number of sun beds is very limited. Provided city bus tour is great and I highly recommend using it - it is free of charge and it goes to 5 places around Colombo and entire trip takes around 3 hours.   There is also bus going every hour to the beach side. Not tried it, but pictures looked great. 

As such, I recommend this hotel on arrival / departure from Sri Lanka as this is not far away from the airport (Transfer takes around 45 minutes, charged 50 USD for individual bus).  There is taxi offered, the price asked 1 USD per 2 kilometers. I recommend to get UBER and pay for tuc tuc as locals.

The name Marino Beach is a little misleading as you are not on a beach. It faces a road, railway track and rocks. It is a 10 minute drive to the one per hour shuttle. Our room was right at the end of a passage, floor 3. I think this was one of the  worst rooms here. We overlooked a construction site. The balcony was very exposed, all balconies in a row. I went outside and the balcony door locked behind me. Thankfully my husband was still in the room. No idea what we would have done otherwise. The adjacent shopping centre was unremarkable but worth a wander. 
The buffets - dinner and breakfast were both very good. We were one of the first for dinner, drinks order taken but not delivered until after our meal. A lot of the wait staff didn’t seem to know what to do…maybe more training?

Advantages:
Very friendly staff
Very clean hotel
Attached to a nice shopping mall that could provide some entertainment especially for kids
Rooms are spacious and modern
They have very nice jacuzzies at the roof

Disadvantages:

The hotel needs a facelift as it does not look as luxurious as the photos that hotel's management posted. I am comparing it to other hotel like Cinnamon, for example.
The breakfast is varied, but of not a very good quality especially the coffee and tea they are offering; the coffee they offer is made using a cheap machine.
The hotel is not a walking distance from the center of Colombo; you must take a tuk-tuk
The shuttle service they offer is very expensive

The plunge pool was located downstairs of the room, which lacks privacy as it is not covered and anyone walking by can have a peek at the pool. The plunge pool as many guests have complained was not pleasing and it required cleaning as well as IMMEDIATE maintenance. The pool requires heaters as the water is too cold to get in most of the time, so we could not use the pool. Even the main pool lacked cleanliness and required immediate cleaning. There was a mini fridge inside the room which was not cleaned for years I guess, it was a very old fridge and it had patches with required to be cleaned. We were given the option to use a boat ride to go to the Jetwing Lighthouse which was nearby for the buffet. However, the food at the Lighthouse was below standard.

The new chalets and the swimming pool are quite attractive but unfortunately many things were missing. With new establishments, the foresty feeling you get at this location has disappeared to a greater extent. 
On top of that, the service you get for the price you pay is way below the average. Would you expect an EMPTY MINI BAR with NO Wi-Fi in rooms, in a luxury property like this...? Especially for the price you pay...? Being a privileged member of the 'Aradhana' club, it's so disappointing to mention our experience at a Jetwing hotel in this manner....  However, the failures continued with NO HOT WATER until late night during our first day.
The menus are very limited here. They were better with more options during our previous stay. The food tasty and quality also not up to the standards. Once we complained the staff on POOR QUALITY OF FOOD with visible evidence on a dish served. Meal preparation time was over 1 hour on all occasions even for a Club Sandwich, other than the breakfast ordered previous night. However, thanks for larger portions offered. For meals, the in-house staff always encourage the guests to go to their sister hotel 'Light House' at our own cost, which is about 1Km away. They didn't even have cakes or cookies in-house for an evening tea. The chef had to rush to 'Lighthouse' to cater our need.  
The property seems like neglected by the management as there were just the chef and a service person during our 2 nights of stay, other than the person introduced himself as the 'Chief Butler' who was there for few hours on the day we arrived.
The Check-in & Check-out chaos remain the same from our previous visit as we were advised to go to 'Light House' hotel on both occasions. 
The courteous and flexible service offered by the helpful staff in these conditions should be appreciated. I still love this wonderful set of chalets hidden in a mangrove but the services and facilities issues must be addressed by the management without disappointing guests any further.
Highly recommended for couples. Families with kids, better avoid.","Relaxing Paradise let down by Poor Management","2017-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r521384473-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We took the complementary boat ride to Kurulubaddha which was a nice experience. My husband and I stayed 2 nights and while we found the service good and the staff pleasant we felt the hotel itself was rather a let down. 

First of all there are homes situated quite close to the villas and you can hear loud noises and people speaking/shouting which is quite a nuisance. The neighboring homes were burning garbage and we could smell the smoke from our room!!! Secondly our room AC sensor was disfunctional and we couldnt regulate the temperature. It was stuck at 20 degrees which was quite cold for us. Even though the staff tried to fix it we were told that the part needed to be replaced. To be fair they did offer us another villa on the second night but we were too lazy to move by then. The  villa was comfortable if a little under maintained. 

Having said that we must say the food served was well prepared and the staff very courteous and friendly. They took good care of us. 

So all in all this holiday wasnt quite what we hoped for which was disappointing since we had been looking forward to this since seening all the photos on the Jetwing site!

Finally was able to make it with my husband and boy was it a disappointment! We made the booking via the official hotel website. As the villas with the plunge pool were already booked on the 2nd day we opted to staying in the villa on our 1st day and the normal room on our 2nd day. Apart from the payment confirmation email received no other correspondence from the hotel. My husband and I drove straight to the hotel and noticed that the staff were surprised to see us ""drive"" straight to the location. They asked us if we went to jetwing lighthouse, we said no and the staff said generally check in happens at lighthouse and that after checking in the guests are brought to kurulubedda by boat. We were so upset and sad at hearing that we had missed such a lovely opportunity that I kept checking my email over and over wondering if I had missed a mail with all this info. Even checked back their website but no such thing is mentioned. I think the reservation team should do a better job of keeping their valued guests informed.
Apart from that the staff was very accommodating and checked us in with no fuss.
Villa with the pool was just like the pictures and so was the normal room. In Fact normal room was better than expected. 
Ambience of the hotel was ok and sadly had experienced all of their in-house crop to die off due to the hotel pool. Land area of the hotel is very small but the overall concept is good if only in a bigger area. Dinesh and the staff were lovely and the food was ok. Nothing much to do or see in the premises itself.
We were very excited by the plunge pool in the villa and couldn't wait to try it out. As it was located below the villa my husband took an extra precaution of locking our room while we were at the plunge pool. Once done with the pool and my husband tried to open the door the key broke inside the lock. It was such an instantaneous thing that we both were shocked. It was not like he had tried to unlock it with such force and my husband is not the Hulk! And the door was still locked. Now wondering what to do and cold and shivering after the pool we were able to get the attention of the staff to help us back to the room. Anyway it took awhile but we managed to get back in the room and the staff were very jovial about it.
Next day to check out we were told we need to head to Lighthouse. Upon closer inspection of the checkout receipt I noticed a clause called damages. And it mentioned a lost key. And they had charged 5000 LKR. Double the shock! I immediately knew this was due to our little incident and I was very upset. It was not like we purposely did something to the key! Not wanting to cause a scene I quietly paid my dues and left. Overall I am very unhappy and disappointed with my kurulubedda experience.","Disappointment","2016-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r365975634-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your review on Jetwing Kurulubedda, Galle. It is sad to know you had not enjoyed true nature’s experience at the Villa.

Being a property of only 06 villas, it gives us the opportunity of providing completely personalized service to all our Guests. Located amidst flora, fauna, mangroves and beside a river bank, Kurulubedda is an ideal get-away treat for those who wish to relax while enjoying their own privacy. Mosquitoes and bugs are unavoidable as such insects are found anywhere near rivers, mangroves etc. But we do provide necessary repellents ensuring that the guests have no hassle once the doors of the Villas are shut.

Going through your comments we understand that you had not liked the concept of Jetwing Kurulubedda and that your likes are more towards a hotel property with a variety of food outlets, public areas and a busy atmosphere. Do visit our sister hotel, the Jetwing Lighthouse the next time you plan on making a trip to the southern coasts of Sri Lanka. I am certain it will fit in to all your requirements. Until the next time, thank you of your patronage.

Ayubowan!

Thank you for your well descriptive review on Jetwing Kurulubedda, Galle. We are glad you had liked the concept of the Property and had enjoyed your stay with us.

The name of the Villa says it all. “Kurulubedda”, built in the midst of mangroves, is a perfect get-away ideal for those who wish to indulge in complete privacy and witness nature’s beauty that completely surrounds the property.

Your observations and suggestions have my full attention. Rest assured corrective measures will be taken accordingly. I would like to make this an opportunity to inform you that we have successfully completed the construction which was in progress during your stay at the Villa. And now, a more spacious “Kurulubedda” awaits your return. Until we meet again, thank you for your patronage.

The check-in at Jetwing Lighthouse was actually quite painless and turned out that Kurulubedda is only a 5 minute drive from the Lighthouse hotel. 
As described by earlier guests, parking is at your risk at a neighbour's house and the entrance is cluttered a little by construction work at present. However, it does not obstruct guests if they do watch where they step! We were ushered into Villa 2 which is a little away from the entrance by helpful staff and pretty must left to ourselves the whole time. 
The room is not very large but comfortable and make sure to use the nets supplied both in the room and on the deck. Take insect repellent but just be open to the fact that your in lush green surroundings which would obviously mean some insects like mosquitoes would be there. Personally we were not so bothered about it.
The bathrooms are spacious. We noticed however that the wooden sink area needed some maintenance as did some of the floorboards. 
Had a dip in the plunge pool which was a little cold and thought they could have thought about the little things such as some flowers or candle light by the ledge just to make it inviting. 
The close proximity to Galle town meant that we could take a short drive to the fort or Unawatuna any time we wished to. We travelled as a couple and would not recommend the property for very small kids given the deck is high up, stairways etc.
Did not have meals at this property,instead we opted for the breakfast buffet at the Lighthouse hotel.
We noticed that the construction would expand the property and they were also building the rooms to overlook paddy fields, no doubt it would be lovely when completed. You would probably need to re-look at expanding on parking options as well as the continuous upkeep of the property. Would recommend this if your a nature buff!","The perfect hideaway - some maintenance needed.","2015-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r313194262-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for the wonderful review following your stay at Jetwing Kurulubedda, Galle last October. We are glad to know your stay with us had been a lovely experience.

We did start constructions at the beginning of this year which we have by now successfully completed. Kurulubedda has been expanded from 02 Villas to 06 Villas with an addition of an in-house swimming pool for the guests. The expansion has given a new atmosphere with more space for all guests who visit to enjoy nature in its purest form to enjoy and relax better.

While thanking you for your encouraging feedback we make this an opportunity to invite you and your husband to visit us and enjoy yet another relaxed vacation with us.

We were really looking forward to the Kurulubedda experience and we paid good money for it. It was our first wedding anniversary and from the photos we saw on the Kurulubedda website we were intrigued by the set up.

The mangrove forest, the elevated wooden walkway, and individual splash pool with each hut, seemed and actually are a true plus for this property.

Only to discover after our arrival that one of the staff was a true privacy invader. The guy who is employed as a chef, acted as our personal bodyguard, luggage porter, and a 24 on 7 security officer with us.
 
He kept following us around. The minute we set foot out of the bedroom there was no way he could leave us alone to enjoy the surroundings. The cherry on the cake was when at one point he instructed us to go and have dinner at the Jetwing Lighthouse ""and then come back here!"". Is this Alcatraz? He pushed himself too much and at many points he would stop infront of us staring in our eyes waiting for that extra tip. 

Before going to dinner at the Lighthouse he told us that his shift was about to end. When asking whether he could provide us with a torch to find our way back, he put our mind to rest by saying that the security guard at the entrance of Kurulubedda will be ushering us back to our villa.
But to our astonishment when we arrived back close to 11pm he rushed to our aid. Not wearing the work uniform and smelling of alcohol he insisted with the other staff that he wanted to take us to our room. For the 4th time in a span of few hours he expected another tip.

We were supposed to spend 2 nights here but after a series of other mishaps we cancelled the last night. After complaing with the General Manager he offered a honeymoon suite at the Jetwing Lighthouse. The behaviour of the chef was promptly addressed and the worker came to apologise before our departure.

A few notes worth mentioning about the Kurulubedda.

1. There is no signage promoting this property. Our Sri Lankan guide/driver had to stop several times to finally find this place. The property does not even have a name plate on the facade.

2. We were shocked in finding that the cleaning upon our arrival was not done properly, at least in the bathroom. In one of the drawers in the wardrobe situated in the bathroom we found a black lacy underwear surrounded by a shower of gecko droppings. Showed the photos to the General Manager who apologised and pleaded us not to put the photos online. 

3. The Kurulubedda property consists of only  2 villas. No internet, despite being advertised on booking.com that internet was included. We were never given a proper explanation of how the Kurulubedda works. In reality, one can either have breakfast and dinner in this property or else go to the Jetwing Lighthouse and enjoy all the buffet services, pool area etc free of charge. Transport to and fro the 2 properties is also provided free of charge by the company.

4. Many mosquitos around at the Kurulubedda. This is to be expected considering that the property is right next to a river. So be prepared and take all necessary measures. Gladly bedrooms are properly sealed with adequate pvc sheets and nice curtains. But this detail is somehow missing from the bathroom. Insects, mosquitos and geckos are free to roam. And if you forget to close the bathroom door, embrace yourself to a mosquito invasion.

5. On the second day the airconditioning was not working, actually emitting heat in the soaring temperatures.  After this episode, we insisted that we wanted to move out and go to the Jetwing Lighthouse. The General Manager was very understanding and knowing all the background to the previous events, offered his apology and a quick solution. This is a true example of how customer relations work. Well done, and thanks for this.

All in all I strongly believe that Kurulubedda has the potential of a true lovely experience should the little obvious hurdles be addressed.","Unique place but TERRIBLE experience","2012-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r131804064-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Regarding the hot water - in the future we hope all rooms will have warm water. The beach and the entire country is a mess due to pollution. We have made it a point to be a zero plastic hotel - in fact going a step further and focusing on Sustainability as well.

The public places are beautiful, clean, and the stuff is incredible friendly! The food was healthy and delicious, the massages wonderful as well as the yoga classes in the deck facing the sunset.

The only con was that, even though I have paid a bit extra to have a private room, I got the ugliest room comparing to all my friends. I didn't even have a chair to put my clothes, and I was looking so forward to have an open air bathroom, which I didn't get, while all my friends did. This was the garden view room, which was directly connected to another room, so I had to share the porch with the neighbors, which was quite noisy if the neighbors stayed late. I asked twice to be changed to another room, and they promised that they would do that as soon as other guests would leave, however, they changed my neighbors but not me, which was very disappointing and I felt that they never cared about my requests.

Another con is that the room had cold water. It was very difficult and not so nice to have a shower in the morning or in the evening, as the water was quite chilly. Apparently, you need to book a superior room in order to have warm water.

And finally, the beach was extremely dirty. Bottles, plastic, fishing nets, ropes, dead fishes, clothes, etc decorated the beach in front of the hotel, which made me not wanting to touch the water at all. Pity as the water was nice, but the surroundings were not inviting at all.

However, all in all, I really liked my experience thanks to the wonderful staff, food and public places, but it was disappointing because of the dirty beach and the dark and ugly room received spite of my requests to be changed.","Nice, friendly hotel with good food, but with some issues","2018-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r566070802-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

We do offer something unique, homely and definitely not a posh 5 star setup. We do offer a rustic, family like experience.

In terms of the spot, we have Vella, Donkey, Puttalam, Kalpallady and the downwinder from Thalawila to KSL in the Summer. 

In Winter we have the flat water lagoon IN FRONT of KSL along with the beach. 

Either way depending on the season conditions change.

I don't like writing bad reviews but I look in TripAdvisor before booking my trip there and I wish someone would have told me all that.

I've been in other kitesurf camp and I wouldn't describe this one as a kite paradise. This is why:

- The lagoon isn't close to the camp. You have to do 10 minutes truck drive and there is only 1 trip on the morning, one to go and come back from lunch and one to go back to the camp at 5pm. That's mean it really feels like we have to respect a time table. You can also go there by tuck tuck but have to pay extra.

- The water of the lagoon isn't flat at all and very dark. The place is a bit crowed and it tends to get a bit boring to ride there if you are not learning or focusing on jumping. If you like flat and transparent blue water don't go there!

- The kitesurf trip proposed on the website don't really exist. Only Vela but it's only
2 days and 90€ per person. We asked for the day trips they proposed but everyone was giving us different answers and telling us wasn't really possible.

- The staff is nice but we, and other guests we talk to, felt a bit like if there we treating you more like friends than clients. The organization is quit messy and for the price we pay we can't feel than the staff is really there to please you. 

- We also felt than they were trying to get money from clients for as much things as they could and it didn't feel really nice.

- The food wasn't too good. Wasn't bad but nothing crazy. There is little choice and it feel like at school, they ring the bell and everybody
comes to serves themselves.

The good things:

- The camp itself is really nice. Very well taking care of and the bar as such a great atmosphere. It was probably the best part of the camp and the bar tenders were really nice. 

- The bungalow was nice, simple but clean and the bathroom was really beautiful.

- The downwind trip to Vela was really great.

90% of the people we met at the camp were from Europe so maybe the ""excellent"" reviews come from people who only kite there and haven't travel much because I think than if you compare that place with other ""kitesurf paradise"" it's pretty far from it. If you are in Sri Lanka for other things than kiting and just spend few days there it's ok but I wouldn't advise to come there to kite only during a week.","Overrated ","2017-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r522410446-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Sorry to hear about your experience. I am trying to understand why your weren't aware that we preferred cash payment, its on our very first e mail communication. Bank transfer fee is beyond our control, banking from Europe to Sri Lanka has a high fee, usually from the sending parties bank. 

I have no idea who you are still, maybe mail us?

We even do an estimate to make life easier for guest on request. 

Our trucks do leave on time each time and as much as we like all to go on the first round to the lagoon, we cannot delay 20 others because you got late. 

We do ofcourse arrange tuk tuk's to take you at any other times, or a downwinder to the kite lagoon is also possible :) 

Oh well, perhaps we cannot please all. Sorry your not one of them.

1. Food, point taken, Sri Lankan food infused for all lunch time meals since 1st week January onwards 2016.  We might have 2 Sri Lankan nights a week for dinner but on the rest have more options for Sri Lankan side dishes. 

2. Our main season is from May to October & Mid December to End February. For the rest its true that we dont have large sizes (Max we use is 14M, we are a bit spoilt that we dont go kiting in lighter conditions). On all e mails, if the are coming in a low season we mention about the kites and sizes we have - in fact we sometimes advice not to come in our low months if its just for kite. 

I think you use the old Core 17 - the only 17. Sorry if it was not in good shape. We didnt want to be unfair by charging you for repair :) We want you to enjoy Kitesurfing. Maybe for the next season we will buy a few more 17/19M.

3. Tents dont leak, we have a roof above them.

Thanks for taking time for the review.

KSL is rustic, its a functional, no frills place and certainly not a big concrete structure with air conditioning to keep the place cool. So yes, we probably didn't appeal to you too much as we didn't have the frills you expected. 

The majority of the guest do however love this concept hence the reviews. 

For those reading this review, we have many staff who earn a decent pay, get their pensions schemes sorted out by us, all taxes are paid, licenses to sell beers, community cared for. These all cost and our pricing takes into account all these things.

Our lagoon bungalow was simple (in the good way) and really nice. There is a lot of attention to the details everywhere. Big thanks to Tequiri who welcomed us very well and to Hamid who has been really nice during the kite instruction with my wife. 

Surprisingly the issues are on the kite lessons and the Beach staff. We maybe had bad luck on the period but the staff was not supportive. The other instructors and staff were looking at every drop of the wind to cancel the lessons and push people to go back to the camp. It was really really clear that they didn’t want to be there !! The beach boys were pushing everyone to go back at the hotel. When you travel there for few days, you don’t want to be lock in the hotel all your afternoon just because the staff and instructors wants their afternoon off. The small drops of the wind looked like the perfect excuse – we spent our week to negotiate with the staff to have a kite lesson (for my wife) and to stay on the lagoon (for me as a kiter). It is not normal, the light wind was the excuse but definitely not the reason. 
And the camp has a staff of “beach boys” supposed to help people during the lessons. They were on complete vacation and didn’t want to put a foot in the water. Number of beginners on the camp were really complaining on that attitude from the staff. You could not expect the boat or a rescue if the manager was not forcing them to go (and the manager was not always around unfortunately). They were just looking at the students dragged in the middle of the lagoon and doing desperate and useless signs to be rescued - but they were not moving at all …  

In conclusion, it is a very nice camp and we were just a disappointed by the laziness and careless of the staff on the beach (except rare exceptions as Hamid).

There are many many good things to say about this place but to be honest it just wasnt what we were looking for, let me start with the positives:
- Dil and his team are great.. the staff and polite, hardworking and attentive
- The resort area looked very beautiful, palm trees dotted around, thatched cabanas, pretty flowers everywhere etc.
- The dolphin trip we will remember FOREVER! Forget spotting 3-4 of them as with most so called 'dolphin trips' , we must have seen at least 500-600 of them leaping out of the water in their pods.. just wonderful
- Very family friendly
- Seems to be trying hard to be genuinely eco-friendly and low impact which is great to see
- We did a scuba diving course with Beatriz from the local 'Epic encounters' dive school and it was a fantastic experience 

BUT....... this resort will not give you a taste of the real Sri Lanka

- We were in Sri Lanka as backpackers; interested in meeting local people, tasting real local food and experiencing the different, unique and wonderful things Sri Lanka has to offer. After arriving we quickly realized that the other clientele we basically all Russian, British or Aussie and were mostly interested in meeting other westerners and drinking at the bar in the evenings... not to say theres anything wrong with that.. but its just not what we were in Sri Lanka to do! In fact we were in the country to get away from being surrounded by loud westerners! :) 
- We found the food not particularly inspiring - it is served as a buffet style, and it has to be said there wasnt a lot of choice for vegetarians (my girlfriend is a veggie and she was disappointed by the meals)  We were hoping for some spice and some local curry dishes, however we were frequently disappointed as it was often basic western fair... chips / chicken / spaghetti bolognaise etc... which we found very un-exciting!!!
Granted its not easy for them to keep everyone happy considering there were familys there with young kids that probably wouldnt have enjoyed the spicy local cuisine

In fact one of the most enjoyable experiences during our stay was riding bicycles up to the main road and eating in a tiny local Kottu Roti shack where we made friends with the lovely guys working there who were so happy and appreciative for us stopping by for dinner (which cost 400R for both of us... under €3)

Finally I have to say that in our opinion Kitesurfing Lanka does not represent particularly great value for money.. we spent 3 weeks in the country travelling to many places staying in many cabanas, small hotels, guesthouses etc. where you can expect to pay 2500R-6000R per night for a double room (about €20-40) , however at Kitesurfing Lanka we paid €35 EACH per night to stay in a TENT with a thin camper mat for a bed
We paid full board and admittedly that was partly our fault for not changing to a cheaper option but the fact is, for the price of one night staying in a tent you can stay in a reasonable guesthouse with a/c for 4-5 days in the rest of the country!

To conclude.. Kitesurfing Lanka is a good resort and Im sure will be great for many people (particularly families and middle aged couples) but if you are a young independent type traveler who wants a genuine sri lankan experience, you might want to think again","Great for some, may not work for all types of traveller","2015-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r255615709-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Leo and I are indeed Kitesurfers and really enjoy running the business. Being Kitesurfers (and I must add those who studied business and hospitality), we came up with the concept of KSL and our offering which we clearly have stated on our website and e mail correspondence.

PRICE
This is what I see is the area you felt was a big negative of your stay. For those who do not know the background, Prices/ Pictures are also stated on the website and in our e mail correspondence so there are no surprises to our guests. 

Based on your review about price, I would like to state the following; 

1. The price includes all meals (Full Board, unlimited food). Tea/ Coffee and distilled water are available around the clock and is also included in the price. Meal includes Soups, Salads, Meat Items, Desserts. Price has been communicated to you prior.
2. You would not have ever experience power failures/ power cuts as we have a huge generator to ensure that the KSL camp has electricity 24/7. Not sure if others have it like this.
3. Free Internet.
4. Free transport to the lagoon. We have given guests the flexibility that if they want to go/return earlier/later for whatever reason, they simply let us know and we will work something out.
5. Use of a beach hut complete with Chairs, Hammocks, Drinks. 
6. Safety boat and staff on the beach to assist the KSL guests.
7. The only school to have emergency gear - spinals boards etc 

For the meals, we infuse Sri Lankan food approximately 2 times a week for lunch and 2 times a week for dinner. We have a professional Chef and we like to mix the menus around. We cater to kiters from all over the world. Sorry the food was not as spicy as you wished, maybe next time we do a dish for you a bit more spicy - all you had to do was request or state on the booking form when we ask for meal preferences that you prefer spicy food. 

All in all, your feedback is taken positively and we will look into how we can improve our value proposition to you. 

Hope to see you again.

Cheers,

Dilsiri Welikala",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dutch Bay Road Kudawa Road, Kalpitiya 61360 Sri Lanka","Kalpitiya","Sri Lanka","61360",,"Dutch Bay Road","Kudawa Road","3335783","8.215762","Kalpitiya, North Western Province","79.71677","Kitesurfing Lanka | Resort","694","4.8","4","9","18","83","580","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1404719-d3335783-Reviews-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html","http://www.kitesurfinglanka.com","2014-08-16","OTHER","3",,"Cleanliness","3","Service","3","Sleep Quality","3",,,,,,,,,"My partner and I stayed here for three nights in a tent.  The first night in a tent was great but the novelty quickly wore out particularly based on the 70 Euro we were paying a night.  The food was good but there was no local dishes as we were told the guests didn't enjoy the local spicy food.  While we enjoyed our stay, we felt KSL had a hostel vibe targeted for the French that could have been anywhere in the world, you didn't feel like you were in Sri Lanka.  In addition KSL seemed to be run by the kite instructors and while the kiting facilities and activities were excellent, it was evident the actual running of the accommodation could be improved.  As for kiting the big lagoon is great for beginners as there is so much space however the wind can be quite gusty at times, the water is also brown so if you are looking for blue water you will need to pay for an island trip.
We moved to Kappalady Kitegarden after our stay here and much rather preferred our time at Kitegarden, although the kiting services provided at KSL were much better for beginners.

Pros
Nice facilities - hammocks and bean bags to relax
Excellent kiting facilities - kite repair shop
Good for beginners or those looking to learn to kite 

Cons
Shared bathroom for tents weren't great
Have to take a truck to the lagoon (morning and afternoon) so you are locked into a time if you want to kite.  You have the option to kite on the beach near KSL but you need to be experienced
Overpriced

Overall
While the facilities were great the actual accommodation was not worth the price.  If I had friends who needed to learn to kitesurf I would check in here for a few nights and do the island trip while they learnt.  Once they had the basics I would then be moving on to something that provided better value and freedom to kite","Kitesurfers trying to run a camp","2014-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r222308708-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Thanks for taking time to give a review. 

Few things to clear up; 

1. You arrived in February: The wind is perfect in the ocean which is right in front of our camp. You can simply walk out of the bungalow and kite :) . We are 15 minutes away from the flat water teaching lagoon - but we do provide free transport.

2. We will look into why our proposition didnt match your expectations. You have the website, prices, even a video presentation of our camp. We then have direct communication with you stating clearly the pricing and what to be expected. 

Sorry if you didnt sleep at night - I am sure it was a once off day where everyone in our camp wanted to socialize and got a bit loud. But your feedback is taken. 

Do come back and see the improvements yourself. If you are not happy this happy - I'd be more than happy to give you a refund :)

I agreed to half the lobster and was quite surprised when the dish came out, and it was the entire half of a lobster with three bites of tail meat. 99% shell. But they proceeded to charge me $55 for the entire lobster after insisting there was no way I could eat an entire lobster.  After only serving me half of it. I think it was a total scam.

We had been booked into a ‘Luxury’ category room, either twin beds or large king-sized. The web-site describes these rooms as being luxuriously appointed with balconies providing panoramic views and featuring writing desk and chair alongside photos of spacious rooms with beautiful soft furnishings. Our room was cramped, with two very short beds with thin, barracks style mattresses, a wardrobe, luggage table and small side table. Two very small windows looked over the car-park and were above the kitchen. Staff came and went until late at night and from early morning. Mini buses and cars started at 5:30am. What furniture and fittings there were, were broken, and tired. When we spoke to the duty manager, he  laughed (quite possibly with embarrassment) and suggested I complain to the hotel owners, not him - he gave me a complaints form. He did agree that the furniture was very poor, and in the case of a bedside lamp with exposed wires and gaffer tape, dangerous. No attempt was made to relocate us. We did spy other rooms, though open doors, and they were mostly as described on their website, although there are only 3 bedrooms with balconies - BE WARNED, if you want these, request ahead.
With the exception of the laughing manager, all the staff were extremely attentive and efficient. The food was very well prepared and imaginative - we were on HB and the four course menu offered an appetiser, a soup and two or three choices for the mains and desert. The a la carte menu had the usual international ‘light’ lunch fare and snacks - again, well cooked and presented. Breakfast is prepared to order and includes fresh juices, fresh fruit and an excellent assortment of cooked egg or ‘local’ SriLankan dishes.
Superb gardens and a lovely pool area are well tended and offer amazing views of the tea plantations and surrounding hills. It is well worth taking a hike for a few hours, through the adjacent estates.","Beautiful Location, Dreadful Room","2019-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r647146336-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Lovely looking hotel and beautiful setting/location but way out of its league as a 5 star property and as a ‘Small Luxury Hotel of the world’.

The main issue here was service....or lack of it. The staff aren’t trained and a number of mishaps occurred regularly. Lunch we waited nearly an hour and a half with only one other table present. Prior to lunch though we had to hunt someone down as they were non existent. They were removing entree plates and bringing out mains while others were still eating their entrees. Some of the mains weren’t as described on the menu (the same lunch/dinner menu for three days). Speaking of menus, the staff would knock on our door (or sometimes during breakfast) asking us to place our orders for dinner.....very inconvenient). The wine was non-existent. They had a total of ten bottles of white wine and slightly more red for the entire hotel. A wine delivery was supposed to be made but it never arrived. When we did order wine which came from the small wine fridge 15m away....it took forever. As the staff knew nothing about the wine, multiple times we had to inspect the wine fridge ourselves.

Other issues were the hotel itself is below standard. A pair of thongs/flip flops sat outside our room door for the entire stay. No iron/ironing board in the room. A weirdly placed fireplace in the lounge which on the back was stuffed with toilet rolls (safety risk when on?).

The bedroom was quite small which wasn’t a big deal but room 203 is on the front corner meaning you hear every guest arrive & depart at all hours. There were always five cars & vans parked down the side of the building under our bedroom window so it sounded like they were in our room. Not to mention the people associated with those vehicles standing outside chatting day & night. We could also hear all of the staff carrying on from their staff quarters down the drive. We also had to endure the clanging of pots & pans from the kitchen while cleaning every night. There’s also no air con.

Spending most of our time by the pool, staff asked once if we wanted a drink which we did. They never came back on any occasion and glasses/bottles sat there for 3-4 hours without being collected. In fact at times we brought it to them ourselves. If we wanted another drink we had to go & find someone.

The bathroom was dated & had no block out curtain meaning we had to hang a towel so the people loitering around outside didn’t get a show. Shower tiles were chipped and a strange blue liquid leaked down the shower wall.

When we wanted to speak with the manager we couldn’t as they were on holidays with no assistant manager to replace. We ended up contacting our tour company to follow up all the issues.

This is a lovely hotel in a beautiful spot but it needs to be reduced to 4 star & have its ‘Small Luxury Hotels of the World’ endorsement removed....& that is something we’ve already passed on.

The staff are lovely but just don’t have any training and that is the fault of Amaya and the manager of the property. Having stayed in a number of hotels/resorts before & after Langdale on this trip it is incredibly evident that Langdale Amaya falls way behind.","Very Disappointing","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r561880600-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Hotel charges are highly overrated by the company by having a ""regular room rate"" closer to Rs 40,000.00 a night. This is an old house converted to a hotel and added a spa. Certainly no comparison to a place like the Heritance Tea Factory that's close by which is a 5 star ⭐️ hotel and their regular room rate is the same. 
Of course travels are getting smarter so Booking.com Rate was around Rs 19,000.00 with taxes and they do offer local credit card promotions with about 50% off. I think room only or B&B needs to be around Rs 10,000.00 for a place like this max. 

The Good:
Very motivated staff willing to do what ever it takes to take care of the guest. We checked in late and the resident manager Imalka Thilakaratne was fantastic. She was very professional and clearly had the attitude to win customers for life. She never forgot to invite us back to the hotel and give her card asking us to call her if we needed help during our travels. 
- Beautiful garden around the hotel premises. Consistently we observed very hard working staff who was quick to greet us but to go back to the task that they were doing. 
- food was just right. From Bfast to lunch it was a right selection and the right amount of spices for our liking 
- servers were very kind/ accommodating.
- Location is very private and you don't see any of the small houses (at least not from our room as we were at the back of the building)

The bad. 
- Distance from the main city. A good 30 mins drive and not too much to do around the hotel. 
-  small rooms
- small bathroom. (shower Cubical was leaking in our bathroom)
- absolutely no place to keep your toiletry bag other than on the floor. 
- Rooms are not sound proof. You can hear people walking outside as well as inside the building 

Overall a at the right price certainly a good place to recommend. 

Thanks Imalka for going above and beyond!!!

Not difficult to locate the hotel. Its in the small luxury hotel category and i wonder why? before going to the hotel i expected a lot and now i wonder why its in the luxury category. 
Hotel only has 13 rooms so that qualifies for the small but luxury thats a question mark. 
I expected the area to be very cold but climate change is happening every where we had to switch on the fan to sleep and we had a swim in the pool as well. there is not much chairs outside to sit. only two places. if two families take those chairs under the umbrellas then no one else can't stay outside. 

even the dining area is small, at once if all the guests come to dine then there is no place to sit. the day we stayed they had BBQ and it was kept outside. In the night its bit cold. All the food were cold and in the dark you cannot find what the food is. they have not kept name tags so i had to ask the chef what the dish is. 

the bar is so small and absolutely no place to sit as they have kept a pool table in the middle. so you cannot enjoy a drink in side. right next to the bar there are two rooms and good that people do not go to the bar if not its such disturbance to the guests in the those rooms.

The two triples were not bedded up with an extra bed, though, so we had to send the staff for two extra beds. Initially, three of us in a triple room was given a small suite in another part of the hotel than the others, but upon learning that the single occupant in the group was given a larger room, we requested a switch. In the end, we all ended up in the same wing, begging the question of why we weren't just placed there in the first place? The hotel has 13 rooms, about as many on staff and was only half full, so they weren't exactly overworked...

After unpacking, we went straight to the restaurant and ordered our meals. Despite being the only ones in the restaurant (again, with a staff of 4-5 waiters), the first meals - pasta bolognese for the kids - arrived after 45 minutes. The rest of the meals arrived one by one, with the last one - lobster and fish - arriving an hour and a half after placing the order! Ridiculous! By then, grandmom, who had ordered it, had gone to bed, fuming. At least they didn't charge us for it, but despite us telling them not to, they took the meal to her room, which only infuriated her even more.
As for the food itself, the bolognese and cottage pie were rather bland, but the rest of the food was fine without being world class. Pricey, though...

A tip to the hotel manager/staff: Most people do NOT like having a waiter standing right behind your back during the entire stay at the restaurant. A waiter can be attentive without being intrusive.

A second tip for the manager/staff: After having given us the menu cards, give us more than (literally!) five seconds to decide what we want.

A third tip for the manager/staff: Don't automatically serve 4-6 cakes to each guest at breakfast. No one is going to eat all of them, if they even like them. Such a waste!

Anyway, the rooms were fine, if a tad run down. This was easily the most expensive stay during our Sri Lanka trip, and one can't help wondering why they can't afford a handyman with a screwdriver to fasten loose fittings and a washcloth to wipe off mold from the windows?

Speaking of price vs. quality; of all the hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, the staff at this one were the least fluent in English. Some of them litterally didn't speak a word, and had to fetch the most fluent in the bunch every time. A great source of potential disasters...!

The best parts of the hotel were the absolutely stunning views and the gardens (if one can overlook the horse statue, which looks like an oversize clay figure from kindergarten). A big thumbs up to the gardeners; they've really managed to bring an immaculate English garden to life in the Sri Lankan hills! As for the rest of the staff; it's not that they are rude or unfriendly or lazy - quite the opposite! It's just that they are rather incompetent...

In the end, the stay is not worth the price.","Posh Fawlty Towers","2017-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r462841399-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Unfortunately this hotel is hugely let down by its dinner service which , on the two nights we were there, was dreadful although the hotel was not full. You are asked to pre-select you food choices but despite this we were waiting over 1hr for our starters and also had a long wait for main and desert courses. The food when it eventually arrived was very good quality but by then your appetite has been spoiled. Other guests gave up completely and went to bed. The menu is very eclectic and in my view should be revised to better reflect local produce ( does anyone really want smoked salmon in Sri Lanka?) and possibly be easier to manage for the chef.

It's very peaceful and has fabulous views. But that's really the only good thing about it. It is certainly not 5-star - not even 4. 

Our room was cramped and the bathroom very dated. There really wasn't anything special or charming about it. 

There were so many things that could be improved to make the experience better: 

1. Communication
Reception staff were helpful but wouldn't go the extra mile. For example they advised that breakfast packs could be organized for our morning hike, but that we needed to call the kitchen from our room to order them. This resulted in misunderstanding ad the kitchen staffs English skills were limited. Would have been better if reception requested the packs. 
We also tried to visit the spa a few times but there was no one there and no number for them in the room. 

2. Refresh 
Bathrooms need updating. 
Towels are like cardboard
There is a nice lawn tennis court but only 1 very old, flat tennis ball so playing wasn't enjoyable. 

3. Breakfast
The best luxury hotels offer a simple, well presented, cold buffet of cereals, fruit and pastries plus an option of a hot dish such as eggs, pancakes, and a traditional option.  This would improve the experience and save so much wasted food that it provided to the table and not eaten. 

Overall our stay was average but we certainly see the potential in the property.

We stayed here for 02 nights during July'16. Its a small hotel with 19 rooms. We booked a Luxury deluxe room and the room was very spacious with good views, the only drawback is the room doesn't have a balcony.
The property is very well maintained and also the amenities provided were of good quality.
The only drawback at this place was service. they don't have enough people to handle the guests thought the hotel was not fully occupied.
No buffets during the breakfast and dinner. Our stay was on half board basis, for which they had a set menu for dinner.
The hotel staff requested us to order our dinner from the set menu, which had 04 options in the main course and we ordered our dinner well in advance(02 hours before) and when we arrived the dining place, they made us to wait for another one hour, which is not acceptable.

We are glad to hear you were well looked after by the team and enjoyed our 43 saltwater infinity pool and your stay in the Superior Deluxe Suite.

The current situation with the beach in front of our property is very unusual, and the change can happen unexpectedly and within a very short time period. It is a reflection of the extraordinary weather events that are occurring globally - and is beyond our control.  We are sorry on this occasion it was unusually different and hope it goes back to normal soon. As a result of your feedback we have come up with a temporary solution for our guests to continue to access the beach.

And we are so pleased to add - one day after we received your review, the beach has come back! That's how quickly the situation can change here. We wish we could add a photo to show you ... 

We are happy all other aspects of your stay were great and look forward to welcoming you back to Sri Sharavi for another stay soon.

The ocean front location and beach looked fantastic.

Through our travel agent we booked an Ocean deluxe suite that was not cheap ( probably £350/ 400 per night) we thought opening the doors in the morning and walking out onto the ocean facing balcony would be fantastic.

When we checked in we were shown to our suite, it was a fantastic room with vaulted ceiling and a full length wall of glass looking out to a rooftop garden and a small set of doors with a view of the ocean between 2 buildings.

When we checked with Kenny the manager to make sure we had the correct room it was , a deluxe suite has a partial sea view.  ( my fault I should have double checked before booking)

Still shell shocked from that and after unpacking we decided to go down to the beach and have a drink and relax.

We got to the bar ordered a drink and then walked to the beach and almost fell off the 12 foot high retaining wall and onto the rocks where the beach used to be.

THE BEACH HAS GONE, washed away, thousands of tonnes of sand has gone.

When I asked Kenny about the beach he shrugged his shoulders and said it used to be there but had been washed away but hopefully it will be washed back again, I said he needs an engineering project like the Jumeirah Palm to get the beach back.

We stayed here for 7 days, all the staff are great and very helpful. The 45 metre infinity pool was beautiful. The suite we had was lovely.

I could not fault the hotel nor its staff except that it is vastly overpriced (  + they add 10% service 18% VAT& 2.5% ) 30.5% to every thing, but to sell yourself as a beach resort you really do need to have a beach","Not a beach resort","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d6958701-r990761260-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to write a review.   I am glad that overall you enjoyed the stay, yet there are some areas that we can improve on.  We as the owners take your suggestions seriously and have worked to make changes.  

For example, we have put in a ladder now so that it is easier to get to the beach.  If I may explain, our property is located on the section of the island that is turning and the ocean that you see in front of you, the next landmass is the south pole.  With the changing environment, we are seeing unpredictable conditions with the sea. The beach can change from day to day.  The cinnamon fence was put in place as a request from the tourist police and the health authorities during the time of Covid which we are working on removing. 

The last two years have been challenging.  We as the owners along with Lenora are working with the team tirelessly to manage the service.  We have gone through each of your details and made sure the staff are made aware of the highlighted points.  At Sri Sharavi our front of house team which includes the house butlers and waiters job rotate between housekeeping and serving our guests.

Again thank you for the feedback, it helps us to improve.

Disliked · I tried to find solitude and tranquility from the city. From the photos it looked like the same place. How surprised I was when I found a GIANT CONCRETE SKELETON of a HOTEL right in your face! Construction cranes are sticking out, work is going on, you can see it from anywhere in the hotel. Step out onto the balcony of your $600 room, you have the ocean in front of you, and a giant construction site on your right, enjoy. Sunset happens right behind this construction site. This is not the hotel's fault, but none of the reviews or photos show this. It is very sad.

The second huge minus is that the ocean destroyed the beach that you see in all the photos. The hotel ends with a fence. Do you think the hotel provided a descent to the sand below, put a ladder? No, guests who pay $600 for a room crawl, clinging to a protruding wire and jumping from a height of more than a meter. It should not be.

Third, we accidentally left a silver Tiffany bracelet in the pocket of our bathrobe, which we took to the laundry. The bracelet is gone! Nobody could find it, and it's in a hotel for $600! I don't think this is allowed.

Extremely unstable level of service and staff. They constantly covered us with a crumpled tablecloth, without even trying to smooth it out. Sometimes completely untrained guys with no experience appear in the role of waiters. They brought ice coffee, slapping a ball of ice cream into hot coffee and not putting ice (imagine). Yesterday an employee could clean the room, and today he suddenly (for himself) turns out to be a waiter (do you think he will understand the menu?).

During the day, finding someone in the pool area is an unrealistic task, everyone disappears and goes about their business.

If you want to use the toilet - every time you will go to your villa on the second floor. It seems a trifle, but terribly uncomfortable on the fifth day.

The hotel organized a surf lesson - it turned out that the instructor would be an ordinary tuk-tuk driver, you can i","MISLEADING photo and description - no beach (all the january) and construction site nearby =(","2022-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d6958701-r827884272-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",
"2","664914894","en","6958701",,"General Manager","665160914","en","2019-04-09","SriSharavi","Thank you for taking the time to leave a review and to bring to my attention your concerns. 

I recall greeting you when you arrived and introducing you to our Reservations Manager whom took over the check in process and showed you to your room. My apologies if you found my manner too businesslike. It was certainly not my intention nor the usual feedback I receive from our many guests. I was away from the villa throughout the duration of our stay here, which would explain why you did not see me again. Our office, however, was staffed.

Regarding your AC and wifi complaint,  I have spoken with the Reservations Manager whom checked you in and he was on duty throughout your stay. He said that you did not bring any internet or AC issues to his attention.   The property was full during your stay and the other guests, both in your villa and the other villas, did not complain about internet.   The room you stayed in had guests both before and after your stay and none of them complained about wifi service.  Sometimes there is an issue for guests with their mobile phones, rather than the wifi being the problem it is the internal hardware of the guest's phone that creates the issue.   Had you informed the front office someone most definitely would have looked into it for you.   Similarly regarding the AC, we have an electrician on staff and had he been alerted that you  wanted the swing direction and the temperature of the AC changed, he could have assisted you.   And as you pointed out, there were many staff available for you to raise the issues with, staff whom you also pointed out were asking if your stay was comfortable.
 
Regarding the villa layout, the common space is shared the same way that common space is shared in a hotel, only you need share it with two other rooms rather than all 14 rooms. There is an option to book the entire 3 bedroom villa and have exclusive use of the villa. As you were only 2 guests you chose the common sense route of booking one of our Suite rooms within the villa. The Suite is very spacious and has its own a daybed and a sofa and chair, plus a very large balcony with 2 sunbeds and a dining table and two chairs. Our booking.com and website description makes it very clear that the Ocean Signature Suite is a room and not the entire 3 bedroom villa. 

Regarding our breakfast, I respectfully take exception to your claim that the selection is poor and basic. There is a choice of 3 different types of Sri Lankan breakfast and 4 different types of Western style breakfast each day.  Each breakfast is accompanied by a daily fresh juice and a fresh fruit plate of 3 -4 different types of fruit.  A guest is always welcome to ask for additional fruit or for a different juice. 

Regarding your claim that our food prices are 3-4 times higher than elsewhere, I also respectfully disagree as that is simply not the case.  With respect to our portion size, our Chef monitors the situation and I can report that the majority of plates are returned to the kitchen empty, meaning that the guest has enjoyed the full meal.   

Your criticisms regarding the staff are not a usual criticism we receive.  Generally our staff are complimented for being friendly and professional, but your criticisms are noted and I shall address them with the staff.

General Manager at the reception (western woman) was not welcoming and friendly when we arrived. She meant business and was extremely cold! Zero smile, zero questions like: how are you? How long have you been around? How do you like island? First time in SL? Nothing! That didn't give us a good feeling. She's never been around when we wanted to discuss couple of issues like: poor internet connection, AC issues, lack of ""do not disturb sign in the rooms"", staff walking into the room without knocking! And Staff were walking around like it was their place. Don’t get me wrong but I’ve paid 370$/night for ocean view suit thinking we will have a bit of privacy….

ROOMS: There are only 12 rooms at this property. At some point, I’ve had a feeling there were more staff than customers. We were told that we will have two floor villa with the private living room (as you see on the property website). But nobody has mentioned that the living room is shared between 3 rooms!!!!!!!!!! So, you only get your room and the rest is shared with other guests and staff (which were hanging out there none stop! I don’t exaggerate but every time we were passing by staff were in the living room or kitchen trying to engage in the conversation!)

There was a serious issue with the AC (basically it’s right above your blowing ice cold air on your head), Internet reception in our villa was very poor. We only had reception in one corner of the room.

Staff were nice but OVER-POLITE! Every day I was approached minimum 20 times with the same question: ma’am how do you like your room? Everything ok in the room? Where you from ma’am?  And it always was the same set of questions, like a broken record.

HOTEL RESTAURANT Breakfast selection is very poor and basic (probably that’s why its included in the price) Juices were water down and fruit salads tiny (fruits cost almost nothing in Sri Lanka) Dinner or lunch is served either by the pool or your private room. Food price is 3-4 times more expensive than any other place in the area. I’ve tried fried rice, noodle, salads and soups. Portions were insanely huge! This didn’t even look elegant on the plate! Seriously you could easily feed 3 ppl with one portion

"1","619123886","en","6958701",,"General Manager","619334148","en","2018-09-24","SriSharavi","It is with dismay that I read your review from your visit here 5 months ago.

Regarding the design of your room I must respectfully disagree with you .  The room is filled with natural light during the day.  In the evening there are 6 ceiling lights plus a direct light on the dressing mirror.  The room is also designed so that guests may enjoy to the fullest extent possible being right on the beach.  The large bi-fold glass doors open onto a very spacious balcony.  An almost constant ocean breeze blows through the property and the open air rooms.  The AC unit is 25,000 BTUs and is more than adequate for the room of its proportion.   Guests, upon check in, are given the option of choosing to keep their large balcony doors closed during the day with the AC unit turned on, but I can say with confidence that the great majority of our guests insist on their doors open so that they can enjoy the breathtaking view, ocean breeze and sound of the waves. 

I have interviewed the on duty staff regarding your service complaint, as well as reviewed our housekeeping logs.  I have satisfied myself that your room was properly serviced each morning and each afternoon of your two night stay.  The service included  providing your room with two litres of fresh filtered drinking water in the morning and in the late afternoon.  The staff do recall your displeasure after your request for a green coconut to be cut off one of our trees for your consumption was denied.   The king coconuts that we give to guests for drinking are harvested from our farm property, so perhaps there was some miscommunication from the staff member as there is always ample drinking water as well as fresh king coconut water.

Regarding breakfast, I again must respectfully take issue with your assertion.  Our breakfast Menu suggests 3 different styles of breakfast – from the Sri Lankan breakfast there is a choice of 3 different mains and 3 different kinds of curries; from the Western breakfast there is a choice of having your eggs cooked 5 different ways and the eggs are served with potatoes, bacon or sausage and tomato/cucumber slices; and, from the Continental breakfast the choice is the standard continental fare of pancakes, toast or French toast plus curd and treacle.  All of our breakfasts include a fresh juice, a fresh fruit plate and coffee or tea.  The Extras Menu is for those persons with a very hearty morning appetite desiring more.

They also had Alcohol license troubles when we visited so Alcohol wasn't served on the property. 
The stay wasn't bad but it wasn't luxurious either but the Service in the hotel is pathetic and One afternoon we faced trouble in fetching fresh water in the room. Also, the breakfast includes only limited options and for the extras, you have to pay this is a big turn off since in Srilanka food is relatively cheaper. 
The common areas are stunning but again due to bad service, we didn't enjoy it.

I have taken the opportunity to review your guest bill as well as our CCTV footage from our restaurant.  And while it may have felt like over 1 hour for your food to arrive, as you had been up early for a 6 am whale watching tour, the wait was less than that.  You were seated at 10 am and left the restaurant at 11 a.m. after having eaten your meal.  What was unusual was that our kitchen was still serving breakfast to the other 4 tables at the restaurant when you arrived. Our breakfast hours are 7 - 10:30 am and our lunch hours start at 11:30 a.m.  Your order was for 4 lunch items, two of which required the deep fryer.  In an effort to meet our guests' needs we accommodated your order.  Certainly it should have been explained to you that the wait for your food would take longer than usual as the kitchen needed to prepare itself for lunch orders.   Regarding your service criticism, your point is well taken and I have reviewed the CCTV footage and proper guest service with the staff to ensure exemplary service going forward.  Again, I thank you for bringing this to my attention and I am glad that you otherwise enjoyed Sri Sharavi and the local dogs.

Regarding the room, you booked our entry level room.  The room size and photos are available for guests to view prior to booking.  At your check in our Assistant Manager offered you an upgrade at a discounted rate, but you preferred to stay in the room you booked.  The room does have a balcony, with a view out over our Villa courtyard, but not a sea view.
While I accept your criticism of your dining experience and our staff courtesy, I can say that the staff and I were surprised to hear of both.  You were given the courtesy each morning of a late breakfast, past the 10:30 a.m. cut off time.  The staff made sure to advise the kitchen that your wife has a food intolerance to both spice and to gluten, once you shared that information with them.  Requisite food accommodations were made for your wife then.  Your two beef tenderloin meals were consumed and I understand that when asked if you enjoyed your meals, that you answered in the affirmative.      
And while I was not on the property during your 2 night stay, both our Operations Manager and our Assistant Manager were present from 6 am - 11 pm.  We strive to maintain the balance of being ""all seeing"" with also giving our guests a relaxed ambiance.

Room: 201, old toilets, smell of old rooms in a tropical country, but all in all it is fine.
Garden: nice with a very small swimming pool.
Staff: the doctor for ayurveda was always available and listening. The massage staff was extremely competent and nice and warm. The cooking staff was also extremely nice and tried the best to accomodate. 
One manager was trying to help us with the wifi and found a solution as soon as he knew about the problem. 
The second manager mostly smiled all the time but complained about my behaviour to the travel agency in Europe without telling me directly what the problem was. I was craving coffee even if it seemed not recommended by ayurveda treatment. I explicitly asked the doctor after 5 days to be able to have one coffee in the morning and the doctor agreed. I then bought an instant coffee and put it close to the tea bar. This was reported as a disturbing behaviour to the guests and structure of the hotel to the travel agency. This was extremely annoying and dishonest as I was a quiet guest even though i explicitly did not want certain treatment and explained the reason. This reporting did break the trust between me and this manager. 
This leads to the worse part of the resort: 
I could not blame the staff but I believe the owner of the hotel tried to save money with the food. First was the portion of the meals, extremely small and this probably suit fat people who come to diet. secondly, until i complained a bit, the food was mediocre and even fruits bought and served were sometimes not fresh. Given the price of fruits and food in this wonderful country, it s a scandal to have such small, boring meals during two weeks. I have come to realize that this had nothing to do with ayurveda or diet, simply the owner saved money by giving the staff instructions to cook that few. 
I could not blame the staff because it was not tbeir fault.

Difficult to recommend or not recommend the resort. Each person has his own taste. I was not convinced about the treatments. 
I like the staff but do not really care about interacting with other guests. Should i ? I dont think so, i was not in a boot camp or religious sect. But it seems like it is the style of the resort to have everyone living together like a family. Simply not my style, i said hi and smiled but had nothing to share with other guests. I guess if you mix and mingle then it s the place for you.","Average hotel with great location and great staff","2019-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d11869487-r657644829-The_Garden_Beach_Ayurveda_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The pool area suffered from an extraordinary design where the access was from inside the complex so you couldn’t lie in the gardens and just dip in 

However after a few days we appreciated the clean well appointed room , the gardens and loved the architectural tour of the hotel ( excellent) . The staff were all willing to help.

That means 3 huge buffet restaurants all joined and one lovely seafood which was amazing one cafe . Dress code at night was never adhered too by the mostly Russian clientele. We did complain about that but the staff had trouble policing this . The breakfast buffet is very good . There seemed to be a lack of direction for the staff in general.

   I will start with the Good. The hotel architecture is breathtaking and to die for,  The sea food buffet was the best with ample amounts of fresh seafood for all 3 meals... The entertainment on weekends was great and wonderful to watch... Beach great. 
Coming to the negative-
       1. At the Check in, they asked for our ID and then few moments later asked if we had given it and could not locate it... at the end, sanity prevailed and they found it... the Check in Staff also mentioned they only handle 1 Check in at a time. And it was taking then forever. This maybe due to to the Reception and Check in Staff being very inexperienced and unable to handle their job properly. At this hotel, they were seriously under staffed as well, which is unacceptable for such an Amazing 5 star hotel. Please either employ experienced staff ,or else give the necessary training and shadowing they need to deliver the high paying Guest  what they came for.
      2. No welcome drink and towel was  given until it was reminded,  it was shocking for a so called 5 star hotel to miss these finer points, when lower star hotels do so much more...
      3. On the website we booked a Deluxe Sea view room,  but upon arrival were informed that direct sea view is not promised and there would be trees obstructing the view.. Therefore, we asked them to edit the website instead of deceiving the paying guests...
      4. It has 3 beautiful pools but the chemicals used were far too strong causing guests to see double, by evening...
         It is a beautiful hotel by far, but the management should look into all of the above in order to fulfill a truly 5 star worthy experience, as it is not a budget hotel, but instead I believe the highest luxury hotel in their chain,  and as we have visited many Cinnamon hotels, this is an honest review in order for improvement...","Room for improvement...","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r967172150-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

The pools and grounds are lovely and loungers and towels are provided there and on the beach. Restaurant buffets for evening and breakfast provided a big selection of local and international food. Convenient for local town and restaurants.
Downsides were that there were corporate and private events taking place during our stay which meant some noise and the restaurant staff seemed to focus on those guests while disregarding those not part of that. At one breakfast when the corporate group departed the restaurant suddenly had absolutely no waiting staff, they just disappeared. A dinner service was due to end at 22.00 but we had our bill for signature shoved in front of us at 21.15 without asking because staff clearly wanted to clear for breakfast.","Beautiful resort hotel but not as good as it thinks","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r949591620-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

That said there are plenty of extremely reasonably priced restaurants nearby, with ample tuk tuk taxis just outside the door to take you there. The only downside to Bentota beach is that most hotels do not have sunbeds on the beach. (You can rent them from locals at a cost of 2500rupees/day for 2 plus an umbrella) The Cinnamon does have. but not enough, although they say they are expecting delivery of more. Unfortunately those they do have they allow to be saved by guests even if they don’t sit on them all day!

So a huge thanks to Hiroshana. But the beach was absolutely beautiful. So long that it never felt crowded. But again there was an issue that there were only 20 sun beds for a hotel with 159 rooms.

Air conditioning was tricky to adjust. The hotel covers a vast area so if you are unlucky enough to be allocated a room at the far end, it is quite a walk to the restaurants and other facilities. Being elderly and not terribly mobile, the long walks in the heat was something to dread each day! The majority of the hotel is open to the elements, so it is uncomfortably hot. I pity the poor staff on reception who have to stand for hours in that heat. The restaurant can only be described as chaotic, both at breakfast and dinner. We very rarely sat at a table that had full table settings, so we were forever asking for cutlery, napkins, glasses, condiments, etc. - which would take ages to get, and often only one at a time! So we had to resort to scavenging from other tables!! The food, while good, often ran out and was not replenished immediately. And I was shocked to see that the chefs  at the egg station were not wearing gloves - and I actually saw one of the cooks dip his finger into an egg mix to retrieve a piece of shell. Not very hygienic. I think I was more disappointed because the previous week we had stayed at the Habarana Village by Cinnamon and everything ran like clockwork and the staff were extremely efficient and well trained. The only saving grace in the restaurant was one of the supervisors named Niroshana, who I fear was fighting a losing battle. He was very professional and even tried to help out with a problem we had in one of our rooms. He went above and beyond - this man deserves a big promotion!!! The beach was gorgeous and the main reason we chose this hotel. But, bearing in mind the hotel has 159 rooms, there were only TWENTY beach beds with umbrellas, and some of those were broken. So we were not always lucky enough to get a sunbed. Pretty poor service considering the price of the rooms. All in all, I probably would not stay there again and I do wonder why there was such disparity between two hotels under the same management (Habarana and Bentota).","Disappointing","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r936902494-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

At best, it can be considered a low-end 4-star hotel when compared to UK standards.

On the positive side, the hotel features a kids' club and a pleasant swimming pool.

However, there are notable negatives. The staff, in general, are inattentive and slow. Upon check-in, there was no welcome information, and the front desk handles only check-ins; all checkouts are managed elsewhere. Despite being 'upgraded' to a suite on the first night, it was situated right next to the train tracks, resulting in significant noise disturbance. I strongly advise against opting for such rooms.

Service, disaster at best.
Not sure where to start. We were little over 30 people from different parts of the USA. I put this family reunion together.
I have been going back and forth with the management to make sure everything went well. Dharaka (F&B Manager) was very responsive.  I didn't want my family members to point the finger at me. I owned 12 restaurants in New York City over 20 year span. Very demanding place with 45000 restaurants. I am very critical about service. Those things you can fix. Structure you cant.
First impression - When you enter they have drummers. After that its all downhill. Front desk is a disaster. They are 5 people to say Aubowan  ( Welcome). Nobody knows what their job is. It took one hour to check 11 people in. Higher management should travel to Mexico or the Caribbean to see how well 500  plus hotel rooms check people in.  We couldn't take it anymore & we went to have lunch. After lunch I had to come looking for them ( front desk) to see what's happening. There was one girl doing everything. Sorry, she is not trained. I know the name. But I would not mention it for her to get in trouble. Other people went through the same thing. Also they are not good with wheel chair accessibility. We had an older person in the group.

Restaurants - Food is off the chart. Chefs and the cooking staff knows what they are doing. Very impressive. I never had a bad meal.
Service - Its horrible. Almost every time we sat for a meal, we had  to ask for napkins, cutleries, glasses, water etc. Tables were never ready. Supervisor named Niroshan was working so hard to get things done. He was tired of telling wait staff what to do. Every time you look they were 5 waiters around the cappuccino machine. Again, these waiters were not trained. You have to give them dedicated tables. That way they are responsible for it and they can earn extra tips. I saw waiters have been pulled on every direction. Again its a management issue.
Only reason I am giving 2 stars for service because of Dharaka & Niroshan's effort. They were working very hard. Others were working hard too. But not efficient.

New Years Eve celebration - Below average. I was disappointed. Very small dance floor on the grass. It was not enough for the crowed. Band was OK. DJ played a good first set. After midnight he decided play music that everyone left the dance floor. Usually Sri Lankan NYE parties goes until 4am. We were done by 1am.

Property - Amazing location. Water on either side. Beach is amazing. Room service guys were really good.
I paid close to $3000 for 4 days for 2 rooms. Its not cheap. We left disappointed.
I dont think, any of our group will be back at Cinnamon Bentota.","Great property with bad service. Top notch food.

The architecture and the interiors are amazing. What I didn’t like and appreciate was their staff. Especially at the front desk. 
We checked in sometime around 5 pm and had to wait a long time, they were incredibly slow. Tried calling so many times to speak with the hotel staff but all phone numbers provided were unavailable. Same thing about check out experience. No air conditioner or even a fan - check in inside the ac lounge, check out inside another place- it’s a mess. Front desk staff roams around as if they have all the time in the world. Just had one request for twin beds - which weren’t entertained. Our rooms were 2321 and 2321 both quite far from the main dining area, beach and pool side because we were travelling with two senior citizens with mobility issues - no golf cart - nothing. 
Also near the pool / spa area it is so dimly lit that one might trip and fall down anytime. 
The best thing has to be their food, I was there celebrating my birthday - even clearly mentioned that couldn’t celebrate on the day because of other issues - no cake nothing were provided. 
Even though it’s a beautiful property I didn’t like their staff - they were quite nonchalant. Housekeeping was just about ok. The spa experience for my other three family members were excellent unfortunately I was assigned a male therapist for foot massage and head shoulder massage - I strongly feel he is an accountant who was given this job because there were less staff he didn’t know what the hell he was doing. I didn’t want to complain about someone but did leave a note with the manage to look into this pathetic service experience at the spa.","Just about ok","2023-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r927790690-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",
