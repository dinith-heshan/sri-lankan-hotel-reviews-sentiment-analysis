The bathroom was exquisite (really it is like a private spa) and has inspired my dream home in the future. There really is no way to come to a place like this and not completely relax and recharge. My husband & I got massages during our stay at the on site spa and we both agreed that they were the best massages we had ever had hands down (A surprise bonus was the complimentary foot massages!). Everyone was super nice and attentive to details, I must give a special mention to our butler Durala (hopefully I have spelled his name correctly) who made our stay extra special. Also food & drinks were amazing, the menu rotates to keep things interesting and the chef's are willing to accommodate requests even if something is not listed on the menu that day- I had a chicken lime soup that I requested more then once because it was that good!

Super sauber, großzügig mit viel Platz, einem herrlichen Badezimmer und sogar einem privaten Pool nur für uns. 

Gern nutzen wir auch den großen Pool direkt am Meer, wo wir uns gut erholen konnten. Auch dieser war wunderbar sauber und kaum waren wir da, brachte man auch schon Auflagen und Handtücher vorbei. Ganz toller Service.

Auch das Spa haben wir genutzt und wohl mit die besten Massagen erhalten, die wir je hatten. Vielen Dank.

Das allerbeste waren jedoch die Mahlzeiten. Die Qualität der Küche ist erstklassig und der Service, den uns unser Butler Prabath zum Essen, aber auch in der Villa geleistet hat, war wirklich vorzüglich. Alle unsere Wünsche wurden direkt erfüllt und es gab nichts zu verbessern. Zudem hatten wir immer das Gefühl absoluter Sicherheit im Hotel.

Dass dies alles - auch in Sri Lanka - seinen Preis hat, versteht sich von selbst. Als kleinen Tipp könnte man hinterlassen, etwas kurzfristiger zu buchen. Dann gibt es oft etwas günstigere Preise.

We booked the Deluxe Suite with a private pool, and it was amazing. Super spacious, beautifully designed, and had the most incredible direct view of the ocean – waking up to that every morning was something special. The whole villa had such a peaceful, luxurious vibe.

A big shoutout to our personal butler, Rushan, who really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. He was always there when we needed anything, super friendly, and really made us feel at home.

The food was excellent too – every meal was delicious and there was a great variety to choose from. Whether we were dining by the pool or in the restaurant, the quality and service were spot on.

This serene haven, nestled amidst lush forests, offers an unparalleled blend of luxury, authenticity, and heartfelt hospitality, making it a destination we wholeheartedly recommend.
We were accommodated in Villas 5 and 7 – my wife, Jennifer, and I in Villa 7, and our son, Joshua, in Villa 5. The villas are a testament to thoughtful design and impeccable craftsmanship. They mirror the stunning imagery showcased online, boasting elegant interiors, modern amenities, and a sense of privacy that allows guests to fully immerse themselves in the tranquillity of the surroundings. The attention to detail in the villas’ furnishings and layout reflects the high standards upheld by Glenross Living, ensuring both comfort and aesthetic delight.
One of the highlights of our stay was our introduction to yoga and meditation under the expert guidance of Sumegha Rao. As novices, we approached these sessions with curiosity and were rewarded with an experience that was both transformative and deeply moving. Practising amidst the forest, with playful monkeys traversing the treetops and the gentle rustle of leaves as our soundtrack, created a profound connection with nature that we will cherish forever. Sumegha’s patience and skill made these sessions accessible and inspiring, fostering a sense of calm that permeated our entire stay.
The spa facilities at Glenross Living are equally remarkable. Joshua and I indulged in Balinese massages, which were executed with exceptional professionalism and care. The serene ambience of the spa, coupled with the therapists’ expertise, provided a restorative experience that left us feeling rejuvenated and at peace. This dedication to guest wellness underscores the holistic ethos of Glenross Living.
However, it is the staff who truly elevate Glenross Living from an exceptional retreat to an extraordinary one. Their warmth, professionalism, and genuine care transformed our stay into something truly special.
Larry, the host, is a remarkable individual whose passion for Glenross and its surroundings is infectious. His commitment to ensuring our comfort was evident in every interaction. Larry went above and beyond, personally guiding us on a visit to a local Buddha temple, which offered a fascinating glimpse into the region’s cultural heritage. He also led Joshua on an exhilarating jungle walk, sharing insights about the local flora and fauna that captivated our son’s imagination. Larry’s tour of the cinnamon and tea plantations was both educational and engaging, deepening our appreciation for the area’s agricultural traditions. Additionally, he introduced us to a nearby lake under development, showcasing Glenross’s commitment to sustainable tourism. When it came time to depart, Larry seamlessly arranged our transport to our next destination, ensuring a stress-free transition. His boundless energy, enthusiasm, and attentiveness made him the cornerstone of our experience, and we cannot praise him highly enough.
Our butler, Dilshan, was an absolute standout, providing impeccable service that elevated our stay to new heights. Dilshan’s attentiveness, professionalism, and genuine warmth made every moment effortless and enjoyable. From anticipating our needs with thoughtful gestures to ensuring our villas were perfectly maintained, he demonstrated an extraordinary dedication to our comfort. His friendly demeanour and ability to make us feel at home were truly remarkable, and we are immensely grateful for his outstanding contribution to our experience.
We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to Udara and Ishara, whose exceptional service and warm personalities left a lasting impression. From the moment we arrived, they greeted us with genuine smiles and an unwavering willingness to assist. Whether it was offering recommendations, ensuring our villas were immaculate, or simply engaging in friendly conversation, Udara and Ishara made us feel like cherished guests rather than mere visitors. Their dedication and professionalism are a credit to Glenross Living and a reflection of the exemplary standards upheld by the entire team.
The culinary offerings at Glenross Living deserve special mention. Each meal was a celebration of local flavours, prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients and presented with care. Dining amidst the natural beauty of the property, with attentive service from the staff, including Dilshan’s meticulous attention to detail, elevated every meal into a memorable occasion. The team’s ability to cater to our preferences while introducing us to authentic Sri Lankan cuisine was greatly appreciated.
Glenross Living is more than a destination; it is an experience that nurtures the body, mind, and soul. The seamless integration of luxurious accommodations, immersive activities, and outstanding hospitality creates a retreat that is both peaceful and profoundly enriching. We departed feeling rested, inspired, and deeply grateful for the memories we had created. Our family is already eagerly planning a return visit to this hidden gem, confident that it will once again exceed our expectations.
To Larry, Dilshan, Udara, Ishara, and the entire Glenross Living team: thank you for crafting an unforgettable stay. Your passion, professionalism, and genuine care make Glenross a beacon of hospitality. We wholeheartedly recommend this extraordinary retreat to anyone seeking a sanctuary of peace, authenticity, and heartfelt warmth.
With sincere appreciation,
Stephen, Jennifer, and Joshua","Amazing hotel and but the best part is the staff","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r1014003408-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

Glenross is the perfect place for anyone who wishes to observe nature close up, we sat in wonder whilst watching eagles soar above the tree canopies, searching for food among the jungle greenery, there are also lots on monkeys in the trees and they are great fun to watch, it is like being in an immersive nature show, except it is all real!

When we arrived we were met by Mr Harshana (also the asst GM at the Blue Water Hotel), Larry and Upali.   Once we had been shown to our villa we changed and relaxed in our own pool overlooking the jungle, this was the theme for our stay pretty much!

On the evening of our anniversary the management had arranged a wonderful surprise meal for us on the 'Tea Lawn' of the main house which was fantastic, and we owe a big thank you to Chef Nimal for this.

Thank you  for taking the time to share your experience at Glenross Living. We are truly delighted that you enjoyed the breathtaking scenery, luxurious villa, and warm hospitality from our team. Your kind words mean a lot to us.

We sincerely regret that your experience with our coffee was a complete misunderstanding. When you had requested for black coffee our butler had assumed that you had wanted our local coffee which is sometimes enjoyed by some of our guests. Had you specified a certain coffee like a Cappuccino or an Americano the butler would have definitely understood you better and served you that, as we have a good coffee machine in place in the restaurant.

Our apologies for that misunderstanding. 

Regarding your food experience we are somewhat surprised as there are many good comments with regards our food. If you had noticed, our last 4 star comment has been posted a very long time ago. However we are concerned about this comment and will take serious action with regards to this. I will personally contact you by email and get more specific details in order to take the corrective action to enhance our culinary offerings. 

We genuinely hope to welcome you back for another stay, where we can offer an improved experience and delight you with our hospitality.

Kind Regards

Everything was superb. The accommodation is first class, but it's the staff that make it 5 star. They will do anything for you and it makes them happy to make you happy. Ajith, Upali, Larry and their supporting team are fabulous and their unwavering service was really appreciated. They make you feel you are the only guests. Our villa was huge and was fully serviced every day. We loved watching the monkeys and bird life in the surrounding trees from our private pool. We also used the main pool when we wanted a longer swim. We were in Sri Lanka on a tour for 25 days and Glenross was the perfect ending to our trip. Oh, and the food - delicious!

The property is tucked away in a lush rubber plantation, and waking up to those beautiful views every morning was an absolute treat—Villa 5 really does have one of the best spots on the property.

The kids loved the rubber plantation tour. It was both fun and enlightening, giving them the chance to see local wildlife up close and learn about the process behind it all. We were also charmed by the 1876 bungalow, which has been so well cared for. It felt like stepping back in time, yet we still had all the modern comforts we needed. The infinity pool was a big hit, though I was definitely keeping a close eye on my toddler around the water!

We booked the Sands Suite (2 Bedroom Apartment with Private Plunge Pool) – and it really felt like our own small paradise. The jacuzzi with the ocean view was just something else! Watching the sunset while sitting there was like a dream.

Only downside was the jacuzzi jets – everytime we turned them on, an alarm would start after like 5 minutes, and we had to switch them off. Bit annoying cause we really wanted to enjoy the jets.

The room was big, super clean and very comfy. The jacuzzi was great, and everything felt new and well arranged. Very calm and relaxing vibes all around.

The staff were super nice, and the location is perfect – literally on the beach but also private and not noisy at all.

Breakfast was the only thing that didn’t match the rest. It wasn’t a buffet, and the food options were really limited – like small portions and few things to choose from. Felt more like a tasting menu than a real breakfast. We missed the big Sri Lankan breakfasts we had in other places. Also, fruits were very little. But the view from the restaurant was amazing, right on the ocean.

Wi-Fi was okay in the beginning, but weirdly I couldn’t play YouTube which was kinda frustrating.

Still, overall, we had a lovely time. So many nice moments and memories. Would totally recommend for couples looking for a peaceful and romantic break!","A Magical Stay at Crystal Sands","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r1012512970-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

От отеля в восторге! Понравилось всё. Чудесные современные номера с панорамными окнами в гостиной с видом на океан. Две спальни с отдельными ванными комнатами, кухонный уголок с плитой, духовкой, кофемашиной, микроволновкой, стиральной машиной. Особенно порадовало личное джакузи , прекрасно проводили в нем время наблюдая закат , а иногда и рассвет. 
Очень понравилось обслуживание- начиная с ресепшен и уборки, заканчивая обслуживанием в ресторане. 
Все просьбы выполнялись молниеносно, стоило написать в Вотсапп и буквально через 3-5 минут все готово . Обслуживающий персонал молодцы, очень стараются. 
Отдельную благодарность хотела бы выразить Hirush Aloko и Tharindu (house keeping). Убирали они в номере 703.
Работают замечательно!! Все вещи сложены и аккуратно повешены, все чисто и красиво. Но!! Самое удивительное то, как они убирают детские игрушки! Весь детский бардак превращается в идеальную красоту! Никогда не видела такого трепетного отношения к уборке. Спасибо им огромное.
Пляж хороший, песчаный, заход в воду также без камней и кораллов. Океан с волнами, как и практически  на всем побережье , однако мы все купались, включая детей ( дети под обязательным присмотром) Лежаков не очень много, но всем хватало. При необходимости  сотрудники организовывали дополнительные места . На пляже только гости отеля - тихо , спокойно и немноголюдно.
За пределами отеля гулять особенно негде, до центра можно доехать на тук-туке или такси. В Хиккадуве есть фруктовый и рыбный рынок, на тук-туке 3000 рупий в обе стороны. Фрукты , креветки и рыбу покупали только там. Иногда ездили обедать и ужинать в Хиккадуву, иногда ели в нашем ресторане , цены приемлимые. Подача и вкус блюд на 5. Можно заказывать еду в номер. 
Завтраки у нас были включены, вкусные. 
На свой день рождения я получила в качестве комплимента вкусный тортик со свечой. Было очень приятно . Отель однозначно рекомендую.","Прекрасный современный отель","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r1010025044-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The villa was spacious and luxurious, featuring three rooms with attached washrooms, a private plunge pool, and both indoor and outdoor seating areas. Having Alexa for assistance was a unique touch that added to the experience.

We loved spending time at the rooftop infinity pool and bar, which had a breathtaking view of the ocean. For meals, we had a set menu for lunch and dinner and a buffet for breakfast..food was  delicious and well presented..

A special shoutout to Deepani, the front desk manager, who was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. If you're visiting, definitely reach out to her she'll go above and beyond to help you.

From booking to check out, the entire process was seamless. The staff was friendly and the food was exceptionally good. We ordered meals via room service several times because of this. 

The beds and pillows were so comfortable, quite a few times people ended up napping when they didn't want to. The ACs were strong and kept the apartment cool regardless of the humid weather. The apartment was clean with great amenities. We loved that there was an oven and a microwave, as well as a fridge and a freezer. We liked the automated Alexa who lowered and raised the blinds everyday. 

The rooftop restaurant was good with a decent breakfast spread.  

As this is an apartment, there were a few hiccups with functionality in a few cases, but they were not issues that took away from the overall experience.

Обслуживание на высоком уровне – на все просьбы реагировали мгновенно. Персонал был улыбчивый и дружелюбный.  Уборка проводилась дважды в день, а ежедневное пополнение мини-бара (вода, кола, спрайт, содовая, чай четырёх видов, кофе) – приятный бонус.  Завтраки вкусные, но ассортимент немного скудный.

Несколько дней нашей поездки омрачили сильные волны, из-за которых купание стало затруднительным. Однако, поездка в Хиккадуху на машине с кондиционером оказалась существенно выгоднее, чем на тук-туке, предлагаемом у отеля (заказывала через приложение PickMe).

Из недостатков стоит отметить:

* Удаленность от магазинов и кафе.
* Отсутствие шумоизоляции в окнах. Ночью слышен шум океана, а при сильных волнах окна вибрируют.

В целом, отель оставил положительное впечатление, но удаленность от инфраструктуры и шум океана могут стать препятствием для некоторых гостей.","Отдых удался!)","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r1000870403-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Хорошо что один из телевизионных каналов был российский.
Ресторан на 10 этаже очень хороший, мы ходили только на завтраки, все было достаточно разнообразно, много и вкусно.  Ежедневная уборка в номере. Персонал очень дружелюбный. Удобно было, что администрация отеля присылала полезную информацию прямо на мой WhatsApp.

Что именно нам не подошло: рядом с отелем нет продуктовых магазинов, рынков, кафе и развлечений. Отель расположен в 8-10 км от ближайших городков Хиккадува и Галле, где кипит жизнь и до которых надо ехать на такси, тук-туке или автобусе. Собственный  пляж отеля подходит для тех, кто любит только загорать - постоянно бьет большая волна (на пляжах Хиккадувы такого нет, там спокойно), которая взмучивает песок и вода мутная, нужно прорываться через волны и отплыть от берега  где нет волн, но возвращаться к берегу приходится снова бороться с волной.","Отличный отель для спокойного отдыха без развлечений","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r999464231-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Свой день рождения провела в этом прекрасном месте. 
Нас очень тепло встретили после перелета, на время ожидания заселения предложили холодный чай с лаймом, засели раньше положенного времени. 
Вид из номера завораживает, а засыпать под настоящий шум моря просто фантастика. 
Мы останавливались большой компанией - пять взрослых и малышка до года. 
К ней было особенное отношение

За 10 дней нам ставили два раза свежие цветы, в день рождения украсили номер шариками и подарили еще цветы; по любому требованию чего-либо все исполняли в миг: прибрать, принести столовые приборы или посуду и т.п. 

В номере есть все для комфортного отдыха - фен, гладильная доска, утюг, капсульная кофемашина,  чайник и милый заварник, чай листовой, никаких пакетиков, еще есть френчпресс и кофе к нему. Так что утром каждый пил напитки по своему желанию. В холодильнике были кола, содовая и спрайт бесплатно. Воду приносили в бутылке 19 л

Кухня оснащена техникой - мы запекали курицу с картошкой, варили борщ на плите 😀микроволновка быстро размораживает и согревает. 

Сервис отеля на высоте. Все приветливые, обходительные, легко обо всем можно договориться (переводчик в помощь)). Когда уезжали было грустно прощаться с виллой, этим видом из окна и обслуживающим персоналом. Особенно наш отдых украшал менеджер Хируш Алока, который максимально старался во всем для нас. Подсказывал куда можно сходить, где купить продукты, играл с нашей дочкой, прибирался тщательно. Очень добрый и общительный, в конце сделал памятный подарок, который теперь стоит у нас дома и радует - общее фото с ним и всей нашей компанией. Было очень грустно с ним прощаться, подписались друг на друга в соцсетях. Виллу за раз убирали несколько человек, кто-то бассейн, кто-то кухню, таким образом всё подвергалось чистке. Спасибо ребятам Лакмал и Прабхат. 

Готовились при поездке на Шри-Ланку к самому худшему, пугали и антисанитарией, и слабым сервисом, и большими волнами. Все это оказалось только страшными байками. 
Сервис был на высоте, волны были большими, но парням только и в радость. Заход очень приятный, никаких камней и коралловых рифов под ногами, пляж без людей, только пару лежаков от нашего отеля. Чувствуешь себя очень уединенно и спокойно. А за спокойным океаном ездили в другие места, например, Джангл бич, кормили там обезьян, но там и людей очень много, и всё встречается вышеупомянутое. Так что везде есть свои огромные плюсы) минусов пока не нашли. 
Единственное - взяли бы лучше завтраки. Так как ресторан очень вкусный. Праздновали там день рождения, и все остались оооочень довольны. 

По расположению отеля еще добавлю - он находится между двух популярных мест - Хиккадува и Галле. Мы катались каждый день на тук-туке за 1-2500 тыс рупий, в зависимости от расстояния. Для нас это не проблема. Возле отеля нет супермаркетов и кафешек, но планировали свой маршрут так, чтобы возвращаться с моря и заезжать куда надо за чем надо. Тоже не проблема. кому нужны тусовки, вечеринки, то лучше останавливаться в местах оживленнее с развитой инфраструктурой, а этот отель для спокойного и умиротворенного отдыха, на крайний случай - тук-туки ездят постоянно))

Amazing service all day long. The staff is always smiling with a friendly atmosphere and helpful tips to explore this gem of an area.  The first night at dinner had a fantastic flute player who had a wide array of flutes from around the world. Rooms are clean and have a unique train station theme. Room 105 was perfect.

Priyatha at the front desk checked in on us throughout the stay, making sure everything ran smoothly. And Sjwani, who served us daily, truly went the extra mile. My wife’s vegetarian meals were made exactly to preference, and baby food was thoughtfully arranged without reminders.

Reason for us keep  coming back to this magical place is because we find it the best on the South Coast of Sri Lanka. As you enter the premises first thing that strikes you is the 180 degree breathtaking ocean views. Villa is tastefully decorated with antiques, beautiful paintings and local furniture that reflex the Sri Lankan heritage.  There are three  large bedrooms with all amenities provided, comfort level here is very high, to be precise 5/5. King beds in the rooms are very comfortable and you are sure to get a goodnight’s sleep.

Manager, chef and other staff are wonderful, they are kind helpful and efficient, nothing is too much trouble for them. The meals they serve are delicious, all you need to do is let them know what your favourite dishes are.  Whether it’s Sri Lankan curries or western dishes they will make it for you and you will love it.  Owner and the staff of South Point Villa take customer service and customer satisfaction very seriously.  That reflects on everything they provide for you during your stay here.  

Highlight of our holiday was sitting on the back terrace overlooking the ocean, enjoying a cold beer and watching the amazing sunset and the stilt fishermen in action which is unique to Sri Lanka. Our stay at South Point Villa was memorable so without any hesitation we can recommend this villa for your next holiday and you certainly won’t be disappointed.

I stayed here this time with my husband, kids and my parents so we could have some quality time together. 

And South Point was the perfect paradise that embodies all the luxuries of Sri Lanka. The villa is beachfront, with the ocean just steps away - it was so soothing hearing the rolling waves, especially while relaxing on the deck chairs during the day or eating home made pancakes for afternoon tea right next to ocean. It feels like your own private beach!

The culinary experience is absolutely divine! Having a personal chef whip up authentic Sri Lankan feasts is truly pampering feeling.  She was so lovely and attentive to all our food wishes - and always followed up to check on satisfaction levels. And used the freshest of ingredients (some grown on the estate itself) - catering to both Sri Lankan and Western palettes  - depending on what you feel like eating. The butler, Nishantha was also really attentive and so humble - a really pleasant person who ensured we had the best eating experience every time we sat down to dine. These factors really enhanced the time we spent together as a family as the backdrop was amazing, and everything is taken care of, and all we had to focus on was enjoying being with each other!

I also love the decor of the villa, you can tell each item and piece of furniture has been thoughtfully chosen to create an authentic Sri Lankan but very boutique interior - with comfort at the center. 

Gamani and his team were super helpful, arranging for us to see the horses across the street and even brought them over for our kids to see them, and if we wanted to do tours, he was more than happy to coordinate them. 

When we weren’t having an amazing dining experience, relaxing on a sun chair or seeing some sights, we enjoyed splashing around in the pool! And the kids had a ball. Equally, playing in the sand for hours within our view while we could also relax on the verandah. It’s the best of both worlds! In the evenings, we enjoyed going for a beach stroll during sunset, or playing board games on the outdoor deck.

During this trip to Sri Lanka, we stayed at multiple places, including 5-star hotels like  the Shangri-la - and honestly, none of them compare to the personalized and high end, boutique experience we had at South Point - it really is Sri Lanka at its best!

I cannot recommend it enough!!","A boutique paradise experience - Sri Lanka at its best!","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d643117-r920372636-South_Point_Villa-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you so much for sharing your lovely experience.

We’re delighted to hear that your stay near Kandy offered such a memorable contrast to your time at Jetwing Vil Uyana. The serene river views and quiet surroundings truly make this location unique, and we're so pleased you enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere.

It’s wonderful to know the room and its amenities met your expectations. Even if the hanger space was a bit limited, we’re glad the spacious bathroom and comfortable beds added to your comfort. We’ll certainly look into the storage feedback to improve further.

Your kind words about the meals and the service, especially your appreciation for Shanika, have been passed on with heartfelt thanks. Our team takes great pride in offering personalised care, and it’s lovely to know she made such a positive impression during your stay.

We hope to welcome you back again soon for another relaxing escape.

Set on a hill amongst the rubber and cinnamon trees ,overlooking the valley below and views of  distant hills sits Glenross Living.  We stayed in one of 7 stunning,luxurious, and spacious private  villas. We loved  watching the monkeys play in the trees below our private pool or whilst sitting in the most incredible bath looking out of the full height windows . It's absolutely stunning.The service we received in this hotel from every single member of staff  was exceptional ,whilst remaining warm and friendly.Meals in the hotel were delicious and beautifully presented . All the waiting staff were wonderful and so accommodating ,but we must make  particular mention of Ajith the head of this team who was simply wonderful, and he greeted us every day as if we were old friends . Both Ajith and assistant manager Larry went out of their way to ensure we were happy and had everything we wanted. They simply couldn't do enough for us, and we loved being made to feel so welcome.
We must also mention Chamath, who is such a lovely ,enthusiastic, and engaging  person. He took us out into the jungle on a nature hike ,which was amazing! Massages from Putri were outstanding, and yoga with Rikki   enlightening, bringing focus and calm to a busy life ,something we hope to continue .
What this hotel has achieved is very special because it combines warm ,friendly service with luxury accommodation .It is not pretentious in any way ,something quite rare to find. What manager Shamil is creating here with this team  is very special, and we hope to return again . Thank you ,we loved every moment, what an experience.

Stay in a sleek pool villa overlooking the rubber jungle or bed down in the main house - a pretty whitewashed Scottish cottage with a homely atmosphere, pool, restaurant and quaint tea garden. 

You must book a hike with the charming Asela (an experienced local naturalist) to learn about the wildlife. Don't miss out on a private session with Chamath either to explore the ancient Sri Lankan martial art of Angampora. Putri's massages are incredible too. 

Thank you to Shamil and all of the team for an unforgettable stay. The staff were all superb.

 There are group classes with CLASSICAL HATHA Yoga every day.
Additionally, we can take advantage of individual lessons that allow us to experience the practice of energy release and get to know our body and interior.
The classes are led by my friend Rikki. 

Rikki was very helpful and gave many insights on the yogic science. He taught Surya Shakti which is a powerful form of sun salutation. The practice made me feel very energised and powerful.

The location, nestled between foggy mountains, rolling clouds and luscious forests, made for a most magical trip.

But as tremendous as the venue was, it’s the staff that made our stay even more enjoyable. Ajith, Upali, Putri, Udara and the others were a joy to deal with. They greeted and interacted with us with so much kindness every single day. Their service was beyond reproach. They embody the very essence of Sri Lankan conviviality.

Udara greeted us upon arrival and took care of transfers within the property throughout our stay with his friendly demeanour making us feel right at home. 

Ajith was absolutely amazing as our host. He took such great care of us and made us feel super special. With his endless smile and savoir-faire, he accommodated our requests with ease and made sure our dietary requirements were met. He expertly guided us around the grounds and helped with our needs. We would come back to Glenross just to bask in his hospitality. 

The food is a culinary experience in and of itself. A mix of western and local delicacies, every meal was varied enough to satisfy any palate. The hidden heroes of the kitchen created scrumptuous, healthy and colourful meals three times a day. Every plate was an adventure.

Putri, the massage therapist, is very talented. We had the Balinese massage which left us feeling weightless, elated and pain-free. We wish we could have had more sessions with her to take further advantage of her stress/tension-relieving skills.

The villas themselves were very cozy and modern.  All the facilities were well maintained and spotless. Upali and his team were superb.  

The cinnamon and rubber-tapping tour was very enlightening. The amount of effort that goes into harvesting these resources is unbelievable.

Our only recommendation would be to wear suitable shoes, especially on rainy days, as the gravel-laced, bumpy and muddy roads can get slippery. Oh, and beware of mosquitoes. Those buggers can be a handful at times! 

One major hassle we faced upon checking out was that all our international bank cards were not accepted even though we used them to pay for the online reservation & elsewhere around Sri Lanka. Luckily for us, we knew a local who helped us pay for the stay. But as you can imagine, it was quite embarrassing.

Other than that, let the staff at Glenross and the location pamper you.  It's a fantastically serene place to unwind. We definitely plan to visit again.","A Magical Stay","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r987722618-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

It was a much-needed vacation for both of us, and those two nights we spent at Glenross were the main highlight of our one-month stay in Sri Lanka. We both would like to thank again the chefs, management, and all the staff members in Glenross Living for making our stay a memorable and amazing one. Also, we are counting the days until we come again for another beautiful stay at Glenross Living, and we highly recommend this place again and again.","An unforgettable stay with a truly amazing surrounding","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r982058519-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, the team went above and beyond to make sure everything went exactly to plan.

Every detail was flawlessly executed, our room was perfectly located, the flowers were kept fresh and cool, and the dinner setting was beyond perfect. The staff paid attention to even the smallest details, like tailoring the menu to our specific tastes and adding dishes simply because my fiancée mentioned a craving. We were also surprised with a celebratory cake upon our return visit, a thoughtful gesture that truly touched us.

Special thanks to General Manager Mr. Farrel, who took time out of his busy day to check in on us, reassure me when I had last-minute nerves, and ensure everything unfolded seamlessly. Mr. Badde, our butler, was incredible, no request was too small, and every detail was handled with care and precision to make our stay truly perfect. Even the cleaning staff went the extra mile by preparing our room during dinner so we could return to a space ready for a restful night.

What makes Saman Villas stand out isn’t just the luxury, but the sincerity and warmth of the people. Their dedication to sustainability is also evident throughout the property, from the eco-friendly amenities in the room to the thoughtful practices observed during our stay.

Saman Villas will always hold a special place in our hearts. It’s more than a resort, it’s an experience that blends serenity, luxury, and genuine hospitality.

Situated on a stunning beach that offered a unique sense of being in the middle of sea, Jetwing Saman Villas delivered both the privacy we sought and exceptional luxury from arrival to departure. While the accommodation and food were outstanding, the highlight was the exceptional hospitality. Special recognition goes to Kavindu, Thilani, and Sashika for their attentive care, though the entire staff was remarkably kind and considerate. 

We stayed in a deluxe suite with a pool which was so much fun. Each room has a designated butler whom you can call if you need anything but we didn’t not have to use this service since everything you need was there already. The minibar was free for use for the first instance and had a reasonable range of local alcohol and fizzy drinks. The bed was very comfortable and the room had automated blinds that ensures a good sleep.

The food was delightful as well. They were made with a twist of Sri Lankan flavor and apparently most of the items are locally sourced . Hats off to chefs for creating such amazing dishes. We wanted to taste a bit of everything and the staff was so kind to accommodate.

Бутик-отель jetwingsamanvillas 
объективно один из лучших на Шри-Ланке. Великолепная атмосфера умиротворения, покоя и гармонии. Отель расположен в роскошном тропическом лесу, среди кокосовых пальм на берегу Индийского океана. Здесь все способствует роскошному отдыху, начиная от великолепных вилл и заканчивая сервисом. Мы пожелали жить в вилле на первом этаже ближе к океану, чтобы в любую минуту можно было спускаться к океану…. Вилла великолепная, большая и уютная, с ванной под открытым небом, столиком на веранде и всем необходимым. У входа стояла чаша для обмывания ног, в которой всегда менялись свежие цветы. В номере всегда было все необходимое и каждый день свежие цветы. В любое время, по желанию, можно заказать еду в номер. Вид на океан божественный, купаться нужно осторожно, волны бывают с человеческий рост. На территории есть отличный бассейн с подсветкой и перспективой на бесконечность.  Хочется выразить особую благодарность нашему обожаемому дворецкому Janith, который отлично выполняет свою работу и превратил наше пребывание в отеле в волшебную сказку ❤️ А так же выразить благодарность всему персоналу отеля за уникальную атмосферу и отличный сервис. Немного об обслуживании…. Нас встретили с шампанским, быстро оформили и проводили в виллу на 2м этаже. Я попросила первый и ближе к океану, нас переселили в течение 15 минут. Кухня здесь что то между европейской и индийской. Завтраки очень вкусные и большие, обслуживание быстрое. У нас был включен завтрак и ужин. Обедали мы в ресторане или просили принести в номер. Обслуживание быстрое. В основном нас обслуживал наш дворецкий, он идеально выполнял все наши капризы, а мы любим покушать)) Разъяснял концепцию каждого блюда, как положено в хороших ресторанах. Так как мы долго отдыхали в этом отеле, для нас было организовано много сюрпризов, ужин у бассейна с подсветкой был незабываемый. Как то в обед нам сделали неожиданный сюрприз в виде блюда, которое я выложила на фото, с угощениями из местной кухни. А на прощание нам устроили вечер с шампанским, выложили на постеле “I will miss you “ из цветов. В день отъезда сделали с нами совместное фото и  подарили нам на память фотографии. Когда нас провожали до автомобиля, мне хотелось плакать. 
Да, еще немного о СПА салоне, первую процедуру подарили мне и моей дочери, следующие мы посетили платно. Мы получили массаж Аюроведа, он был великолепен! Есть с чем сравнивать, мы посещали центр Аюроведа на Бали.  
В целом, Шри-Ланка это потрясающая теплая страна, богатая красивыми, великодушными, талантливыми и улыбчивыми людьми ❤️
Мы с дочкой остались очень довольны отдыхом, рекомендую этот роскошный отель бутик своим друзьям и знакомым. Спасибо за незабываемый отдых! Мы обязательно к вам вернемся ❤️","Лучший бутик-отель на Шри-Ланке.

But this time absolutely incredible, the food was a complete game changer. beautifully presented, full of flavor, and clearly prepared with care and creativity. Every dish we had was delicious, from starters to dessert. It felt like the culinary experience had been completely elevated since our last visit, and we were so pleasantly surprised.

Nothing was too much trouble and they were full of smiles all of the time. It really made us feel welcome and valued and we had a lovely few days with them.

We were assigned a personal bus on arrival who not only looked after us at meal times and anything we needed but also looked after our room as well.

A special appreciation to Mr. Lakmal (Housekeeping Manager), Mr. Naveen (Food & Beverage Manager), and the entire housekeeping team for their warm hospitality and attention to detail. Mr. Shammi and the team ensured our rooms were always immaculate and welcoming.

The restaurant staff was outstanding, offering a different menu every day with a wide selection of delicious, high-quality food. Every meal was a delight, and their excellent service made dining a wonderful experience.

From the front desk to housekeeping, the restaurant team, and lifeguards, everyone made us feel at home.

1 - очень стильный, современный отель с прекрасным видом на океан!
2 - номер:
Проживали в вилле с двумя отдельными спальнями со взрослой дочерью.
В каждой спальне свой санузел с душевой кабиной, есть шампунь и  кондиционер (хорошего качества), молочко для тела, гель для душа и жидкое мыло. Есть ватные диски, ватные палочки, шапочка для для душа.
Нет набора для чистки зубов!!!
Очень удобные подушки!!! Особенно вторая, которая менее наполненная.
Есть отдельный кондиционер в каждой спальне.
В санузле окошко, которое расположено достаточно высоко, что тебя не видно, но видно океан и окружающую природу, очень здорово, особенно утром.
Звукоизоляция просто великолепная!!!
Ни разу не слышали соседей и никто нам не стучал и не просил сделать телевизор потише, так как до 24-00 мы смотрели какое либо кино...
3 - кухня в номере: 
Отдельно хочется сказать про наполнение кухонной зоны: по приезду посуды в номере не много: бокалы и чашки для кофе/чая. Но по первой просьбе на ресепшн все принесли: и приборы, и тарелки, и кастрюли, и сковороду)
Есть индукционная плита, микроволновка, так же есть духовка. И стиральная машина!
Большой холодильник.
4 - плюшки:
Не нашла этой информации в отзывах, поэтому постараюсь все перечислить:
- капсулы для кофемашины (капсульная кофемашина есть),
- кофе молотый для заваривания в чайнике френч-пресс (чайник есть), 
- 4 вида чая (жасминовый зеленый, масала, зеленый и черный), которые насыпаны в специальные баночки  и стильный чайник,
- 2 коробочки с молоком по 180 гр в холодильнике,
- 2 бутылочки колы 0,3 л,
- 2 бутылочки спрайта 0,3 л,
- 1 бутылка минеральной воды 0,3 л,
- 1 бутылка тоника 0,3 л,
Пополняется ежедневно при уборке.
- фильтрованная вода в многоразовый бутылках, 4 шт по 0,5 л.
Но если надо больше, то по просьбе на ресепшн принесут!)
Так же есть много позиций мини бара, не пользовались)
4 - круглосуточный тренажерный зал:
не большой, но дорожка беговая есть, элипсоид, гантели, 2 лавки, универсальный тренажер, 4 коврика, полотенца, вода, кондиционер (2 шт).
5 - ресторан:
Сразу после заселения на вотсап прислали меню ресторан и напитки. Можно по цене ориентироваться.
НО!!!
в прайсе указано только 10% сервисного сбора, а на самом деле еще 2 каких то сбора есть! Поэтому к цене по прайсу надо прибавлять 35%, вот это будет итоговая цена!
Но это ни в коем случае не умаляет качество питания и обслуживания: коктейли просто великолепны, блюда раз на раз не попадешь, но не вкусно не было ни разу!
Подача, обслуживание, просто восторг!
Кстати, что мы не могли осилить, нам упаковывали с собой по нашей просьбе)
6 - что рядом:
Ничего, по большому счету...
Если выйти на дорогу, встать спиной к отелю и пойти налево, то минут через 12 будет винный магазин (через дорогу).
Но идти очень не комфортно, так как тротуаров совсем нет...
До того, как дойдете до винного магазина, тоже через дорогу, видела мясной магазин (с сырым мясом), которое можно прекрасно приготовить самостоятельно!
7 - где купить минимально продукты и напитки:
берете тук тук на территории нашего отеля и едете с ним в Хиккадуву до отеля Цитрус Хиккадува (2000 рупий туда и обратно такса).
Через дорогу от этого отеля есть супермаркет, в котором мы покупали яйца, растительное масло, хлеб, некоторые фрукты, сыр (который оказался плавленным, типа тостерного). Ну и много перекусов: печенье, чипсы, орешки есть.
На втором этаже алкомаркет: выбор хороший, цены смотрите на фото.
8 - океан:
волны были большие каждый день, но с утра поменьше как то.
Купаться сложно, так как волна сбивает с ног и обратное течение не слабое.
Но около берега можно прекрасно бороться с остатками волны и весело побарахтаться) Поплавать от берега не получится!
Кто с детками: только со взрослым заходить в воду!!! И если ребенок копошится около воды, тоже следить! Очень внимательно!!!
Спасатель каждый день внимательно наблюдает за всеми купающимися, но не рискуйте!
9 - пляж:
великолепный ярко желтый (даже немного оранжевый) песок, по структуре, как крупная соль, достаточно чистый, но все таки иногда попадаются мелкие нюансы: фантики, окурки и др...
При заходе в океан сначала этот песок, а через метра 3 очень приятные мелкий песочек!
Лежаков иногда не всем хватало, но сотрудники отеля приносили все возможные варианты (сиденье от дивана, мягкие кресла).
Пресный душ находится в ветвях дерева на территории рядом с краном для ног.
Его не видно, но он там есть!)
10 - рестораны Хиккадувы:
ездили пару раз на ужин, были в двух разных кафе, рестораном назвать не могу...
Нормально, если одним словом... С нашим рестораном в отеле близко нельзя сравнивать: вроде и стараются, и подача красивая, и коктейли интересные, но вот муравьи, которые тоже хотят полакомиться твои блюдом, песок под ногами, аскетичный теалет, раковина для мытья рук, где нет чем руки вытереть или высушить... Меня не порадовала даже живая музыка, которая было хороша...
11 - Галле:
Рядом есть городок Галле (в противоположную сторону от Хиккадувы).
Там есть форд, который является достоянием Юнеско.
Обязательно к посещению: погулять, пройтись по магазинчикам с сувенирами и украшениями, посмотреть архитектуру прошлого!
Мы там купили самые простецкие роти по 200 рупий в уличном павильончике, вот это было очень вкусно!!!
В целом отель очень понравился, персонала очень много, все приветливые и старательные, намеков на чаевые не было вообще.","Подробный отзыв об отеле и не только!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r989949460-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Отдыхали с молодым человеком, всё очень понравилось, персонал очень дружелюбный, сервис на уровне, номер убирали каждый день.
На завтрак 5 дней был шведский стол, остальные дни по меню, ужин всегда по меню. Всё очень вкусно. Отдельно хочу отметить  Dilki, очень милая и дружелюбная девушка. 
В номере очень красивый вид с балкона, дизайн номеров стильный и современный, есть все необходимое.
Море всегда с волнами, штиля нет. Но волны небольшие, мы купались каждый день, вполне комфортно.

Gamini (the manager) greeted us at the gate ( he was also worried when we got a bit late to arrive) and constantly checked if we needed anything. Anil who was handling maintenance ensured we were comfortable in every way! Even helped us with the BBQ. Mali the cook and her daughters were also friendly and ever so helpful. In our many years of traveling we have not come across such helpful staff - They are the  the definition of true Sri Lankan Hospitality.

Facilities:
The location was clean and well maintained. The pool was a blessing on a hot April afternoon.

We were allowed to spend the evenings at the beach front villa. The almost private beach and the settled sea was an amazing experience.

The restaurant was wonderful, the Sri Lankan curry was incredibly delicious, with such friendly attentive service throughout.

I was only there one night on a stop over so did not use the pool facilities but it was beautiful and massive overlooking the river with an open air concept lobby like you were on a Caribbean Island.

This was 
another great experience (we arrived from Sigiriya where we stayed at Vil Uyana).

This is a relatively new hotel with 26 rooms. The “luxury” rooms we had were large, and very well thought through, the bathrooms were equally spacious.

This is a wonderful property, serene, quiet and restful with a great location (note the hotel is about 11km from Kandy town centre so you miss out all the noise and traffic).  

All of the hotel staff were absolutely amazing and friendly, special recognition to Vijitha who was assigned to look after us during our stay, and made it even more memorable.

The food was delicious, both International and Sri Lankan cuisines. They went above and beyond (proud) to showcase local cuisines offering us samples of certain local dishes ( a big thank you to Mr Leukebandara for the suggestions) .  A final salute to the Chef/ cooks for keeping us very well fed.

Ranjan and the team anticipated our every need whether it was afternoon tea, getting a taxi to go into Galle, buying tonic waters or a meal request. And yes, the food. Phenomenal. Who knew there were so many amazing Sri Lankan curries, wonderful fresh seafood, local vegetables and fruits? We were excited for every meal...and we were full board :)

The pool is lovely with shaded and sunny spots. Several hammocks for snoozing. The beach is deserted, clean and the sea quite swimmable when we were there. We enjoyed the turtle related activities and watching the fishermen in what seemed quite a difficult community net pulling exercise!

Special shoutout to Tyron who gave us both the best massages. He is really gifted and thoughtful in his massage technique. Unforgettable.

The best bit is the five star cooked-to-order food, all freshly prepared and presented on site. Ranjan and his team worked wonders in the kitchen coming up with something to suit everyone, three meals a day. All with a smile.

And when we were there - I had asked him in advance about any turtle hatcheries nearby...that night we released freshly-hatched turtles from the beach. Truly a highlight of our trip.

It's not a touristy part of Sri Lanka, but the team will sort any visits out you want. Just don't expect to walk to a quaint local village.

For us, it was perfect. We were at the end of our visit. We wanted pure relaxation. And we got it.","A five star place to relax","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612378-d1594900-r1004568670-Max_Wadiya-Ambalangoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We began our days sipping mango juice and freshly brewed coffee, ending them by releasing new-born turtle hatchlings into the sea under fuchsia skies. The vast, lush gardens are teeming with wildlife. On our last day we woke up to air fragranced with sandalwood from new year celebrations, jasmine, and salt from the Indian Ocean. What the owners have built here is not just a beautiful private home, it is a family – a community of life. Of all the places we have visited in our 40 years of travel, nothing has left us with unshakable memories quite like the Max Wadiya. Ranjan is a gifted manager, nothing is too much trouble, and the team – Indika, Chandima, Thanndu, Roshan, Sarath, and Mendis – are so warm and welcoming. The food, the food…! Deeply flavourful curries, lobster on the beach, fat river prawns doused with homemade garlic butter…meals made with soul and spirit. If you are a stressed-out executive looking to recharge, a large multigenerational family (up to 10), or a honeymoon couple – the Max Wadiya will have something for you. Pad barefoot across pristine sands for a morning swim in the sea, lounge in hammocks nestled in the coconut grove, settle into a post-lunch Ayurvedic massage, or frolic in the aquamarine pool (a good size for swimming laps). All in the privacy of a sanctuary under 2-hours from Bandaranaike International, and 40m from the historic fort of Galle. Plenty of activities are on offer: visits to the famous mask museum, tea plantations, lagoon trips, jungle trekking, river bathing – and more. The suites are adjoined, but slightly separate from the main villa and feel self-contained. Worth mentioning they each have a little kitchenette with fridge. Mendis is the security guard who looks after the property at night, so you can rest easy. Don’t wait – book it! You’ll create lasting memories… and an experience that might just change your life.","A private, safe, and peaceful beachfront haven – simply paradise.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612378-d1594900-r946619437-Max_Wadiya-Ambalangoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I was worried our children who range from 9 to 4 would be bored as we booked the main villa for 12 days.  Not at all! We strolled on the beach and the children played in the pool for hours, hung out in the hammocks, made sandcastles and happily ran around the property.  Ranjan and his team organised a birthday breakfast for our son whilst we were there, which he loved.  We took a few trips up to the towns close by as they are also in easy reach from the property and for a longer trip to Galle, we booked a taxi.  But there was equally no need to leave!  Everything we needed was organised by Ranjan.  Nothing was too much trouble and so we barely had to think :-)  It was an amazing holiday and we all had a chance to unwind and relax.

There is so much to see and do!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This was my 8th time at the Max Wadiya and it seems to get better every time! 

For me - everything that makes a holiday exceptional comes together at the Max Wadiya. 

The beach on which the villa is set is perhaps the cleanest beach in Sri Lanka - and it almost seems like a private beach. 

One night when walking on the beach dinner we were fortunate enough to see a turtle coming in to lay eggs. The eggs were later rescued from dogs and poachers by the folks at Max Wadiya and kept in the hatchery near their swimming pool. 

Coming to the food served at the Max Wadiya, it is exceptional! Every meal is different, well presented and absolutely delicious! 

Finally, what makes Max Wadiya remarkable is the hospitality and graciousness shown to us by Ranjan and his staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They are unobtrusive, but always there to address any ask that you may have. 

Perhaps in this short note I have been able to convey why I have made a trip to Max Wadiya and integral part of my vacation calendar for the year.","Yet another outstanding vacation at the Max Wadiya!","2024-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612378-d1594900-r941595840-Max_Wadiya-Ambalangoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The location and grounds are fantastic, you are right at one of the best beaches on this stretch of coastline at your doorstep. You can peacefully relax by the pool or on a hammock under the many coconut trees in the tropical gardens, or just book in a massage or take in the sea breeze and sunsets.
Limited to about ten guests, Max Wadiya has a homely feel, unlike what many hotels offer. The villa that we stayed in was spacious with all the amenities. The excellent staff will go through any lengths to make your stay great, and are at your behest from the time you check in. 
The food was delicious, we enjoyed several of our meals under the gazebo. From breakfast to dinner, the kitchen will comply with your menu requests wherever possible.

I took advantage of the complimentary Yoga which again was 1st class and I even did a great woodland walk with the charming and knowledgeable Dinesh who came all the way from Columbo for it. If that's not 5* service I don't know what is! Larry and his team looked after me we well and the food and restaurant setting was superb.

From arrival to departure we had the best hospitality from everyone at Glenross.

We stayed at the Cinnamon Pool Villa and there are no words to describe it. It was very spacious, with the bedroom and bathroom on the top level, and a separate tv lobby and plunge pool on the lower level. The plunge pool has a beautiful view, especially towards evening.
Everything was very clean and well organized. Upali and the housekeeping team has done an excellent job. They also quickly helped us when a sudden rain wet the floor because the sliding doors were open.

Upon check-in we were offered a complimentary shoulder massage as well as a complimentary yoga session for the morning (this is also quite good to experience, even for someone who hasn't done yoga at all).
Ajith, Rathnayake, Kapila, Chamath, and all other staff members provided the most friendly hospitality and catered to all our needs promptly (especially thankful to them and Chef Nimal for finding Omeprazole for my acid reflux close to midnight).

The food is quite simply delicious. For full board, there is a set menu with a nice variety to choose from. Chef Nimal, Upul, Tharindu, and Ranjith have done an excellent job when it comes to the dishes and each meal was absolutely great.

The environment and ambience of the entire hotel is truly remarkable. It feels like disconnecting from your daily life and completely moving to another realm. The design concepts blend very well with the environment and for me it was a magical experience especially when it rains. The surrounding greenery takes an entirely different appearance during rain.

Before leaving we also had the pleasure of talking with Mr. Shamil, the General Manager. Kudos to Mr. Shamil for managing such a nice hotel where guests can feel extremely relaxed and comfortable as well as disconnect from their daily lives for a while.

Glenross Living is truly an absolutely remarkable experience that resembles a lifestyle more than the average stay at a hotel and we definitely plan to return someday.","A Truly  Relaxing Stay in Kalutara","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r956598299-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your wonderful review and for choosing to spend even a day with us in paradise—it means so much to hear that your brief stay left such a lasting impression.
We’re thrilled that you enjoyed the breathtaking ocean views from your upstairs room and found it to be the perfect spot to unwind. It’s always rewarding to know when our guests find that sense of peace and serenity we aim to provide.
Your kind words about our team truly warm our hearts. Dilhara and the rest of the team will be delighted to know that their care and attention helped make your experience so memorable. We believe it’s those small, thoughtful touches—like the foot massage and personalised service—that help create truly special moments.
We're also glad to hear that you enjoyed the food, especially paired with the soothing soundtrack of the sea. There’s nothing quite like dining by the ocean to help you truly relax and disconnect.
Thank you once again for your glowing recommendation. It would be our absolute pleasure to welcome you back for a longer stay next time—you’ll always have a place here to unwind and feel at home.

We only had the chance to experience this place for a day, but it left us wanting more 
The location the hotel is built on is superb, with unmatched views of the ocean in all directions

We stayed at the upstairs room which I think is the better choice compared to the more costly room with a pool in the downstairs.
The staff really took this place to the next level, offering the best care, and going out of their way to make the experience more memorable 

The food too , was excellent. Enjoying the meals while enjoying the calming waves of the sea, was so enjoyable. Also the complimentary brief  foot massage they provided was a nice touch.

It’s the peaceful vibe of this hotel , that makes this place such a great place to relax and unwind, detaching yourself from the world around.

B. den Sonnenuntergang zu verfolgen, was auch aus dem großen Pool möglich ist. 
Das Appartement selbst ist sehr gepflegt und großzügig. Auch hier, ein Teil des Bades hat kein  Dach, so dass man bei warmen Regen  in der großen Wanne sitzen kann. 
Das Essen ist gut (wir hatten Halbpension) und man kann bei Frühstück und Abendessen zwischen lokalen und westlichen Gerichten wählen.
Der Bereich für Wellness Behandlungen sind nur überdacht unter sonst freiem Himmel und haben wir gleich mehrfach genossen. 
Das Personal ist wie überall in SL sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, man hat während des Aufenthalts einen persönlichen Butler. Englischkenntnisse sind Voraussetzung zur Verständigung, das Hotel ist nur für Erwachsene. 
Auf jeden Fall ist das Hotel empfehlenswert, wenn man einen ruhigen, stilvollen Strandurlaub genießen möchte.

We were surprised to find we got our own butler for our stay. You are given a small mobile phone to contact them for anything at all you may need.
Our Butler, Niroshan, was amazing and was always there to greet us when we went for breakfast and dinner. He even set up our floating breakfast in the pool which was beautiful!

The villa was really spacious and had all the amenities you could want for your stay. We stayed in a few different locations in Sri Lanka and Jetwing was the only place where the air conditioning actually kept the room sufficiently cool in the heat and humidity!

There is access to both beaches either side with security making us feel extra safe. The beaches were both amazing and very quiet, often only another couple or 2 to share them with.

We were here for my birthday and they had decorated the bed and gave us a cake at dinner which was much appreciated!","Stunning pool villa with beach view","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r1000910048-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughtful feedback on your second visit to Jetwing Saman Villas. We are thrilled to hear that you loved the experience during your first visit in January 2023 and decided to return for another stay.
We’re glad to know you enjoyed the unique atmosphere of our property, with its stunning views and the spacious villa-like rooms. We truly appreciate your kind words about the bathtub and the outdoor veranda. However, we do understand your concern regarding the step between areas, and we will certainly consider this feedback to improve the comfort of our guests.
It’s great to hear that you were able to relax and enjoy the complimentary foot massage at our spa and the lovely pool. We’re also pleased that you found our beach location and dining area to your liking.
We appreciate your honest comments regarding the dinner. We sincerely apologise for the 30-minute gap between courses and the quality of the cocktails. Your feedback has been passed along to our culinary team for further review, as we aim to provide a seamless and delightful dining experience for all of our guests.
Regarding the breakfast, we are glad you enjoyed the massive spread, but we regret that it did not meet the same high standards you experienced during your first visit. We will definitely look into this and work to ensure that the flavors remain consistent across all visits.
We also appreciate your recognition of our young, enthusiastic team.
Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback. We are delighted that your stay was overall pleasant and relaxing, and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon. We hope to exceed your expectations during your next visit.

We visited this property in Jan 2023 and loved the experience, so we decided to visit again. 

This review is on the second visit. 

This boutique hotel is situated on a slightly rocky outcrop giving it a different vibe from a typical beach hotel and offering spectacular views. 

The rooms are more like villas, with an outside veranda, a living cum bed room and a spacious bathroom. My favorite part was the tub with the semi open roof. (But was not a fan of the small step separating each area as it was difficult to get used to on a short visit).

They have a nice looking spa where we got a 15 minute complimentary foot massage and a lovely pool. There are two large stretches of clean public beaches on either side of the property. The dining area too is quite spacious.

The dinner was a set menu. The appetizer and the soup was rather ordinary. The mains were pretty good though. But there was about a 30 minute gap between each course which was surprsing considering it was a set menu with 3-4 options. The real let down were the cocktails which were quite watery. 

The breakfast we had on our previous visit was one of the best we've had anywhere. There were only two choices, local or western but there was a whole series of dishes under each option and the flavors were spot on. This time, while the spread was still the same massive spread and the food was good, the flavors didn't come up to the high standards set last time. 

The staff were very young, very pleasant and very enthusiastic. But we missed the subtle professionalism of the more senior staff we met last time.
 
All in all it was a rather pleasant and relaxing experience. We would have given it 5 stars if not for the very high bar set on our previous visit.

Firstly let me take this opportunity to thank you for choosing us again for your birthday celebration - it truly means the world to us when guests return to Sigiriya Water Garden. Your loyalty as a returning guest is something we deeply value.

I am delighted that you enjoyed the peaceful, serene atmosphere of our property and that the Deluxe Pool Villa met your expectations. 
A huge thank you for your kind words about Lahiru your Butler. I know he will be absolutely thrilled to hear how much his friendly and attentive service meant to you during your stay. Comments like these really make his day and ours too. 

I do want to sincerely apologize for the mix-up with your reservation, particularly regarding the early check-in request. I believe what may have happened is that when your booking got amended, some of your special requests - including the note about this being a birthday celebration and your second visit - may have gotten miscommunicated along the way. This is absolutely not the experience we want for any guest, especially someone celebrating a special occasion with us. I am disappointed that we did not properly acknowledge your birthday or your return visit from the very beginning. We should have made your celebration feel extra special right from check-in.

Thank you for the honest feedback about our reservation process. It is invaluable input that helps us improve and I will be working with our team to ensure these communication gaps don't happen again.

We would love to welcome you back for your next getaway. Please do contact me directly on gm@watergardensigiriya.com when you have planned your next visit so I can add some special touches to your next stay.

While the property remains beautiful and peaceful — perfect for a relaxing getaway — the experience this time had some disappointments.

The reservation officer was not helpful when we requested an early check-in, which made our arrival less welcoming than expected. Moreover, despite mentioning that this was a special occasion and our second stay, there was no effort from the team to acknowledge or make the celebration memorable, which was a letdown.

On the positive side, the location is calm and serene, ideal for a quiet retreat. A special mention must go to Lahiru, our butler, who was very friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well taken care of throughout the stay. His excellent service really stood out.

The food was great, with a good variety and quality. We stayed in a Deluxe Pool Villa, which was spacious, clean, and beautifully maintained — a true highlight of the stay.

Overall, while the property and on-ground service (especially by Lahiru) are commendable, the reservation process and guest consideration could definitely be improved, especially for returning guests celebrating special occasions.","Beautiful Location and Villa, but Disappointed with Reservation Experience","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r1013064544-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

This hotel easily makes it into our top 3 of all time. From start to finish, our stay was outstanding.

We originally booked for three nights and left feeling it just wasn’t enough. After a disappointing experience at our next hotel, we made the easy decision to return—and ended up staying four more nights. It was even better the second time around.

Many travellers seem to use this as a short stopover, but we’re so glad we took the time to stay longer. During our first visit, we were busy with excursions and barely scratched the surface of what the resort offers. On our return, we truly relaxed—and had the chance to enjoy the incredible spa, serene pool area, and the warm, attentive hospitality.

The villas are spacious, private, and beautifully appointed. The staff are outstanding—welcoming, professional, and genuinely kind, from the front desk to the restaurant team. The food is excellent, with a wide variety from local specialities to international favourites—everything was delicious.

The grounds are simply magical. Wildlife is everywhere, and it’s like watching a live nature documentary unfold around you. Any bird lovers could stay here and see everything from eagles to crocodiles.

Oh WOW...................What an absolutely stunning review to wake up to!!! Your kind words have truly made our entire team's day. It is indeed reviews like yours that remind us why we are so passionate about what we do. I am so thrilled that you had such a magical experience with us. Reading about how enchanted you were from the moment you arrived just fills my heart with joy. That is exactly the kind of feeling we hope every guest takes away from their stay at Water Garden Sigiriya. 

I will make sure to share your kind sentiments with our Butlers, Udara and Dinuka. It seems that they both worked their magic on you. We are incredibly lucky to have such dedicated team members who genuinely care about making each guest feel special. Our peacocks definitely know how to grab attention and put on a show. It is always a delight when guests fall in love with our feathered residents as much as we have. I am delighted that we were able to hit the mark with our food and villas. 

The fact that you are already planning your return visit is the highest compliment we could ask for. It was a pleasure having you over and thank you for taking the time to share experience. We truly cannot wait to welcome you back to our little slice of paradise in Sigiriya.

First and foremost, a huge thank you to Udara and Dinuka, who took care of us throughout the trip. Their warm hospitality, attention to detail, and genuine care made us feel incredibly welcome and pampered. They went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed and more – we truly felt like royalty!

The location is absolutely stunning – serene, lush, and beautifully designed. It felt like a hidden paradise surrounded by nature, with the iconic Sigiriya Rock just a short distance away. One of the most delightful surprises was the abundance of beautiful peacocks roaming freely across the property – an absolute treat to see them up close in such a tranquil setting.

The food was amazing – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Every meal felt like a celebration of Sri Lankan cuisine and international flavors, with a great variety that catered to all tastes.

Our room was super cozy and luxurious, with modern comforts and a beautiful view. The blend of rustic charm and contemporary elegance was perfect – it was the kind of space you never wanted to leave.

Thanks so much for sharing your wonderful feedback about your stay with us. We are indeed thrilled to read that you enjoyed our natural surroundings and the wildlife. Our peacocks tend to be a natural wake-up call both when you need it and also when you do not yet they add such character to our little slice of paradise in Sigiriya. We are delighted that you loved our superior deluxe villa with the private plunge pool. They are one of our unique features and sell out fast. Great to also hear that we hit the spot with our dining options.

This personalised culinary initiative allows guests to collaborate with our Executive Chef Ruwan and craft a dinner menu of their choice. Through this bespoke service, guests have the opportunity to share their personal preferences with us and our expert chefs carefully curate a customized menu tailored to their tastes and also incorporating dietary constrains. Our commitment to culinary excellence ensures that every dish is prepared with the finest ingredients and presented with exceptional attention to detail.

We hope to see you back again on your next visit to Sri Lanka.

Thank you for sharing your wonderful experience with us at Water Garden Sigiriya. We are absolutely delighted that you enjoyed your stay in our superior deluxe villa with private plunge pool. These villas are firm favourites with most of our guests. 

We are thrilled that you were able to experience some of our wellness offerings! Rikki, our Swedish head of Wellness who handles the Yoga and Meditation classes sends you his warm wishes together with Maria and Ayu, our Balinese Spa Therapists. I cannot help but  chuckle about your wildlife photography adventure - getting muddy for the perfect shot is definitely dedication! 

We are particularly happy that you found the balance between relaxation and exploration, taking advantage of both our peaceful surroundings and the area's attractions like the Sigiriya Lion Rock.

Thank you again for selecting to stay with us and we love to welcome you back soon, perhaps with a spare change of clothes for those enthusiastic photographer moments.

The view of the beach to the balcony and from the pool is superb, the food was very good and tasty and the chef has some good cooking skills. Very clean and the staff who was there to clean and serve were well trained, well disciplined and very helpful. Superb place and because of the service we received and the beauty of the place we stayed in the next door villa which belong to them as well the following weekend with 14 of my friends @ the South Point Ocean Villa.

We came for 7 nights, then extended for another 2 nights and then for another 5 nights.

You have enough privacy, great swimming pool, clean beach with easy access to the sea and a perfectly trained staff that knows what makes your holiday perfect.

RANJAN is the magic word; the word that guarantees if there is any problem, it will be fixed. 

What deserves special attention? Tuk-tuk driver is great (ask Ranjan). Transport from any place (ask Ranjan). You have a healt issue (Ranjan solves it). Fishing, snorkeling or diving, best massage or yoga, any wishes? Ask Ranjan!

Food is more than perfect (wish anything and ask Ranjan). Curry and the salads! OMG!

Small local market on Wednesdays (1 min walk from MW). Fishermans market (early morning): for nine USD (9,00 USD) you get 3 kg barracuda. Hairdresser for less than one USD (1,00 USD) in front of the main entrance to MW. Snorkelling, fishing, diving: ask Ranjan (PADI Hikkaduwa recommended). Changing money (USD or EUR) for SL rupee? Ask Ranjan (best rate, believe me!) 

Finally: personalised, great value, clean property, profesional attitude. Recommended!

PS: Jungle Paradise for safari (ca 2,5 hours by car) perfect spot!

The rooms, garden and pool are all fabulous and the beach which is accessible outside was empty apart from a number of local children playing nearby. I would suggest to anyone to stay here if you are looking for a peaceful retreat, but with easy access to nearby town of Hikkaduwa should you wish. Special mention must go to Ranjan and the staff here who couldn't do enough for us. Ranjan even gave me a lift in the rain to nearby Ambalongoda on one occasion so i could get a couple of beers from the shop. Him and his staff really make this place special. We were also lucky enough to release some turtles in to the sea on our first evening. From what I gather, the team here will protect the eggs until they hatch and ensure they are released in a natural and non-intrusive way. Also - we had the same tuk-tuk driver every day who would take us to Hikkaduwa or nearby mask museum - i didn't catch his name but he appeared to be a friend of the hotel and was incredibly friendly and kind.

The staff is fulfilling every wish before you finished thinking it. Ranshin who is the staff leader and the manager of the property is a great cook and is asking you every day for your special demands. We enjoyed every evening a different dinner and ate on different places (in the garden, on the balcony or in the Villa). Fresh juices, fruits, and vegetables whatever the Sri Lankan kitchen could provide, Ranshin was able to serve it.
We can recommend this place also because it is not in a highly frequented touristic area. Ambalangoda is more surrounded by nice  local people with some other holiday apartments around but close to shops or neighbor-citys if you are looking for offers for tourists like snorkeling, diving or other things.
Max Wadiya has its own beach area whats wonderful and quiet. No beach boys around what was one of the best news we got. Wheather in October was better than in April. The humidity wasn't that high, but some rainy hours we had. Bit I think thats normal for October. Overall it was great wheather and we could enjoy a lot of things in the sun.
We can say it worth every penny we paid and thats why we give this location 5 points.

Our last 4 days were spent at Max Wadiya.  We had day trips planned but canceled because we could not bring ourselves to leave Max Wadiya, Ranjan (manager) and his team.  The family villa, beach and pool are stunning.  We had the beach to ourselves- so peaceful and beautiful.  My kids loved body surfing the waves.  When the waves became more intense they were off to the pool which is quite large.  We also had the pool to ourselves as no-one else was booked during our stay. :)   I can’t possibly say enough about Ranjan and his team.  Kind, gracious and incredible cooks.  Ranjan happily accommodated my children when they were craving western foods and they loved his cooking.  My husband and I enjoyed the Sri Lankan dishes which were fresh, plentiful, always different and beyond delicious.  The best meals we had on our trip hands down were all at Max Wadiya.  Our kids watched turtles hatch with Ranjan and later helped to release them into the sea at sundown- twice!  Those memories will last a lifetime for them.  Ranjan is so kind, interesting and easy to talk to.  We all miss him!   Last but certainly not least, Ruth Max, the owner, could not have been more helpful when I was planning this trip for my family.  Sri Lanka is the farthest I have traveled with my children to date.  She went above and beyond to help and quickly eased my nerves.  Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with the kindest people (they love kids) and there is SO much to see.  Max Wadiya was the perfect end point to relax on the beach before heading back to the airport.  I only wish we had more than 4 nights there.  Go and let Ranjan and his team spoil you.

On an island with no scarcity of luxury hotels, boutique or otherwise, Max Wadiya stands out on so many counts. With accommodation for no more than four sets of guests, the atmosphere is that of a private home rather than a hotel. Bring your own alcohol if you wish, but everything else is included in the price: meals, drinks, service by the pool, on the beach, in your suite or in the garden, wherever and whenever you want it. No irritating chit signing for the smallest indulgence! The large sea water pool is refreshingly cool by Sri Lankan standards; the  beach (effectively private if not officially so) directly borders the garden; meals are served in individual pagodas under the palm trees; the view over the sea at sunset is spectacular; the food is prepared to your own taste by the chef/manager himself, and to a standard unsurpassed in our experience of nine hotels on our twenty-eight day tour of the island; and the friendly and personal service afforded by all the staff is a constant reminder of just how lucky one has been to have discovered Max Wadiya.

From the minute the four of us arrived, we were made to feel completely at home by Ranjan, the manager and his team.   Nothing is too much trouble, but their attention is relaxed and unobtrusive.   Ranjan helped facilitate our tuk tuk adventures to Galle and other local sights, and the masseur who, we all agreed was exceptional.   Every meal, cooked with fresh local produce, was outstanding and as Ranjan got to know our individual preferences, he surpassed himself by coming up with new and delicious dishes each day.   If you get the chance, a cookery lesson with Ranjan is a must.  The accommodation is very comfortable and the salt water pool and garden are an oasis of nature, colour and beauty.   From there a small gate leads you on to the most beautiful, deserted beach, total paradise!  As if that isn't enough, there is a small turtle hatchery on the property, where eggs rescued/bought from the local fishermen, are incubated in the sand until hatched and ready for release.   Ranjan tried to wake us one night to witness a turtle laying her eggs on the beach, but sadly we slept on oblivious.  At least we were able to help with the burial of her eggs the next day.    To me this summed up the whole Max Wadiya experience, the kindness of Ranjan and his team, means you leave a little bit of your heart here.   I completely understand why so many people return - hopefully we will too.","MAXimum Praise!","2019-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612378-d1594900-r653648168-Max_Wadiya-Ambalangoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your experience. We’re delighted that you enjoyed our friendly staff, cozy beachfront location, and the amazing Kumana safari we organized for you. Providing a smooth arrival with a taxi from Colombo Airport and early check-in at 2-3 AM was our pleasure.

We’d like to clarify that while we allowed an early check-in as a courtesy,a complimentary night, this did not include a complimentary Breackfast. Upon arrival, we informed you that breakfast for that night was not included, as we had already arranged a free Kumana park booking and assisted with your taxi reservation.

Regarding the food selection, please note that we do not advertise ourselves as an Asian restaurant. We are an Italian restaurant and pizzeria, and this is clearly mentioned in our menu, website, and reviews. While we do offer some local flavors, our focus remains on authentic Italian cuisine.

As for the hot water, we appreciate your understanding. As an eco-friendly resort, we aim to respect nature and resources. While most guests find it unnecessary in our warm climate, we are evaluating options to introduce hot water in the future.

We regret any miscommunication regarding breakfast details and will ensure even more clarity in the future. However, we’re happy to hear that your overall stay was great and that you would recommend our resort for a beachfront getaway with easy access to Kumana park.

We hope to welcome you again soon!

Best regards,
Nicola

Op verzoek werd gekookt wat je maar wilt. En dat op het hoogste niveau! Wij kozen steeds voor Aziatisch. Het was een waanzinnige culinaire ervaring. 

We hadden een avond met live muziek, speciaal voor ons geregeld, omdat het oud en nieuw was. Het diner was buiten aan het speciaal verlichte zwembad.

Nestled in a green oasis, it offers the perfect retreat for those seeking peace. At the same time, it is a logistically ideal starting point to explore the beauties of this impressive island, Sri Lanka, and is surrounded by many attractive and interesting highlights. The journey to the sea is also very short (15 minutes), and you can be taken to a beautiful beach by the Maya team at any time upon request.
The “Maya” offers accommodation of the highest standard with its 5 beautiful rooms. The rooms are perfectly equipped, and the large beds allow for heavenly sleep. The entire property is in top condition and is lovingly tended daily by the Maya team.
Culinary service at the “Maya” is provided at the highest level, allowing you to enjoy everything from traditional and typical local dishes to any international cuisine style. The highly developed degree and extraordinary willingness and flexibility of the kitchen team to personalize made my Ayurveda stay a special experience.
The entire “Maya” team is passionate about making the guest happy and satisfied. Every wish is practically read from the guest's eyes, and as a guest, you are unobtrusively the center of attention in every aspect. Whether in the resort or outside on trips and excursions, the team is always there, very helpful, competent, and above all, very friendly.
Special mention should be made of the many massages and Ayurveda treatments that I enjoyed every day. Nadee masters all therapies and treatments perfectly, and for me, these were the best massages of my life.
All in all, Maya is a perfect combination of location, architecture, luxurious facilities, high-level service, and cuisine, and it impresses above all with the friendliness and competence of the team. A true insider tip – I will definitely come back.","A Paradise","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11908054-d2205148-r984835720-Maya_Tangalle-Beliatta_Southern_Province.html",

This stunning place, with its British and Dutch influences, is beautifully restored and offers a real sense of luxury.

What really makes Maya Tangalle stand out is its connection to nature, with open spaces and views of the surrounding paddy fields.

Mornings at Maya are incredibly peaceful, like a calm start to the day. The staff attention to detail is impressive, and their genuine smiles make the stay even more enjoyable.

The property itself is simply divine, with stunning views and a well maintained, charming rural setting. The food was outstanding.

Though it’s bit away from the beach, it’s only a 20 minute drive to  Hiriketiya Beach, one of the best in the south for swimming and surfing, with plenty of restaurants to relax at afterwards. It is the perfect mix of beach fun and returning to comfort.

Maya Tangalle is in a clam and tranquil area, perfect for unwinding . The rooms were spotless and very comfortable, and the staff were amazing friendly, experienced and always willing to go the extra mile. 

One small downside is the distance from the beach, but the nearby attractions make up for it. Yala and Udawalawe National Parks are just two hours away, offering an incredible wildlife experience.

Special thanks to Prashan, the property manager , the executive chef and the entire team for their outstanding hospitality.","Maya Tangalle ; a serene luxury retreat amidst nature!","2024-07","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11908054-d2205148-r966093118-Maya_Tangalle-Beliatta_Southern_Province.html",

The rooms are clean and cozy, though smaller than expected. Heaters in the rooms were a welcome feature, but they didn’t always function properly, which was a bit disappointing given the cold climate.

The heated swimming pool was one of the main attractions, but unfortunately, the pool heaters weren’t working properly during our stay. This made it difficult to fully enjoy the pool, especially in the chilly weather.

The food, on the other hand, was excellent—flavorful and well-presented, easily one of the highlights of the stay. Service overall was good, although the initial welcome lacked the warmth and hospitality usually experienced at similar resorts. That said, the staff were polite and accommodating throughout the visit.

As for the views, while the surroundings are peaceful, they didn’t quite live up to the picturesque scenes described in the property’s promotions.

We were lucky to be there during the Tamil-Sinhalese New Year, and the staff had arranged an entire celebration. From traditional snacks to fun local games, they made us feel like a part of the festivities, not just guests.

Special thanks to the amazing team—Lakishan, Kieshan, Mr. Raj, Mr. Jim, and Chef Mono—you all made our stay so special. Super polite, warm, and helpful throughout. The dinner and breakfast were both brilliant too!

Where you can't stop taking photos! 

We stayed for 10 nights which we was longer than most, probably people visit for a few days which probably would be best. 

We took a long taxi to get here fome colombo! Took us 8 hours. Arranged by the resort which was very helpful and efficient. 

The cabanas - we took a risk with no air con as the fans and sea breeze we thought would be sufficient, unfortunately it was sweltering hot.  We had a lower cabana which doesn't have ceiling fans but has the standing fans...it was so so hot that sleep was difficult.. this heat is nothing the resort can do about of course and I understand and agree with the owner that air con isn't good for the planet ..so I totally get it. But its important to note how hot we felt in case this will be an issue for you..it was for us and did affect our enjoyment.  I ended up with a heat rash half way through the holiday!:( 

This said Anna was SO accommodating and moved us to an upper cabana when they were free, she did this without charge and we definitely felt cooler in an upper cabana as they have ceiling fans and higher ceilings.. so I'd recommend if going when hot to book an upper cabana..plus the view is nicer and feels more private. 

They also gave us an extra fan to help. 

The cabanas are comfy though, beds were nice comfy pillows, kept very clean and a nice bathroom:)

The beach is completely deserted, so our walks were usually just us..in paradise.  Important to add..the waves in the sea, it is a surf point of course, are powerful so you can't swim or float..you can jump about in the waves which is fun just is quite tiring ha ha as you can't relax as such. ;) 

It's great breakfast is included and it's tasty..the menu is mainly Italian and its OK, some of the dishes are a little strange in flavour and personally I didn't think all worked and we really really would have loved more local food.  We had sri lankan curry one night and it was fantastic! But then the chef didn't want to cook it again:( I think this is a real shame..as its lots of pizza and pasta.  The pizzas are amazing though ..the best pizza I've ever tasted.  But we were dissapointed we only got sri lankan food once at thw resort.  But I guess for those travelling around Sri Lanka it's a lovely great If they've only been eating sri lankan.

The staff are incredible here...Harry and the other man who worked in the evening with him plus the man who cleaned the rooms..everyone was so kind, so polite, such helpful joyful people and we absolutely loved their company and help.  They work really hard and can't do enough for you. 

Harry you're wonderful! 

Nicola the owner is great, really interesting to talk to, helpful and a real passion for the paradise he's created.  Anna is also very very helpful and kind..and runs lovely yoga classes.  I'd add that I wish we'd been told about the mediation schedule when we arrived as we would have joined every morning but didn't get shown it until 3 days before we left.  More mediation would be wonderful.:)

Overall this place is paradise..I loved it..but the lack of air con was a real challenge for us BUT we did know there was none so  there's no fault of the resort..just wanted to forewarn others if going when it's hot. 

Definitely go if you're visiting sri lanka !! It's like a retreat..just go, get under the coconut palms, listen to the waves and birds.  

Thanks to the whole team for being amazing","It's beautiful 😍","2024-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d20113947-r950069116-Whisky_Point_Resort-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",

The cabanas are tastefully decorated with attention to detail, high quality linens, and utmost consideration to make it very Eco friendly. The rooms and entire property were extremely clean. The breakfast was good and we had our meals on the property which were delicious. The pizzas were great.
The pagodas scattered throughout the property are great and we enjoyed relaxing in them. The entire team were courteous and did an excellent job. 
We did a trip to the Kumana Park, Anna recommended a beautiful nature area where we spent an evening spotting allegators, elephants and beautiful birds. The beach is pristine and we had it to ourselves. We walked endless miles soaking in the beauty and watch the fishermen pulling their nets in with their catch of fish. A stay at this resort is a great option on a vacation to Sri Lanka.  Keep up the great work Anna and Team. Transportation to and from was arranged by the resort and we were very happy with the arrangements.","A True Gem off the Beaten Path","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d20113947-r944549059-Whisky_Point_Resort-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",

Was I wrong! It so far exceeded any expectations or any description written in these reviews that it’s impossible to put into words. I don’t even think the photos, as good as they are, do it justice. And, none of the rating categories go high enough…six or seven stars might be sufficient. But I’ll give it a go….

Even before we got there, I was impressed with Ruth’s friendly and professional management skills preparing us for our stay. She even called from France while we were there to make sure we were satisfied. And, upon arrival, everything was handled with speedy efficiency overlaid with Sri Lankan grace and smiling hospitably. Ranjan and his exceptional staff greeted us and brought us to our room, the blue suite (which again exceeds any description given here or by the hotel). It is spacious and comfortable and has a charming view from the balcony overlooking the lush landscape and out to the Indian Ocean. The Blue Suite is definitely sweet…however, both of the other suites look terrific, too. 

Everything about Max Wadiya is magical:  the accommodations, the grounds, the gorgeously endless empty beach. But wait there’s more. On New Year’s Day, at the last notice, masterful Ranjan arranged massages for both of us. Because it was so last minute, he had to use a back up masseuse, whose name I think, was Darshan (I’m sure I’m getting this wrong — my apologies). All I can say is if he was the back up, the regulars should watch out! He should be a regular for Max Wadiya. I’ve had hundreds of massages all over the world and this was one of the very best.

And then, there’s the food. Ranjan is a gourmet chef par excellence and designs the menu and works with his staff to deliver the best Sri Lanken food we had during our three weeks in the marvelous country of Sri Lanka. The culinary experience itself is worth the stay and is beyond compare. We didn’t get to do this but I would advise folks to spend long enough at Max Wadiya to take the cooking courses that Ranjan offers.

I could go on for pages but this is probably already too much. I do have to include the incredibly friendly and winsome staff that really makes the whole experience come together. Everyone is terrific and always available but never hovering — perfect in their invisible but constant presence. Always with a smile. Always gracious. Everyone made us feel welcome and they all deserve special mention:  Tharindu, Harsha, Chandma, Roshan, Indika, and, the cook, Prasanna. And, of course, Ranjan, who always went out of his way to include us and welcome us and make us feel comfortable every minute we were there. Thank you Ranjan!!!

We only stayed four nights and wish it had been weeks or a month. We will find a way to return.

... Our best surprise was to be woken our first day before 7 a.m.by Ranjan, the hotel manager, to be told the turtles were hatching from eggs buried in the sand as part of a conservation project. And there they were - dozens of tiny creatures waving their tiny flippers as they dug their way up and blinked the grains of sand off their eyes. We scooped them up into a big blue plastic tub filled with water and later helped Ranjan release them at sunset on the beach - giving them a chance to swim to deeper waters overnight. 
But that was just an extra - Ranjan and his team made us feel welcome throughout.
They made some of the best curries ever - with ingredients we'd never tasted - straight from the local vegetable and fish markets.
Max Wadiya was the highlight of a 10-day trip to Sri Lanka. And if there's a Tripadvisor competition for the most charming manager Ranjan gets our vote.

Every part of every stay has been a delight. And as always, putting our trust in Ranjan, the manager, to find the best raw materials available at the market on any given day paid off with one memorable dinner feast after another (all inclusive, by the way). 

Rather that repeating the praise that we, and others, routinely heap upon Max Wadiya, Ranjan and the crew, this time around we’d like to mention some of the other reasons we love to stay there.

The local town, Ambalangoda, is not (yet) overrun by tourists, unlike popular Hikkaduwa, just 15-20 minutes away by Tuk-Tuk. That means you can get whatever tourist services you need in Hikkaduwa, and then retreat to the unsullied charm of Ambalangoda.

On the beautiful beach right outside Max Wadiya’s lush and lovely grounds and infinity pool, you’re more likely to meet Sri Lankan fishermen at work or local kids playing volleyball than encounter another tourist. Join Ranjan for a trip to the local market, and you’ll see, hear and feel the real Sri Lanka. He also offers Sri Lankan cooking classes in the kitchen … at no extra charge.

Plus, there are such local attractions as the Ariyapala Mask Museum, Dudley Silva Batiks and the lovely Sri Vijayarama Viharaya Buddhist temple. Don’t miss the Community Tsunami Museum in Hikkaduwa about the 2004 tsunami that devastated much of the area. It almost moved us to tears. 

Max Wadiya is also an excellent base for day trips, and is only a couple hours (depending on traffic) from the Colombo airport.

On top of that, the hotel and its owners fund and run a sea turtle hatchery on the property. They buy up eggs from local fishermen to incubate in the sand and then point the hatchlings of these highly endangered species toward the nearby sea. Part of our daily tradition at Max Wadiya is the check out the hatchery in hopes of seeing newborn giant Green and Olive Ridley turtles

It’s not just Ranjan and his crew that make the place so special. It also everyone connected to it, from the Tuk-Tuk and car drivers they use to their regular masseur, who comes to their purpose-build massage pavilion upon request. 

Every time we arrive, we feel like we’re coming home.","Third visit and just as charmed!","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612378-d1594900-r559944913-Max_Wadiya-Ambalangoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I spent several days there and was welcomed as a queen by the kind and devoted staff. The houses and their decoration, the luxuriant park full of old trees and wonderful flowers, the birds chirping around within each thicket, the royal-blue swimming pool, the home-made delicious food cooked by the Chef. In the morning, I could not wait to enjoy the copious and tasty breakfast, sitting in the sun or under a majestic tree... Yes, everything is there to make you feel over the moon. I would particularly remember Prashanth's thoughtfulness and professionalism who, as a Head of staff, made everything he could to make me feel good. As a naturalist, I was also very touched by the staff's sensitivity and very happy to see that our discussions bear fruit: One day, a nestling fell into the swimming pool and I saved him in extremis. After I explained to the staff, he would fall again and most probably die if we did not move the nest further away from the water, everyone swung into action and moved the very heavy stone flower pot further into the park. On my advice, they even set up wind chimes around the swimming pool later on, in order to keep birds away and prevent them from drowning. I also know what the Villa leads environmental projects, among other things by planting trees.

The breakfasts were delicious and not only bountiful but also beautifully presented. We had dinner there on one of the nights and it was fabulous … the only criticism was that it was too much food but hubby didn’t complain. Most of the herbs and some veggies came from the hotel’s kitchen garden.

The service also excellent. The  and the whole was well cleaned and managed, view was amazing. Staff were also so friendly.
Hope to visit again and we are highly recommended this wonderful property.

The pizzas and pastas are a MUST try whilst you’re here (Nicola is Italian and he really knows good pizza and pasta!!) and if you give the chef previous notice, he was more than happy to cook some local Sri Lankan cuisines for us! Not to mention, breakfast each morning with a fresh juice always set us up for a good day!!

Anna is a fantastic yoga teacher and we loved getting up early, listening to the birds whilst enjoying a great yoga session! The beach is literally on your door step, and we went swimming in the ocean daily.

The place in itself is like a little oasis located on the beach. Our room was lovely and cozy, even though it didn't have AC the sea breeze along with the fan makes it cool and tempered at night. The food and drinks are simply amazing. Make sure you try some of their fresh smoothies while you are there, you won't regret it. If you like to surf you can just ask them to rent a board and you can take a 10 minute walk along the beach to Pottuvil Point.

Anna and Nico were always present for any advice and just for nice chats and games! Anna organised a safari for a group of us and a lovely walk to the most amazing views of Yala. We did an aerial yoga class with Anna which was so lovely in the Shala.
The staff worked super hard to keep the place pristine.
We're so happy to have found this place and would have stayed a lot longer if we could. I'd 100% recommend this place for pure relaxation. The beach was practically empty and so clean. Barely any rubbish as on other beaches we visited in Sri Lanka. 

Thank you so much Nico and Anna and I hope the 2 kittens Anna saved are ok!

Our apartment was on the second floor with a spacious wooden balcony where we could sit, read and enjoy the nature. The rooms are very clean and our bed was extremely cozy - we slept like baby’s in the fresh breeze coming from the ocean. 

The whiskey resort quickly felt like family. Nikola and Anna are wonderful and most caring hosts, always there to help and to provide their guests with a good time. We loved spending time with them in the cafe / restaurant where we often chilled, drank coffee, played or just chatted. Btw, the coffee tastes really good! Given Nikola’s Italian roots, the menu in the restaurant offers a delightful blend of Italian food (the past is just perfectly aldente :)) They further inspired us to do some day trips together with them, going to the elephant rock and doing a safari which were both wonderful nature experiences. After our time at whiskey point resort, we went to the south but very quickly started to miss it — we did not find a comparable place shaped by such good vibes, nice people and beautiful unpolluted nature.","Wonderful Idyll","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d20113947-r836865662-Whisky_Point_Resort-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",

We spent 3 nights here as part of our 3 week travelling around Sri Lanka. I booked on the basis of the wonderful reviews I had read and the place exceeded our expectations.

Nico and Anna are the most lovely hosts and go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable one. 

We stayed in a cabana which was simple but beautiful and kept immaculately clean. Lovely touches such as the hammock on the front balcony.

The food was delicious as were the fruit juices and milkshakes.

The resort is around 10/15 minutes out of Arugam Bay and set on a beautiful clean beach which we practically had to ourselves on most days. The sunrises and sunsets were stunning.

I tried the swing yoga with Anna in the morning- such fun and sets you up for the day. She also organised a jeep trip to Elephant Rock to watch the sunset and it was a lovely opportunity to chat to some of the other guests.

Would definitely recommend this place if you want to feel totally relaxed and looked after. Definitely felt like a home from home and we would stay again should we ever revisit Sri Lanka.

Thank you Nico and Anna and all the luck for the future.","A little piece of paradise","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d20113947-r835151541-Whisky_Point_Resort-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",

Our servers Nilmini  & Yohan kept us fed and entertained. Dining under the great canopy of the Nuga tree. Dazzeled by a dance of fire. Quenched by fresh Thambili. What more could you ask for a truely Sri lankan experience.

Thank you once again Nugagama for a wonderful meal.

We were lucky enough to be the only guests during our stay, and the experience felt incredibly personal and exclusive. The private beach just across the road was a lovely, quiet spot — a beautiful place to relax and take in the ocean views.

The staff were absolutely wonderful. They truly spoiled us – always warm, attentive, and thoughtful without being intrusive. Every interaction felt genuine, and nothing was ever too much trouble. It was clear they take great pride in making guests feel at home.

The villa and gardens are beautifully maintained, with colonial architecture and lush greenery. We had the pool entirely to ourselves throughout our stay, which made it feel all the more relaxing and luxurious. Our room was spacious, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable — a lovely mix of heritage and modern touches.

Breakfasts were generous and delicious, with fresh, flavourful options that started each day beautifully.

Sergeant House is a rare find — peaceful, full of character, and run with true care. It was the perfect place to slow down and enjoy the quiet, and we’ll always remember the calm and kindness we experienced here.","Serene, Stylish, and Full of Heart – A Special Stay at Sergeant House","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r1008051840-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We stayed for six nights in February 2025.

The management and staff are so professional and do their utmost to ensure a happy stay. The rooms with one caveat (see below) are superb, as is the swimming pool and the grounds. It is a peaceful oasis just off the busy road that tracks the coast.

It is a small hotel which is something we like - the pool never gets crowded and the service is personal. 

Dinner in the hotel is excellent. It has to be ordered before 11am and the chef will prepare dishes not on the menu (we had delicious grilled fish on our last night). We also ate out at the nearby Kabala Sunset and Sun n Sea plus the Dumpling House in Galle. All were good.

The lady providing massages onsite was brilliant and reasonably priced. I did the hotel's suggested bike tour around the local lagoon and coconut husk/rope making 'factory' which was hugely enjoyable and easy (despite the gear-less bike) thanks to the brilliant guide.

Caveat: Think carefully before booking the Cave Room. It is small and the second single bed is up some steep stairs. We are in our seventies and it was not really suitable for us.  Fortunately there were some empty rooms for some of the nights and the hotel manager made everything perfect so a very big thank you to her.","First Class: Impeccable","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r996741287-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Sergeant House in Unawatuna has a really laid-back yet stylish vibe. The staff are incredibly welcoming, and there’s a super homely feeling to the place, When you enter the property from a busy road you can’t believe how quiet the space is and how you feel in the middle of nature.

The swimming pool is perfectly formed for the number of guests and the sunbeds that sit within the pool itself are a lovely touch. There are small jacuzzi style pools around the grounds too.

The manager, Chathuri, was so helpful from the moment we made our booking. We wanted to travel by train from Colombo to Galle - she suggested which train to book and arranged for a van to meet us at Galle Station. She also organised our onward transport by van to our next destination - Yala. Tuk tuks were arranged for when we took a day trip to Galle. We were also able to enjoy a personal cooking class with the Sergeant House chef.
The food is a highlight. We were especially lucky to be treated to amazing Christmas Day breakfast and dinner (and gifts!)
The staff are outstanding. A small dedicated team who are professional, helpful and friendly.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so memorable. We would love to return

The staggering façade comes courtesy of its historic colonial architecture that traces all the way back to the 1800s; and its interiors characterized by a disarming confluence of rattan accents, antique decor, and traditional furniture that sets the tone of a perfect coastal vibe.

Lest you think it’s all face and no substance, you’ll be chuffed to learn that the folks at Sergeants’ House also offers exemplary service by any standards, and were very warm, accommodating and easy going. There was also something comfortingly communal about the fact that the room doors don’t lock (the family staying right across me literally left the doors wide open the entire day); and there was not a second throughout my stay that I got worried or paranoid that my things would get stolen, by staff or the other occupants. And that says ALOT because I am generally a very distrusting person  – especially when I am travelling. Something about the place works on a very unspoken level of intrinsic trust, and you get cloaked with the same kind understanding the instant you walk through its tall heavy gates, like magic.","This Stay Perfected Unawatuna For Me","2025-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r991669122-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Once you enter the beautiful gardens, you feel relaxed, calm and peaceful. 
The old buildings are beautifully and sympathetically decorated with so much attention to detail. 
The swimming pool has some sun and shaded areas and beautifully clean.
My husband had a massage, which he enjoyed.
Our room was the suite. Now I have to say, I travel around 9 months of the year and this is one of the best and biggest I have stayed in. We compared it as just short of Raffles in Singapore. Every little detail was thought about. Plenty of room for your toiletries, a plug next to a mirror for the hairdryer, socket next to the bed, etc.
The evening dinner was very romantic, a beautiful setting in an open dining area by the pool. The food was delicious too.
We were lucky enough to have the whole place to ourselves as it was low season. It felt like it was your own beautiful home.
Sadly we only had time for one night. When we next visit Sri Lanka we will be checking in for a week.","Outstanding","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r970785527-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This experience was very different from staying at regular star hotels. Sergeant House is an old mansion that has been renovated to include modern facilities while preserving its original look and feel.

The rooms were very spacious. The one I booked had three bedrooms, and the master bedroom featured an outdoor bathroom. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, ensuring that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

One of the highlights of our stay was the food—it's amazing, and hats off to the chef! I ordered lunch off the menu because I wanted to try authentic Sri Lankan food, and the chef arranged it for us. The taste was so satisfying that I ordered it again for the next day’s lunch.

If you want to have a massage, you don’t need to go out as it's available on the property in a very relaxing environment. I did enjoy it and highly recommend giving it a try.

Additionally, Sergeant House has a private beach, which, although not beachfront, is easily accessible by crossing the road. We spent a good three hours there, although we didn't swim as the sea was rough. The 24-hour pool was another great feature—we had a night swim, and it was a fantastic experience.

Overall, Sergeant House is beautiful and provides a unique and wonderful stay. I will surely be back when I return to Sri Lanka.

Thank you so much for this wonderful review! It truly makes our day to hear you enjoyed the peaceful sanctuary we have strived to create. Yes I fully agree our peacocks do like to make their presence known/felt and they can be rather vocal too. 

Thank you for appreciating and highlighting our gardening and housekeeping teams. They work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the machine is well oiled and I will definitely pas your kind sentiments to them all. They will be thrilled that they were mentioned. 

We recently introduced our new 'Curated Menu Experience', an innovative dining program designed exclusively for our Half Board and Full Board guests. This personalised culinary initiative allows guests to collaborate with our Executive Chef Ruwan and craft a dinner menu of their choice. Through this bespoke service, guests have the opportunity to share their personal preferences with us and our expert chefs carefully curate a customized menu tailored to their tastes and also incorporating dietary constrains. Our commitment to culinary excellence ensures that every dish is prepared with the finest ingredients and presented with exceptional attention to detail. I do hope you had to opportunity to avail of this concept during your stay.

It was our pleasure to have you stay with us and we hope to welcome you back to our little bird-filled paradise sometime soon!

It is fantastic to hear that you found the service excellent and the food delicious. Our culinary team works hard to create memorable dining experiences, especially with our newly introduced Curated Menu Experiences' and I will definitely convey your kind sentiments to them all. 

We designed our accommodations to provide both comfort and a sense of local style and we thank you for appreciating our efforts. 
Our location near Sigiriya rock, the national parks, and the cultural triangle is indeed one of our greatest assets, and I am glad you were able to take advantage of it during your stay.

Thank you again for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to share your experience. We hope to welcome you back to our water garden sanctuary in the future. 

With sunny regards from Sigiriya

The whole vibe of the hotel is very zen, with expanses of rectangular lily-covered ponds, skirted by paths providing good walks and runs, with the added bonus of peacocks displaying their feathers along the way! The hotel provided an excellent place from which to visit Lion Rock, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla. Our only regret is that we stayed only 2 nights, as we would have loved to stay longer. We were pleased we booked a pool suite, which gave us a good way to cool off without going to the main swimming pool (which looks fantastic, by the way). The food was excellent and incredibly good value for a 5-star hotel in a location where they could get away with charging much more. Even the drinks were reasonable ($5 for a 600 ml Lion beer and $10 for a large wine or cocktail). The best aspect was the staff and their attention to service throughout the resort. They all looked so happy and made us also feel so.","Beautiful surroundings, 5-star service and food right in the Cultural Triangle","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r1000549467-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you so much for your detailed and thoughtful review! We are absolutely thrilled that you enjoyed your stay with us and we are  particularly touched by your wonderful description of our grounds - yes, our peacocks do love putting on a show!

Regarding our dining options, you raise an interesting point about our menus. While opinions certainly vary (some guests rave about our international offerings!), many of our regular visitors share your enthusiasm for our Sri Lankan dishes. We will definitely take your feedback about streamlining our a la carte menu into consideration.

What really warmed our hearts was reading about your experience with the alms ceremony. Tharindu, our Naturalist works very hard to arrange these special moments and it is indeed wonderful to know they made such a meaningful impact on your stay.

An impressive hotel, layed out as a series of bungalows surrounding pools filled with lilies, birds and fish. Peacocks welcome you with their flashing feathers and cries. The architecture is modern with a nod to tradition, and the rooms are large and exceptionally well furnished with comfortable beds, seating and spacious bathrooms. I didn't enjoy the public buildings (bar, restaurant) as much in terms of interior design, they seemed a bit generic. Service was always attentive--restaurant and bar staff remembered our preferences and were always welcoming. Spa was well equipped and excellent massages. The main pool feels a bit stark and exposed, but the bungalow plunge pools are a great alternative. Cuisine was stellar if you choose from the Sri Lankan dishes...the more European menu seemed too large and unfocused and the results were not at the same high level IMO. The highlight of our stay was an alms ceremony arranged by the in-house naturalist at a local village temple. A very beautiful experience that I know is challenging to put together and I really appreciated the extra effort.

Everything from the moment our group arrived to the moment we left was excellent and I look forward to bringing more friends to experience this hotel soon. 

The staff of the hotel deserve a special shoutout. They were so accommodating and did everything possible to make our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible and even arranged outside activities for us, including an elephant safari. The staff would go out of their way to make sure any special requests we had were fulfilled, and even gave us their WhatsApp contact info should we need to contact them for anything. The staff also helped my sister and her friend look for some of the crocodiles that populate the water gardens of the hotel, when one was spotted, they would contact her and show up at her villa in one of the hotel buggies ready to rush to the last known croc sighting location. 

The food at the hotel was delicious, the locals and foreign tourists our group comprised of loved everything that the kitchen made for us. The Sri Lankan food deserves particular praise and I'd highly recommend that all guests try their local Sri Lankan food options. The kitchen was also happy to make adjustments to their meals, one of which was having the kitchen make their Kottu using crab instead of the chicken they normally use. The kitchen was happy to oblige, and I have to say it was amazing! I highly recommend any guest put in a special request for a crab kottu, you won't be disappointed.

The hotel has a few types of villas, our group got a duplex villa which could comfortably house 4 people in two separate bedrooms each with their own large bathroom. We also booked two Superior Deluxe villas which can comfortably house 2 to 3 people in one bedroom. Both of the villa types we had contained a private plunge pool, which is a great place to stargaze from on the clear nights. The villas are spacious, clean, and well appointed with modern amenities including universal plug points. The staff would also come by and ask if there was anything we needed, and would also leave homemade local treats like milk toffee or coconut toffee in the room after cleaning, which was a nice touch. 

I'd highly recommend getting a treatment from the spa, the masseuses are well trained and know how to release those tensed-up/knotted muscles. Be sure to book the day before as the spa can get booked up quickly. 

The hotel is on a very large property, so I'd recommend getting a bicycle from the lobby and using that to get around unless you're more fond of walking. There are also plenty of animals that also live in the property, including peacocks, monkeys, tortoises, and monitor lizards, which add to the ambiance of the hotel and create a unique experience when randomly encountering one of the animals when walking around the hotel grounds. 

Our group stayed for two nights, but by the end we wished we could have stayed longer.

WOW - thank you so much for this absolutely wonderful review! We are completely thrilled that you had such an amazing experience with us. Your enthusiasm is infectious, and we are indeed delighted that we were able to exceed your expectations in every way!

We are particularly glad you enjoyed our spacious villas and comfortable beds. Our Executive Chef Ruwan is delighted to hear that you enjoyed the cuisine on offer and his flexibility with your preferences. He loves being able to tailor dishes to our guests' tastes!

But what really made us smile was reading about your wildlife encounters during breakfast walks! That is not something one can do often however it is a reality at Water Garden Sigiriya. As you have correctly pointed out 3 nights definitely isn't long enough to experience everything we have to offer! We would absolutely love to welcome you back for a longer stay next time. 

Just let us know when you are thinking of returning, and we will make sure to reserve one of our best villas to welcome you back. 

Once again, thank you for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to share such wonderful feedback and enjoy the rest of your time in Sri Lanka.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback about your recent stay with us. We are firstly delighted that you found our accommodation to exceed your expectations and that the cleanliness, spaciousness, and particularly the spectacular view of the rock from your pool were highlights of your stay. 

Regarding your dining experience, we appreciate your feedback and would like to clarify a few points about our half-board package options. While you opted for the five-course dinner menu, please note that our half-board guests actually have three dining options available:

The set menu of the day with options.
Selection of a main course from our traditional Sri Lankan menu.
Selection of a main courses from the a la carte menu if the former 2 menus are not to your personal liking. 

We understand that views on food and preferences naturally vary from person to person and across different cultures and that dining experiences are highly subjective, yet we respect the opinions of all our guests. 

Additionally, while bottled water does incur a charge in most hotels, we do offer complimentary filtered jug water throughout your meal service. My apologies if this information was not clearly communicated during your stay, and we will make sure to better inform our guests about these options moving forward.

Your observations about the indoor dining area and service style are noted. On the days in question during your stay period, we had 2 large groups resident in the hotel who had requested one long table to be placed on the terrace area of the restaurant. Naturally moving most of tables from the air-conditioned indoor area to the outer terrace would have created an ambiance of emptiness which I can assure is not the norm on other days. We will however see how best we can balance both the indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.  We also appreciate your comparison with other Sri Lankan hotels, presumably done with hotels in the same league as ours, as this helps us benchmark our services. 

Thank you again for your candid feedback. We hope to welcome you back in the future, where we will strive to match the excellence of your accommodation experience across all aspects of your stay.

The accommodation itself is excellent - very clean, spacious, comfortable and we had an amazing view of the rock from our pool - thank you.
We were on a half-board package and found the food both rather ordinary and a bit pretentious.  The bread was not always fresh and the 5 🤷‍♀️ course dinner menu had limited options. Fresh water was not included with dinner - it was charged extra. The inside seating, when there wasn’t space on the veranda, was soulless.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our spacious villas, comfortable mattresses, and warm pool facilities. 

My apologies with regard to the housekeeping issues you have mentioned. We have reviewed our housekeeping cleaning logs and they indicate that our housekeeping team did attempt to service your villa but due to the Do Not Disturb mode being active, we respected your privacy preference and did not enter the room. The next day when the team arrived at your villas for the service it was declined one member of your party.  Unfortunately as the soiled linen was laced inside the closet with the rest of your personal belongings,  our protocol requires us to wait for explicit permission to collect them, which unfortunately did not happen during your stay. As some of the bottles of water were half full and not empty they were not removed. While this explains the situation, it does not excuse the suboptimal cleanliness you experienced and I apologise for the mishap. 

Thank you for having booked and stayed with us and I look forward to welcoming you all back.
Enjoy the rest of your time in Sri Lanka.

The quality of the restaurant was perfect. Plenty of Sri Lanka and international dishes with space to eat inside or outside. 

We only stayed 2 nights here on a tour but could easily imagine escaping here for a longer winter break. The hotel can organise plenty of activities locally, there's space to walk/cycle and a great gym/spa. 

I highly recommend starting the day with a yoga session with Rikki in the yoga pavilion, which looks out on water and has monkeys and peacocks milling around. Rikki’s a brilliant teacher and the yoga was different to yoga I’ve done at home. There’s more emphasis on breathing (something I’m a bit lazy about) and I felt like I was using my core differently. 

When you’ve got a busy itinerary there’s a lot of pressure to eat breakfast and be in the car by 9am, but starting the day with yoga/meditation was one of the highlights of my trip to Sri Lanka.   

I was so spaced out after one session I forgot how to unlock my phone (which is no small feat, since my face unlocks it)! Another day a monkey came to watch. I’d go back to Water Garden just for the yoga.

Our team takes great pride in creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere for our guests, and I will personally commend them for their outstanding contributions to your stay.

Your kind words about our location overlooking Sigiriya rock, the peaceful grounds, spacious accommodations, and the quality of our dining offerings are much appreciated. I will also convey your kind sentiments to our Executive Chef and his team. Yes the natural symphony of peacocks is indeed one of the unique features that makes Water Garden Sigiriya special. There are many eco systems within our property which attract many species of birds and mammals. Tharindu, our Naturalist cum Game Ranger is always around to provide a guided tour of the gardens. 

We are honoured that you would recommend our hotel to others and are thrilled to hear of your intention to return.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Sri Lanka.

With sunny regards from Sigiriya

We were given a tour of the grounds and villa by our lovely Butler Dinuka who was superb throughout our stay.  The accommodation was specious, well designed and very clean.  Our breakfasts and dinners throughout were excellent and always served with a smile by our lovely waiter Salindu.  The grounds are spacious and extremely peaceful, in fact the only noise you hear are from the peacocks.

We did arrive during the offseason where there are less guests. 
They welcomed us with a traditional drummer and another traditional ceremony, lighting of the lamp. 
The hotel is situated by the lagoon in Bentota, on the beach. The hotel is is very classy and site on the property well, and the landscaping to match. I was told that the design was done by J. Bawa, and it is simple and beautiful. 
The rooms are very clean, good size, well maintained and most of them provide a view of the ocean. There is also a balcony for each room and the views are very calming. 
There are 2 pools and they are well kept by the pool staff. 
All the staff here are very helpful and I would rate them as excellent. 
The food was very good but, there is a lot of room for improvement. The breakfast buffet was excellent and had very good choices, including freshly made hoppers and roti. The dinner buffet could use some improvement as it could use more Sri Lankan dishes. The grill area was pretty good and it is a great idea. 

Overall, we loved the stay here and would definitely stay here again.","Beautiful photos","2025-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r1016198694-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The service was excellent. The team was warm, responsive, and very accommodating. We were especially grateful that they upgraded our room upon request, which made our stay even more enjoyable. The upgraded room was spacious, comfortable, and offered beautiful views it made us feel pampered and valued as guests.

One of the biggest highlights was the Indian food we got at the restaurant it was absolutely delicious! The quality, taste, and presentation were on point, and it truly felt like a slice of home away from home.

Mr. Ananda, Mr. Vignesh, Mr. Chamodi, Mrs. Shehan, Mr. Migara, Ms. Vijitha, and especially Chef Mohammad, who was incredibly kind and talented. Each of them brought a personal touch to their service l smiling, attentive, and ready to help. Chef Mohammad made sure our meals were perfect and catered to our preferences with care and warmth.

We were personally greeted by the owner Michel and his Manager on arrival and check-in procedures were conducted pool side overlooking the lake whilst sipping our welcome drink.

The rooms are large, spotlessly clean and well equipped with everything you could possibly want or need.

This hotel is all about service. Everything is anticipated by the staff. Drinks and snacks appear as soon as you settle by the pool, rooms are tidied and clean the minute you step out the door, the waiter appears to take your order as soon as you look up and a staff member appears like magic with a torch to light your way back to your room after your meal.

Please, please do eat at the restaurant as it is like having your own personal chef. We ate at some great restaurants in The Galle Face in Colombo, The Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya and the Marriot Hotel at Weligama Beach but for us the three meals we had at the Lake Lodge were the best we had in our 18 days in Sri Lanka.

A lovely comfortable room, with a nice outlook and good facilities. What really set this place apart was the quality of the food, both in taste and presentation. They have an excellent chef, who came out afterwards to chat with guests, as did the owner. 

All the other staff were excellent too; friendly, efficient and professional. Holding the restaurant open a bit later than usual to accommodate our late arrival from watching the Slender Loris was really welcome! 

Small touches like the glasses of juice and some fruit brought to the room each evening before dinner, and the chocolates on the bed, really added to the overall experience.

Thank you so much for your heartfelt and detailed review! We’re overjoyed to hear that your time at Lake Lodge was such a memorable and relaxing experience. It’s wonderful that you appreciated the peaceful setting, the beautifully kept grounds, and the little touches like the quirky ornaments and blooming orchids that bring a smile.

It’s fantastic to know the Sri Lankan curry and overall dining experience exceeded your expectations, and your kind words for Michel, Pulasthi, Dilshan, and the entire team truly mean the world to us.

We’re so glad we could arrange memorable excursions for you, like the walking safari to see lorises and the jeep safari at Minneriya—what an incredible way to explore the local wildlife. Your thoughtful note about leaving as friends sums up exactly the kind of experience we hope to offer every guest.

Fortunately for us - but a shame for the hotel and team - we were the only guests here for the duration of our stay, meaning we had the whole place to ourselves. The Lake Lodge only has 10 rooms anyway, but we had the huge beautiful pool, excellent restaurant, and all the team who work here just for us!  
Not only is the property very well laid out and kept pristine, but the quirky little ornaments throughout the place and amazing orchids just bring a smile when you see a new one. 
Our room was on the top floor and looked over part of the gardens and on to a small rainforest area. Very peaceful, with lots of little birds of all shapes, sizes and colours always darting around. 
We watched sunset the first night around 6pm, just as the flying foxes begin to come out to fly away and feed, when there was a knock on the door and two complimentary cocktails arrived with a small bowl of snacks for us to enjoy the sunset even more. One of the many gestures Lake Lodge do to make your stay as fabulous as they can. 
At dinner the first night we met Michel the owner, who was welcoming and friendly.  We had a choice of two starters and three main courses and selected the Sri Lankan Curry as our main course. Amazing … and HUGE portions. Along with your selected curry there are three other vegetable curries and rice. The flours were excellent as was the presentation and service. It was like that all the time we were here. 
In summary, from checking in through to checking out, this has been one of the best experiences of a hotel we have had on our travels over many years. The pool is amazing .. you don’t get Italian Porcelain Patio slabs .. but you are in Sri Lanka!  You get lovely authentic local materials which are kept to the highest degree. 
Pulasthi and his team (a special mention to Dilshan) make you feel so special.  Nothing is too much and you leave the place feeling you’ve left friends behind. Pulasthi also arranged a local walking safari to see Loris’s and a jeep Safari to see the elephants at Minneriya for us - all at prices far less than we had seen online. 
This truly is a REAL boutique hotel experience that you simply must try if you came to the Dambulla/Kandalama area. 
Thank you all at the Lake Lodge.","Lake Lodge Luxury","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d1822843-r969234512-Lake_Lodge_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

We loved our accommodation on the beach-Palam 5. -Beautiful comfortable bed, outdoor garden shower and indoor bath and views to die for of the ocean. Watching the local fisherman every day bringing in their haul was fantastic.

Schon bei der Ankunft fühlt man sich wie in einer anderen Welt. Der Empfang durch den persönlichen Butler ist nicht nur eine nette Geste, sondern setzt den perfekten Ton für den gesamten Aufenthalt. Man wird hier nicht einfach nur empfangen, man wird verwöhnt!

Die Wohnzelte – ja, richtig gehört – sind alles andere als gewöhnlich. Sie strahlen Eleganz und Stil aus und sind mit einem Auge fürs Detail eingerichtet. Jedes Element scheint dafür gedacht zu sein, eine Atmosphäre von Luxus und Komfort zu schaffen. Es ist ein Gefühl, als würdest du in ein absolut hochwertiges Boutique-Hotel einchecken, nur eben mitten in der Natur. Wer hätte gedacht, dass Camping auf so hohem Niveau möglich ist? Hier wird Clamping tatsächlich zum Erlebnis.

Die gesamte Anlage ist strahlend schön. Der Pool ist so stilvoll gestaltet, dass man fast vergisst, dass man sich im Freien befindet. Mit bequemen Liegen und schattenspendenden Palmen kannst du dich einfach zurücklehnen und die Seele baumeln lassen. Die Lounge-Bereiche sind ästhetisch und durchdacht eingerichtet – perfekt für entspanntes Zusammensitzen mit Freunden oder für romantische Abende zu zweit. Und wenn du Lust auf einen Sundowner hast, gibt es nichts Besseres, als den Sonnenuntergang über dem Meer zu genießen.

Der private Strandbereich ist ein weiteres Highlight. Hier kommt man in den Genuss eines großen, weißen Sandstrandes, der perfekt zum Entspannen einlädt. Der Zugang zum Meer ist einfach traumhaft. Das glasklare Wasser lädt dazu ein, einen Sprung hinein zu wagen. Vergiss die überfüllten Strände anderer Resorts – hier hast du das Gefühl, dass dieser Strand nur für dich reserviert ist. Es ist der ideale Ort, um die Ruhe der Natur zu genießen oder einfach nur die Füße im Sand zu vergraben.

Was das kulinarische Angebot betrifft, wird man hier mehr als nur verwöhnt. Ob Frühstück oder Abendessen – die Küche des Hauses lässt keine Wünsche offen. Das Essen ist auf einem absoluten Top-Niveau, das selbst die anspruchsvollsten Gaumen begeistert. Die Auswahl an Gerichten ist einfach überwältigend, und jedes Gericht ist nicht nur eine Gaumenfreude, sondern auch ein Fest für die Augen. Man merkt sofort, dass hier aus hochwertigen Zutaten mit viel Liebe zum Detail gekocht wird.

Das Personal ist ein weiterer Grund, warum dieses Hotel so besonders ist. Hier trifft Professionalität auf eine lockere, freundliche Art, die sofort einlädt, sich wohlzufühlen. Jeder Mitarbeiter scheint perfekt auf die Location eingestimmt zu sein. Man merkt, dass sie ihre Arbeit mit Leidenschaft machen und stets bemüht sind, den Gästen jeden Wunsch von den Lippen abzulesen. Diese Kombination aus Effizienz und Herzlichkeit gibt dir das Gefühl, wirklich geschätzt und gut aufgehoben zu sein.

Es ist schwer, die vielen positiven Aspekte dieses Hotels in Worte zu fassen. Es sind eben die Kleinikeiten! Aber eines ist klar: Dieses Resort ist für all jene gemacht, die das Schöne und Feine lieben und in ihrem Leben Wert auf Qualität und das schöne und feine legen. Hier werden die Erwartungen nicht nur erfüllt, sondern weit übertroffen. 

In einer Zeit, in der viele Hotels versuchen, durch Massenbetrieb zu glänzen, ist dieses Resort ein Lichtblick. Es ist ein Ort, an dem du dich wirklich erholen kannst, wo du die Natur in vollen Zügen genießen kannst und wo jeder Moment zählt. Wirklich außergewöhnlich! Wenn du also auf der Suche nach einem unvergesslichen Erlebnis bist, ist dies der perfekte Ort. Ich kann es kaum erwarten, wiederzukommen und mich erneut von diesem wunderbaren Hotel und seinen fantastischen Mitarbeitern verwöhnen zu lassen.
 

Fazit: Das Karpaha und seine Mitarbeiter, ist sicherlich auch auf diesem sehr hohen Niveau, weil Umberto mit seiner unerschöpflichen Erfahrung am Steuer sitzt! Wenn du das nächste Mal auf der Suche nach einer Unterkunft bist, die all deine Erwartungen übertrifft, dann ist dieses Hotel genau das richtige. Hier fühlst du dich nicht nur wie ein Gast, sondern wie ein Teil von etwas Großartigem. Also pack deine Koffer und mach dich bereit für ein Erlebnis, das du niemals vergessen wirst!","Ein Juwel für das schöne und gute auf Sri Lanka","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r1013881576-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

Visit the spa.  Eat the food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We are sitting by the pool on our last full day here and wanted to take a few mins out of our day to write a review of this lovely hotel.  

This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  It’s not just one thing but the entire experience that has just ticked every box.  

I have to talk about Nifras first - our butler.   He worked tirelessly to make our trip perfect.  Having a WhatsApp link is a great idea and he responded to what ever we needed. He was on site from early til late and responded quickly when we needed anything.   He brought us coffee in morning, arranged our trips, answers questions and even sorted my spa bookings for me.   It’s a great idea.  More hotels should give you one contact point.   All the staff are great but Nifras made our holiday.  

The manager Umberto is very present.  He greets all guests at reception and is very friendly and open to discuss anything.  I get the impression he has transformed this hotel from good to great.  He is open to discuss anything that you think may improve the hotel.   He’s a character too and great to speak to.  

Rooms.  When they say it’s a tent - you don’t get a true idea of how
Lovely this is.  We stayed in a Palam suite on the beach.  It was great.  Amazing views when we opened the curtains every morning.  We had our own private loungers on the beach.  Outside showers are lush.  Aircon is loud but very affective.   We would message Nifras when we went to breakfast and he would sort our housekeeping visit for us.  Housekeeping were very efficient and effective and I loved the daily delivery of cookies or cakes.  

Spa was exceptional.  I booked for the Head over heels - 5 treatments over 5 days.  Loved my treatments and really made me feel relaxed and calm.  Therapists were very skilled.  

Food is another high point.   Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all very tasty.  We had a beach bbq one night too.  Lovely.  Our only complaint is that the portions are huge so we did feel
Over faced at times.  But we did learn to share dishes to avoid this.   The prawn cakes are great and I loved the chicken and cashew fried rice on lunch menu and the similar dish at dinner.  Husband loved the mutton curry.   Breakfasts were so good we didn’t need lunch most days.  

Mention of the dogs.  The dogs that are associated with the hotel are all well fed and looked after.   Nice to see.  We had one pup who adopted us and loved to sleep under our Loungers by the pool.  

One suggestion - would benefit from a little shop near reception for snacks, refreshments and local souvenirs like the lovely toiletries in the rooms.  Another way to support the local community.  

We would come back here in a flash.  A truely special place.","A top class and beautiful hotel.","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r1013865065-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

Der Empfang durch den GM war sehr freundlich und unser persönlicher Butler, Malshan, führte uns zu unserer Gartenvilla. Uns wurde alles ausführlich und detailreich erklärt und gezeigt. Die Gartenvilla (Zelt Villa)  liegt in einem privaten Garten und ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, sowie auch sehr sauber. Kleinigkeiten, die wir benötigten, wurden umgehend von Malshan besorgt. Die Bereitstellung eines persönlichen Mobilgeräts für Wi-Fi und die Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Service ist eine ausgezeichnete Idee.

Die gesamte Hotelanlage ist super stilvoll angelegt und eingerichtet. An jeder Ecke finden sich liebevoll gestaltete, hochwertige Details und gemütliche Orte zum verweilen. 

Einige Anmerkungen zur Gartenvilla: Auf den Bildern der Hotelwebsite wirkt sie deutlich heller als in der Realität. Die Seitenabdeckungen werden aufgrund des warmen Wetters meist geschlossen gehalten, damit die Klimaanlage effektiv arbeiten kann. Dies führt zu einer geringeren Helligkeit in der Villa. Die verbauten Insektenschutznetze, die bei geöffneter Abdeckung zum Vorschein kommen, sind zudem recht löchrig, was die Nutzung in den kühleren Abendstunden einschränkt. Daher ist es in der Villa leider immer etwas dunkel und elektrisches Licht notwendig, was den Charme des Ganzen etwas mindert. Die Außendusche ist zwar wunderschön mit einem tollen natürlichen Garten, jedoch ist sie an den Seiten etwas offen, sodass sie von bestimmten Blickwinkeln vom Weg oder im Garten einsehbar ist. Dies könnte optimiert werden. Wer absolute Privatsphäre erwartet, sollte dies berücksichtigen. 

Die Speisenauswahl im Restaurant ist wirklich ausgezeichnet und bietet eine große Vielfalt. Auch für vegetarische und vegane Gäste wird ein umfangreiches Angebot bereitgestellt. Auch die Dessertauswahl ist hervorragend und die Getränkekarte sehr gut sortiert. Hier bleiben keine Wünsche offen. 

Ob Meeresfrüchte, Fleischgerichte oder vegetarische Optionen – jedes Gericht hat uns ausgezeichnet gut geschmeckt und wurde mit viel Sorgfalt und handwerklichem Geschick zubereitet.

Das gesamte Personal der Anlage war uns gegenüber stets überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit – vielen Dank an alle! 

Der Infinity-Pool in der Nähe des Restaurants ist der schönste Hotelpool, den wir je erlebt haben. Normalerweise nutzen wir bei einem direkten Meerzugang nie den Pool oder den Poolbereich. Hier haben wir jedoch wunderschöne Nachmittage verbracht, das angenehme Wasser und den Service der Kellner genossen, die uns mit köstlichen Cocktails (fantastisch gemixt vom Barmann Nadji) und Snacks versorgt haben :)  Der Ausblick auf den Strand und das Treiben der lokalen Fischer ist einzigartig.

Bezüglich der Fischer und des Strandes: Auf beiden Seiten des Hotelstrandes haben die Fischer ihre lokalen Basen. Man kann sie täglich beim Herausfahren, Wiederanlegen und Einholen ihres Fangs beobachten. Das Hotel bewirbt diese Situation als romantische Erfahrung. Diese Empfindung teilen wir jedoch nicht gänzlich. Die Netze werden mehrfach täglich mit Hilfe von lauten Traktoren eingeholt, und Fischereimüll ist über den gesamten Strand verteilt, auch wenn direkt vor dem Hotel versucht wird den Strand sauber zu halten. Teilweise werden die gefangenen kleinen Fische direkt am Strand mit Salz bestreut und getrocknet, was für entsprechenden Geruch sorgt. Kaputte Netze, Plastik und allerhand Müll sind hier am Strand leider allgegenwärtig. Wir finden die enge Verwurzelung der lokalen Community mit dem Hotel und die gute Nachbarschaft wirklich toll. Im Sinne der Nachhaltigkeit wäre es aber wünschenswert, dass das Hotel mit den Fischern an diesen Themen arbeitet, wobei wir natürlich für die lokalen Gegebenheiten Verständnis haben. Die Menschen bestreiten hier ihren Lebensunterhalt, und die Arbeit sieht sehr hart aus. 

Die streunenden Hunde, die in Sri Lanka weit verbreitet sind, werden seitens des Hotels offenbar gut betreut. Sie wirken deutlich gesünder als anderswo auf der Insel und sind sehr freundlich. Es ist schön zu sehen, dass man hier ein Herz für diese Tiere hat. 

Abschließend möchten wir uns nochmals herzlich beim gesamten Personal bedanken, insbesondere vor allem bei Malshan. Er hat sich während unseres Aufenthalts sehr zuvorkommend um uns gekümmert und war stets für uns erreichbar. Sein Einsatz war der maßgebliche Faktor für unsere angenehme Erfahrung hier. 

Insgesamt können wir dem Resort jedoch lediglich vier von fünf Sternen vergeben, insbesondere im Vergleich zu ähnlichen Hotels der gleichen Preisklasse.","Karpaha Sands","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r1010154852-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

Das Karpaha Sands Resort hat alle unsere Erwartungen übertroffen. 

Die geräumige und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtete Unterkunft mit Blick auf das Meer war ein Traum - die gesamte Anlage ebenfalls. Der Strand ist sehr breit und mehrere Kilometer lang. Rechts und links gibt es keine weiteren Hotels. Wer Ruhe und Erholung sucht, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. 

Für uns gab es noch 2 weitere Highlights: 
Das Essen - egal ob Frühstück oder Abendessen - war ein kulinarischer Genuss! Es gab zu jeder Tageszeit eine sehr große Auswahl an einheimischen/sri-lankischen Gerichten - aber auch Fusion und italienische Gerichte wurden angeboten - alles auf sehr hohem Niveau mit hochwertigen und frischen Zutaten. 

Ein weiteres Highlight: Der Service! Umberto ist ein sehr charmanter Gastgeber, der jeden Tag seine Gäste herzlich begrüßt und sich auch Zeit für ein Gespräch nimmt. 

Besonders hervorheben möchten wir die Aufmerksamkeit, den hervorragenden Service und die Freundlichkeit, die uns Malshan entgegengebracht hat. Wir haben uns sehr ""verwöhnt"" gefühlt - vielen Dank Malshan! 

Das gesamte Personal war unglaublich freundlich, offen und service-orientiert. Jeden Morgen bekamen wir einen extra Schuss Mango-Smoothie mit einem strahlenden Lächeln, nur weil man bemerkt hatte, wie lecker wir ihn fanden. Vielen Dank an das gesamte Team für den traumhaften und sehr erholsamen Urlaub.

I experienced excellent hospitality by all staff who went over and above to make my stay pleasant and comfortable. The staff at the front desk were friendly, flexible and attentive at all times. The hotel boasts an excellent in-house restaurant under the direction of Rasika, Executive Chef, offering a wide range of foods inspired by cuisines around the world presented with the assistance of many expert hands including pastry chef Nipun Nethsara and Anuhas. I would like to thank other catering staff including Champaka, Priyantha and Gihan who provided a swift and excellent service.
The rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean thanks to House-keeping staff, Yasaratne Basnayake and Ravindu, making my stay a comfortable and pleasant one.  The Mirage houses a roof top restaurant with a breathtaking view of the sea and the beach and surrounding areas, and also pool and gym facilities.

We had a Gallery suite which was fabulous - spacious, stunning view of the pool and river, jacuzzi on the balcony, free minibar and attentive butler service via a mobile phone given to you at check in.
Nothing was too much trouble at all and our only regret was using the hotel more as a base than somewhere to chill. The decor imparts a real feeling of relaxation throughout the hotel and you never really trip up on other people as you wander round.

From the moment you arrive, you are treated to luxurious surroundings and attentive service, exemplified by a personal butler who provides what looks suspiciously like a 'burner phone' so that you can call them at any time. 

The room was spacious and well appointed with a balcony overlooking the river with a daybed on it. This was especially nice after dinner listening to the river and birds. 

The food was excellent and breakfast plentiful and delicious, with a good choice of Sri Lankan, European and vegetarian options. It felt nice to dress up and enjoy the fine dining experience. All of the team were delightful (including the trainees, one of whom nervously opened a bottle of sparkling wine, later admitting that he had never before opened one in front of a customer!).

At the top, we were warmly greeted by the owner, Michel, and his staff who soon whisked the luggage away to our large room with balcony. There were definitely a few French influences in the room.
With a limited number of guests in only 10 rooms, there is a sense of peace around the 20m swimming pool. The hotel is just a few kilometres from Sigiriya and the Dambulla Cave Temples so you should be able to fit in some leisure time in the heat of the day after a couple of early morning starts. The massages are great value.
For a small donation to the local children’s orphanage, guests can enjoy a foot massage in a tank of small, nibbling fish. It is quite an odd sensation, but not unpleasant.
Breakfast and dinner are served at tables set out along one side of the pool. In a land where it is possible to eat some delightful meals, each course really stood out.
Michel is a lot of fun, and always seems close by for a chat, although he’s never intrusive.

Well imagine being able to trust in an entire team of kind, knowledgeable, loving, and thoughtful individuals. That is the team at The Surfer, Sri Lanka. My gratitude for each member of The Surfer runs deep. I can honestly say my life will forever be changed for the better after my experience here. 

I have so much love for all of them, so brace yourself as this is about to be a long winded review. 

When you first arrive at the surfer, you are greeted by one of two warm security guards. They do their job but it doesn’t feel like ‘security’ is needed as everyone is respectful of one another around here. Then you’ll climb 3 flights of stairs. Along the way you feel welcomed by the always smiling house keeping and maintenance team. These guys are always hard working and know everything to make it possible for the surf camp to run smoothly. There’s a whole team of these guys that are doing things behind the screen to make each day easy for the guests of the surfer. 

Once you reach the stunning and tranquil upstairs floor, you’ll be greeted by an array of wonderful people and the sweetest dog darling. At check-in you meet the surfer hype girl Elise. By day she is front of house and by night she brings the party. You’ll also meet Damith at check-in, whose gentleness makes you immediately comfortable. And if you’re really really lucky, on arrival you get checked in by Hansa. Hansa is wise and his soul is so beautiful it lights up the sky. 

Before I go deeper into the team, I must call attention to the amazing food at the Surfer. The kitchen team works magic from their breakfasts to the special dinners. So yummy, so delicious. You can trust the food here and you will enjoy every bite. 

Now the volunteers… 
Melanie, the on staff yoga instructor. So nice and caring. 
Maya, an unforgettable Aussie. Her smile lights up the room and she makes being a beginner surfer so fun. Lean into her cheeky nature and you’ll have a great time, even when you’re swallowing salt water as a baby surfer. 
Romney, another unforgettable Aussie. Her kindness and delicious coffees will make you never want to leave the tranquilly of the upstairs. 
Emily and Matty- if you want to know the technical aspects of surfing, listen to these two. Matty and Emily both teach important surf theory, and they make learning and applying it so much fun. 

The founder of the surfer is a strong stoic man named Larihu. How Larihu pulls off all the coordination and logistics of camp is pure magic. If you want an honest suggestion, recommendation or opinion go to Larihu. He’s always kind and truthful but professional at the same time. Larihu is a true leader, through and through. 

I’m specifically leaving my feedback about the team of Sri Lankan surf instructors for last because I love these guys so much it makes me emotional. 

Nadiv, my little brother. From rooftop pop-up practice, to cuddles on the couch. Nadiv’s heart is so pure. He so much fun to surf with and he’s a bit silly so if you’re like me, he helps you remember to have fun. 
Bunny, he’s the fun fun. Another great surfer that relieves some of the stressors of surfing with his big smile and contagious giggle. 
Kusa and Reshan, when you’re in the water with these two guys you feel safe. They’re such strong surfers you know you are in good hands. 

Lastly, and certainly not least, Sohan. Here he is call Supiri Sohan, which means super or supreme. This is an understatement. True, Sohan has magical supreme powers. But his power as a surfer, and a surf instructor is only half the story. His knowledge about people, how they think and how they learn is so strong. He’s so smart, a bit shy and his heart is massive. 

In closing, if you want to learn about surfing, how to surf, and discover more about yourself, go to The Surfer. Trust in the process, listen to the guidance of your instructors and you’ll become a surfer.","Trust in The Surfer","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d8847015-r983362667-The_Surfer_Surf_Camp_Sri_Lanka-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

One of the highlights of our stay was the safari organized by the hotel. We were incredibly lucky to spot a majestic tusker, a few elusive leopards, and even a sloth bear on the same trip! Seeing all three of these rare animals in one safari was a truly unforgettable and rare experience.

After a thrilling day in the wild, returning to the calm and cozy ambiance of Tribe Yala was the perfect way to unwind. The setting, right inside the forest, gave us a true sense of adventure while still offering all the comforts of a top-notch hotel.

The staff were amazing they literally could not do enough for you, soooo attentive and helpful. Breakfast was served up high on a treetop platform which was amazing and our evenings meals were really tasty considering we were in the middle of nowhere. The cocktails were fab too. Only downside is the journey to the hotel after a safari drive, it was an extra 30 mins so if you are older or have a disability this place might not be for you. Also if you don’t like having geckos, insects, frogs etc in your room then I recommend you stay in a hotel.

This property is run as a kind of “100% WhatsApp shop” as the staff almost exclusively comunicate with this app. Unfortunately - spoiler alert - we have no use for WhatsApp, but nevertheless managed to survive. Be aware, though, that the lobby is usually manned just for arrivals & departures, there is no phone in the room to contact staff and some staff struggle with english. The property is very nice, completely immersed in the jungle. Arrival is tough (half hour ride on gravel & really bumpy road from the agreed meeting point), wild animals do roam around in the night, paths occasionally get flooded during downpours and quite sizable frogs mysteriously somehow found their way into our bathroom (we freed 6 of them during our stay). Weather permitting breakfast is served on a a scenic tree canopy and dinner usually is served in the open in front of a burning log. Food was really good, service was occasionally a bit slow and hesitating (the property seems a bit understaffed) but staff is very kind.

Outdoor shower with both hot and cold water. Clean, comfortable beds with cloud like pillows and mosquito nets. The private rooms are not air tight so little friends can get in and keep you company (frogs and little lizards), but this is part of the experience. You are amongst the animals in their natural habitat! The staff was so kind and helpful. They arranged a private dinner for us nestled in a nook between the trees on a sweetheart table with lanterns that lit the way - so romantic and magical. It rained the morning we left and the rain made the whole morning so relaxing and even more peaceful. Their food was delicious. Best coconut sambol we had the whole trip.

Breakfast in the treetop was definitely a delightful experience listening to the morning bird chorus and seeing the numerous birds flitting over the tree canopy. Would be an ideal place for bird watchers.

We spent two incredibly tranquil nights in the Tussker tent, only seeing other people when we were so kindly and generously served by Bandara and his amazing team. Nothing was too much trouble - post-safari breakfast in our own treehouse, dessert back in our tent when our kids were too tired to stay awake at the end of dinner. Without us asking, Bandara set up an amazing candlelit private dinner for us in the bush. The food is really tasty, especially breakfast. 
The tent itself is huge and well equipped, and feels totally away from any other tents so you can imagine you have the whole place to yourself. 
I also want to give a massive shout out to “T-Rex”, our safari guide. Request him if you can. He is so passionate and knowledgeable about all the wildlife, not just the big leopard chase that everyone seems to go crazy for in Yala (but he also showed us a leopard!). Thanks to his enthusiasm, we saw a baby elephant, a pregnant elephant, mongeese, a golden coyote, black necked stork and Indian pitta (both very rare to spot), a samba deer as well as the usual sightings of spotted deer and crocodiles. Our driver (sorry not to get his name) was really committed to getting us in the best spots without making us feel unsafe or part of the wild frenzy. 
It feels like such a special treat staying here, one we will never forget. Thank you.","Escape the world!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r994940553-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

It is situated on top of a hill with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and tea plantations.
The facade of the building is as it was when built. The interior has had a refurbishment and the accommodation rooms made bigger from the original but still in style with the original.
Staff are attentive with immaculate uniforms and always helpful.
R. Thanushan in the Hethersett Bar went over and above with his service.
Pathmaraj has been with the Heritance for 29 years and gave us a wonderful tour of the gardens under his control.
Absolutely immaculate.
The downside is the hotel is in the middle of nowhere with a very narrow road leading to it. Unless you had access to a tuk-tuk you are stuck there. The accommodation was included in our trip however the food was very expensive for the quality and quantity.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed experience following your recent stay at Araliya Green City, Nuwara Eliya.

We also sincerely appreciate your constructive feedback regarding the room layout and specific challenges with accessing the safety locker. Your comments are invaluable to us, and we will certainly review the room arrangement with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to identify how we can improve the functionality and comfort of the space, especially the placement of the safe.

Once again, thank you for your thoughtful review. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future for an even more enjoyable and seamless stay.

Araliya Green city was a comfortable hotel. 

Room we were occupying was warm and cozy but a bit cluttered with furniture. Bath cum Toilet was comparatively compact in relation to the space in the room. We found it difficult to freely access the safety locker as it was placed opposite a large closet providing only a narrow space between them. It was inconvenient to open the safe due to lack of space in front. It would be good if this receives attention. May be the issue can be easily solved by moving this piece of furniture containing the safe to a more spacious area within the room providing better operating space.  

The concept of having a food court accessible from the hotel helped us to select what we liked from a variety of cuisine. The garden space adjacent to the food court was very colourful and attractive. 

Heated pool in the enclosed upper most floor was an important amenity which we appreciated but we found the lounge area in the ground floor rather cold to relax. Cold draft was regularly blowing in through the entrance every time the door opened and this area did not have heating.","Centrally located city hotel","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d12864938-r1010383889-Araliya_Green_City-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Both stays were too short, the first one was coming from airport and leaving next morning on a bus, second coming in the evening by train and leaving at 4AM for the airport. Next time we hope to stay longer and really savour the experience. I am not sure how much we paid (tour group), but it was worth every penny and much more. Treated like family from the moment you get down from the bus. Excellent spacious rooms. Quick elevators. Enough power outlets. Bathroom was superlative. View of course!! Indian ocean across the road, rail track and beach. The 1st floor restaurant is all glass, looking out on the ocean. Excellent Buffet the first night and next morning. The second night, it was past 9pm and they gave us a Set Menu which was also excellent.  And when they found out we had to leave at 4AM they OFFERED to give us packed breakfasts, choice of veg or non-veg. Made fresh at 4AM, sandwiches, cup of fruit and a bottle of water. Everyone I said that to, said ""Wow! THAT is hospitality!"" Their motto is ""Work Hard and Be Nice to People"" and they really live up to that and more. We felt that we were leaving old friends, when we checked out. Really hope to be back. In some 60 years of wandering the planet, I cannot think of a handful of hotels that were this memorable. What would I want changed? Nitpicking here, but Vattalappam as I remember from the 1960s was less spongy, more coconut milk and jaggery flavor. Maybe time has distorted my memory, but that was one of my Must-Haves, and they had that as option the last night Set Menu. With the Buffet you don't have space on plate or tummy for much of this.","""Work Hard and Be Nice To People"" is their motto and how they live up to it!!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5892306-r992190856-Mirage_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Light sleepers may want to bring ear plugs (peacocks)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wonderful hotel set in highly manicured gardens with ponds and lakes.  Took us ages to get to the hotel from Colombo but what a lovely oasis.  There are peacocks and peahens everywhere (quite noisy at times) plus fresh water crocs , and loads of lovely birds including blue kingfisher - it is so lovely and the birds clearly love it. 

The ‘villa’ (bungalow) we stayed in (no 5) was very spacious and extremely well presented and very clean. Our bungalow had a small plunge pool. The room bar was well stocked and there were lots of little extras - the shampoo was nice which was a bonus, as I had forgotten to pack my own!! Doh! 

The paths leading to the main restaurant and reception are quite well light but there are torches in the room.  We felt quite safe and the fresh water Crocodiles are afraid of people and really aren’t very big. I reckon I could have wrestled them and I’m quite small. 

I slept really well but my wife was disturbed a few times during the night by the calling peacocks outside so bring some earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. 

The paths are made of fine sandy grit so remember to take your shoes off when entering your bungalow. And bear that in mind when you put your shoes back into your case. 

The food in the restaurant was excellent. We had no dietary complaints at all. And staff were good in asking how spicy you want you curry dishes to be. The staff were always polite, smiley, and helpful. 

The large outdoor pool was like bath water it was so lovely and warm, and a lovely view of the birds and water gardens. 

One thing to always bear in mind in Asia including Sri Lanka but there are days throughout the year when alcohol cannot be served. Full moon’s for example. We had one day (11th  February).  So check dates and pre-order beers for your in-room fridge before religious or festival days. 

We highly rate this lovely hotel. We strongly recommend it.","Wonderful hotel with so much wildlife","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r993649204-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

At check-in we were greeted with a shoulder massage and the most warmest of welcomes, we then were shown our water villa which was huuuge. The room was finished to a very high standard and we even welcomed the ‘Marshall’ Bluetooth speaker for us to play our Spotify tunes on. The only item lacking in our room would have been a coffee machine of some sort (Nespresso?).

I had researched this hotel extensively before arriving, but I didn’t quite appreciate just how beautiful its setting and location is. The wildlife on show is so unique, from the peacocks, kingfishers, crocodiles, monkeys, even distant sounds of elephants. Unless I go on an African safari I doubt I will stay at such a unique hotel as this.

The food was fantastic, I was there on half board basis and it was 5-course dinners each evening. My only suggestion would be to chill the wine bottles a bit more as we did have a few bottles of white wine that were not the coldest.

The staff were sooo friendly, you can tell they have been trained to the highest standard (gardeners stopped and got off their bikes as we passed them, reception staff stood up to greet us as we passed them too). Special mention to our butler ‘Damit’ who was so helpful to us, and drove us to and from dinner when it rained!

Large bathroom with toilet, roomy shower with nice toiletries, bath & double sinks.
We were 3rd from the end, furthest away from restaurant/bar/pools but had no difficulty walking - less than 10 minutes on the flat, through the lakes/paddy fields, enjoying the bird life. There are buggies to collect/drop off in case of rain (which unfortunately we had everyday at some point) & at night.
We were allocated a “butler” - we tend to think of a Jeeves-type character in wing collar & tails - in reality, our butler, Diman, was a lovely lad who set up our phones so we had the his contact details & he had ours, so we could always text when we needed a buggy. He also arranged for the mini bar refills & laundry. 
Very nice bar, with a top level that looked across the waterways to Sigiriya Rock. Lovely barman, Deepal.
Beautiful, large pool with sun beds. The waterways/ grounds are extensive & beautifully maintained. However, I wouldn’t recommend this resort for people with toddlers, as you would constantly be trying to keep them away from water.
The food was ok. On our 1st evening, the chef went around each table - we asked him about Sri Lankan food & he offered to cook us a special curry the following evening. It was good (although our guide felt the curries were a bit generic when we told him the next day what we’d had) - I would recommend if you go down this route, you ask exactly what you’ll get & the price… we found it expensive for what we had.
Overall, we would thoroughly recommend SWG & would return.

"0","988820989","en","10416524",,"General Manager","989534429","en","2025-01-16","David de Silva","Hello Mandy, 

Firstly thank you for having decided to book and stay with us and I am delighted that you enjoyed some aspects of the property. Please accept my most sincere apologies on behalf of the entire team for any dissatisfaction your encountered. To be very honest I was in-fact expecting this review as your driver did threaten the front desk staff upon departure that he would ask you to write a scathing review of the hotel. I am surprised and much saddened that having stayed for 2.5 days in the hotel, that you did not bother to bring to the attention of the Management, the stressful situations you claim you were encountering yet you were able to find the time during your holiday to post such a detailed explanatory review not only on booking.com, the platform via which you booked but also on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately this is not a very practical or helpful scenario for both yourself and us as this could have been discussed had we been alerted during stay and solved with a win-win situation for all parties. I have spoken with Diman, your butler in order to ascertain the other side of the coin and I also called and spoke to your driver whose account totally contradicts with what has been stated in your review. I invited him to come back to the hotel when he is in the vicinity so I could further discuss his accusations.     

I normally do not do this but for the benefit of future customers who would read your review, let me take this opportunity to respond to each point mentioned as some recollections do seem to vary. The issue at heart here is simply the fact that we did not offer free accommodation for your driver as he wanted/expected. We do not have and we do not provide driver accommodation in the hotel. We provide drivers and guides with all 3 meals free in our employee dining outlet and the front desk shares details of locations outside the hotel where driver accommodation can be booked. This has been the norm since the inception of the hotel in 2017 and no one has had an issue with this. Some hotels do have a separate sections where drivers are accommodated but not all hotels offer this as a default practice. I fully appreciate your concern about the welfare and sleeping arrangements of your driver but the implication was that we ‘threw him’ out of the hotel. Diman informed your driver that we do not have accommodation in the hotel and he was totally annoyed about this. He however did have all his meals in the hotel.    

CALLS DURING BUGGY RIDE - Each butler is allocated 5-6 villas and he serves as the point of contact during stay. Whilst driving you to your villa he did receive 2 calls from one of his guests which he had to respond to. He said the excused himself prior to the call and said sorry at the end of the call as per the norm.   

NEXT STOP HOTEL AT YALA – Whilst engaging in a casual conversation I believe you had mentioned that your next stop would be Yala Wild. As Diman had worked previously at Wild Coast Yala he had mentioned that it is a nice hotel. However what he should not have done is to make derogatory comments about your next destination which he confirmed he did and he apologizes for this mistake. I have severely reprimanded him for this and please do accept my most sincere apologies for this uncalled for statement. The young man now realizes the gravity of his comment and reassures that he will never repeat the same. 

DRIVER ACCOMMODATION ISSUE – Diman was concerned as to how you would react to the accusation made by your driver that he was ‘thrown’ out of the hotel without accommodation which is why he attempted to establish multiple contact with you in order to further clarify and explain the situation.

DINNER DELIVERY – Diman was the butler who drove the buggy which brought the food delivery to you villa together with Avishka and I was made to understand that you were seated in the living room when the food was delivered.  

WHATSAPP PROFILE PICTURE – All our butlers have been issued with official mobile phones with whatsapp facility. Diman had reported that his phone had dropped in the water during the rainy weather and we sent his phone to a shop in the town to be checked/repaired. In the meantime he had inserted the work sim into his personal mobile and was using it hence the reason why you saw his picture and whatsapp caption which reflects his personal status and definitely not his work status. This has been changed until such time he receives his work mobile. 

In conclusion, I understand from Diman that you had given a tip of Rs 2500/- and expressed satisfaction with your stay. In addition to this it was your driver who called the hotel front desk via the landline and said that he will instigate a negative review. This sadly does happen on occasions when a driver is not given all what he expects and it seems to be the case in this scenario. 

I trust that my response clarifies the situation and my sincere apologies once again.
Enjoy the rest of your time in Sri Lanka.
Warmest regards

David de Silva

The resort is set in an idyllic location, surrounded by lush greenery with stunning views of Sigiriya Rock. The room was luxurious, spacious, and beautifully appointed, complete with a shared pool that allowed for a truly relaxing retreat. The design and atmosphere of the resort are exceptional, providing a peaceful and picturesque escape.
However, the experience was overshadowed by the behavior of the butler. Upon our arrival, he took us to our room via buggy, but during the tour, he took several phone calls in the middle of our conversation, which felt inconsiderate and unprofessional. He also gave unsolicited, negative advice about our next stop, Cinnamon Yala, warning us to cancel our booking due to alleged thefts at the property. This advice caused us unnecessary stress, but after checking reviews, we found no evidence to support his claims and chose to ignore them.
Things took another turn the next day when our driver informed us that he was initially told he could be offered accommodation, only to be later told this was a mistake.
 When I questioned the butler about it, he dismissed it as an error. I accepted this and told him that was fine. Later, after I returned from a tour, rather than checking in with me about my experience, the butler went directly to my driver’s car window to discuss the accommodation issue once again, essentially ignoring me. I was half way back to my room by foot when he then shouted after me. I started to walk back to see what he wanted but he only wanted to offer me a lift in the buggy. I politely refused as was already on foot.
To make matters worse, later that day, I received a voice note from the butler reiterating that the driver had been wrong about the accommodation. Then, that evening, when I ordered room service, the butler showed up with the server and asked my husband where I was. I came out in my dressing gown to once again have to listen to him blaming the driver for the misunderstanding. I had already accepted it as such and was surprised that I was being called and voice noted and now visited in person to discuss the situation again. This meant my dinner experience and evening were also ruined. 
What was most shocking, however, was that after we had left the resort to continue our travels, the butler called our driver to inquire once more about why we were upset. Our driver, understandably frustrated, had to block his number, as this persistent, unprofessional behavior continued even after we had left. The driver was equally upset by the treatment he had received.
Additionally, the butler’s WhatsApp profile picture had a caption that read, “I don’t have an attitude, I just have a personality you can’t handle,” which I found highly inappropriate for someone in a guest-facing role at a luxury resort.
While the beautiful setting and luxurious accommodations are certainly worth noting, my stay was significantly impacted by this unprofessional behavior. I also want to acknowledge the other staff members who were friendly and professional, especially Avishaka, our server at the restaurant, who made a positive impression.
For the price and reputation of Water Garden Sigiriya, I expected a much higher level of service. Unfortunately, the unprofessional actions of the butler overshadowed what should have been a memorable stay. I hope that management takes this feedback seriously, as the resort itself has great potential, but service needs significant improvement.","Lovely setting but sadly marred by one staff member","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r988820989-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Spotting leopards on safari is rare—but there’s many other amazing species to ooh & awe over.   Bring binoculars!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Friend and I stayed at Tribe for 2 nights during our 16 day tour of Sri Lanka.  For being in the middle of the jungle, the accommodation is very nice and rustic in the expected ways—jungle sounds are exotic while going to sleep and awakening.  (The cabins are screened on 2 sides).

Dinner menu had a variety of choices but I highly recommend the Smoke & Fire Feast if not going typical Sri Lankan.  The bbq chicken was fantastic.  

Breakfast up in the tree canopy was magical.  Dining on a huge, delicious breakfast (we opted for the Sri Lankan breakfast) while watching birds and monkeys at eye level in the surrounding canopy was magical.  The carmelized onion sambol was my friend’s favorite.  

What sets this property apart from most of the other places we’ve stayed is the attentiveness of the staff.  In particular, Bandara was so helpful and kind.  I asked if I could take a morning walk on the property and he took me in the early morning on a short hike to bird watch.  He also generously loaned me his bird book so I could familiarize myself with the birds.   It was Bandara who made sure our meal orders were in and customized to our liking.   He also answered our barrage of questions about wildlife and culture as if we were the only guests he had to attend to.  Very gracious.","Attentive staff sets this property apart.","2025-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r990563438-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

EXCELLENT hospitality! Every staff we came across was very responsive and was nothing short of obliging, polite and helpful.  Lilan (the General Manager) definitely has a good team working there.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with them.

Weather-permitting, breakfast was served on an elevated platform built amongst the trees, level with the tree canopy. It was a wonderfully relaxing environment.  For lunch, we could choose to eat at the dining hall or have it delivered to our room. Dinner was served under the stars and by candlelight.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the F&B manager, Sudath Bandara. He is a constant, reassuring presence making sure all things run smoothly not only for our meals, but also steps in to help in logistics arrangement when Lilan is  not around.  Any request was promptly attended to.  A big Thank You to Bandara!  I should also mention Nalaka, another F&B staff, who is attentive and courteous.

The only downside is the location of the place. It is reachable only by a 15 minute jeep ride along bumpy tracks. (Ordinary passenger cars would be damaged by those tracks.)  The drive to the National Park entrance is about 45 minutes, with about 30 minutes of that along bumpy dirt tracks. We left by jeep at 5:15am but only managed to get into the park after 6:30am (including buying park tickets and queueing behind more than a hundred jeeps already ahead of us).

To sum it up, Tribe Yala's location is somewhat far to the park entrance compared to many other resorts/glamping places). But despite that, I can recommend it as a comfortable respite and for its outstandingly attentive and responsive staff!","Wonderfully comfortable stay, Attentive and responsive staff.","2025-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r989755166-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

The common spaces are fantastic with many factory details left in tact.  While the rooms are slightly dated and could benefit from more power outlets, they had to fit hotel rooms into a tea factory.   The views are spectacular and as an added bonus, the grounds are still a working tea plantation.  Most meals are buffet style - we were happy with the selection, though a bit more fresh fruit would have been appreciated.  The staff are kind and helpful.  

The area itself does not have a lot of attractions, so you need to know where you are going and why.  If you like rolling hills, serenity, and tea (emphasis on tea), you will love this place.  If you are looking for action and/or lots of activities, this may not be the place.

It is well worth every penny the standard and presentation of the food was incredible. We also enjoyed the buffet one night and the live singing. 
Would highly recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a winding road up to it but well worth it for the views and the temperature is definitely a bit cooler here.","Heritage Tea Factory","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r1000670764-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The staff were all so proud of their service; polite; extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the history of the Tea Factory. It was like stepping back in time 100 years and we truely loved the experience. 
Turndown service was memorable and the effort to craft an elephant from towels was very special from our floor room boy Jayapraka.

Room and bathroom were very nice (bed was hard). Only complaint - no air con, only a very noisy ceiling fan. I know it's cooler in the mountains, but it was still warm (luckily, the windows opened and there was a cool breeze).

The Highlands area is everything we hoped for, and the Heritance Tea Factory provided us with the absolutely premium location and experience.
Not only did we get to visit the onsite organic tea factory and fields, but the original engineering is in place, and running, which thrilled my husband!
We had the most magical wedding anniversary, including a gastronomic experience onboard the  TCK6685 classic railway carriage, complete with Conductor, personal Chef and live music, and a surprise cake just for us! The train even moves! Worth every £ for the evening!
A massage and whole body cleanse in the Spa, given by the wonderful Ari, was heaven sent.
The hotel rooms are beautiful,  converted tea factory spaces; extremely opulent and a great two nights sleep.
The Gardener gave us a personal tour of the English garden, which was perfect. There are plenty of hiking, tea picking and other activities on offer.
The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us but we’d personally give a shout out to Sivakumar, the restaurant staff, especially the Manager, and our Room Man, Sajeeshan.

As other reviewers noted, the navigation to the hotel is a bit tricky, but we definitely were rewarded by the view once there.  Our family had been traveling quite a bit, so we were looking to relax and enjoy the amenities offered at the hotel.  From start to finish, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed the tea experience - learning the process of tea-making from picking to processing to tasting.  We also enjoyed High Tea on the terrace one afternoon.  Everything was delicious and there was so much food provided, we didn't need much dinner that evening.  Our favorite experience was the dinner in the train car our first night.  We didn't know what to expect, but the experience was beyond anything we had imagined.  The food, once again, was delicious, and the uniqueness of the traveling train experience was a delight.

Service - Amazing, 5 stars. Anything you need you simply send a WhatsApp message and it is sorted for you within minutes.

Food - every meal was delicious. We chose full board and it was the best decision. The chicken fried rice was delicious. Having breakfast on the treehouse with the most epic views.

Safari - best location for safari. Tribe is so close to the national park. The driver and your guide really know their stuff. We got so lucky and saw a leopard, two sloth bears, elephants and much more.

Thank you so much to everyone at Tribe Yala for making this an unforgettable trip. Special shout out to the manager, cook and safari guide.","Honeymoon trip of a lifetime","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r965380114-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

Every aspect is well taken care of from the check-in itself. The staff is wonderful and very attentive. We stayed in ""Leopard"" tent which was equipped with all luxury amenities. The tent has a front Jacuzzi pool. Comfy beds, mini bar, tea/coffee, AC, Hot water and Wi-Fi is ready to keep your comfort level high. 

We stayed HB basis and the meals were super delightful. The dinner was served outdoor alongside with a bonfire. Luckily, the sky was super clear at that night and we were able to capture amazing Milky Way shots. The staff were kind enough to switch off the excess lights for us to get a good night shot after other guests left. Breakfast was served on their Tree Deck with amazing green view. Again, the food was superb and we had an opportunity to have a chat with the chef too. Support staff did amazing job. They were well trained and know what they were doing. Kudos !

Overall excellent stay and would like to visit again soon. Special thanks should go to Mr. Senura, Duggy, Dinesh, Ruwanjith and the Tribe team for all the arrangements. Keep up the superb work.

You'll be greeted at the main road by one of the property's safari 4x4's, which immediately sets the tone of the stay. You're then driven to the beautiful property (which blends seamlessly into the landscaped) and provided a cold towel and fresh juice to cool you down, whilst you're given information about excursions and mealtimes. 

The tents are distributed sparsely enough to afford an absolute sense of privacy, while mealtimes were a fine opportunity to natter with other guests and share stories of the day's adventure, whether up in the treetop, or beside the bonfire. The a/c was top of the range and cools the entire tent down. While it is tented accommodation, it's luxurious, well-decorated and tightly sealed. Happy to report we found no bugs inside! 

Food is prepared to order and executed with aplomb - again, easy to forget that you're in the jungle! We recommend the Sri Lankan breakfast and the grilled platter for dinner (mixed fish and meat).

I am generally quite squeamish about certain things, but after day 1, I decided against the indoor shower and opted instead for a cold morning shower outside. An experience I would repeat again, and again. 

The other highlight of the property is the plunge pools, which every tent has - the perfect remedy for a tired body after a day's jungle trekking and safari.

Escapism at its finest and worth every penny and minute of time spent there.","We quickly relaxed into jungle life","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r941269141-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

The beds are comfy and the room itself is so cozy. Food is delicious, the staff is really lovely and helpful with anything you might need and they will pick you up by jeep from the main road.
There is a terrace in the property with a really nice view on the NP where you can enjoy your breakfast or some drinks for sunset.
Also, they organized a full day safari tour including the lunch by the river and what a day ! Our driver did a fantastic job and our guide explained many things to us and answered all our questions. We've seen all the basic animals but also 15 elephants, 1 male leopard and the sloth bear. Even though Yala NP is well known to be super crowded, which we were afraid of, the team of Yala Tribe got the priority line tickets for us to be the first to enter and we were the only jeep in most of the places we've been to. So a thousand yes to do the safari with them.","Wonderful stay","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g20950227-d21505089-r940754721-Tribe_Yala-Uddhakandara_Southern_Province.html",

On this occasion we made it our base and stayed 10 nights. The hotel had had a refurb since our friends stayed with a much larger pool being installed and a beautiful terrace and lawn area in front of the beach. 

All the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The hotel itself is decorated in a clean minimalistic style with quality furniture and linens. Our room was spacious and well set out, leading directly onto the swimming pool. Large bathroom with double shower enclosure, separate toilet and large sink and vanity area. I particularly loved the lightweight cotton robes and wish I had been able to purchase one! The usual towelling hotel robes are always way too thick and bulky for me so these were perfect. 

The breakfast was wonderful. A selection of fresh fruit and fresh juice followed by toast and a choice from the menu of eggs or pancakes plus tea and coffee served free of charge until lunchtime. 

We had a couple of lunches which were again very good quality but the highlight for us was the chef’s curry banquet which we pre ordered and was the best we had throughout our stay. Such a wonderful selection of dishes, all incredibly tasty and the curry was cooked to personal taste in terms of spiciness.

We sat and watched the sunset most nights and the view out over the beach was stunning. The beach itself is large with beautiful soft sand and is a surfing beach and as such the waves are quite big so as a weak swimmer I wasn’t brave enough to go in further than my thighs as some of the breakers are quite fierce. However the sea is lovely and warm. Having the fantastic pool to use means not having to brace the waves!

The sunbeds around the pool are exceptionally comfortable and complimentary beach towels are provided. 

All in all a fabulous stay and somewhere I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for a bit of understated luxury in a beautiful location.

The owner(Lahiru) and his friendly staff did everything possible to make my stay memorable and extended there Sri Lankan hospitality at every opportunity which was both helpful and refreshing. There relaxed and flexible nature was great and anything required was efficiently arranged with no fuss or drama.

The food was excellent with an extensive menu of local and international choices along with ""special meal nights"" being provided  three times weekly which show cased the best of Sri Lankan fare which was a pleasure too experience and super delicious. 

The surf instructors were top level and went above and beyond to ensure that I improved my surfing skills in a safe and non judgmental manner with nightly video reviews of the days surfing sessions which was very helpful individually and entertaining for the group. There was also a Sunday surf theory workshop which was helpful and fun group activities and nights out arranged to explore some of the local sites & venues which was great for mixing with the other surfers and locals alike.

On arrival we were a little doubtful as The Sergeant’s House is just off the busy coastal road.  However, once inside the walls, The Sergeant’s House proved to be a peaceful oasis full of lush planting, including wonderfully scented frangipani trees.  The pool and pool area with dining loggia were beautiful.  
The ‘bungalow’ we stayed in was attractively furnished with good quality beds, pillows and linen.  Our outdoor bath and shower were a treat with lovely toiletries.  
Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all excellent.  We particularly enjoyed the delicious fruit plates at breakfast.  
We each enjoyed a massage whilst there, which were great.  
All the staff at The Sergeant’s House were very friendly and helpful, particularly the manageress who glided serenely around the house helping us with wifi and booking tuktuks.  
The hotel’s small private beach across the road meant that we could enjoy a swim in the ocean as well as in the lovely pool, which wends its way around the hotel interior.  We thought The Sergeant’s House was excellent and hope to visit again.","Beautiful, peaceful oasis in busy seaside town - private beach","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r939735862-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We booked the grand suite for 8 nights and 9n entering it exceeded my expectations. The room is huge tastefully decorated spotlessly clean. The bathroom is beautiful and there is even a small kitchen area. The veranda overlooking the pool was a gret place to have our morning coffee. The grounds make you feel like you are in a tropical rain forest and the pool and separate jacuzzi are lovely. Breakfast was a delight and they adapted every morning to our tastes. All of the staff are amazing and friendly. And the general manager is so lovely greeting us personally every morning asking about our stay and if there is anything they can do for us. All the staff were a credit to this beautiful place. Ps the private beach is stunning feels like your on a tropical island. I wish our stay was not ending tomorrow. Would not hesitate to come back.

Everything was spotless pool/beach towel, shower towels, air con, fans, a bath, outdoor shower and a lounge sitting area. 
The pool is gorgeous, it feels very tranquil with the greenery around and chilled relaxing music. The private beach across the road is also a lovely little extra to our stay.

The staff could not have done anymore for us if they tried, very helpful and friendly too. The breakfast was wonderful, fresh fruit a choice of yoghurt cereal before choice of eggs or pancakes. 
Such a shame we only had one night to stay, but it will definitely be on our list for a longer visit next time to Sri Lanka. ","Such a beautiful tranquil place!

There is a well maintained pool that goes around the dining area starting shallow and then going deep. If you have younger kinds or non swimmers keep an eye out when they are in the pool.

( I called them at 7pm the day before we planned to travel, after office hours, the mangers answered, and when I requested for menus, she sent me menus via WhatsApp) The villa was gorgeous, ( the site doesn’t  do  justice to the place at all) delicious food and staff made us feel at home. We had 7 adults and 3 kids, a 6 year old, 1.5 year old and a 5 months baby, and booked the family unit which has 3 separate rooms and attic. The beds were comfortable and room was spacious, one had an extra bed. It is more like a colonial house, has old world charm and modern amenities. Kids were in the pool most of the time and because there is a patio cum dining area facing the pool, the rest of the family too could sit and read and watch kids play and have a blast. 
We opted for Sri Lankan for lunch and for breakfast continental breakfast and seafood lasagna and bbq chicken and salad for dinner. Impressive that they even had hot chocolate for breakfast, and fruit platters with 4 or 5 varieties of fruits, juice and enough tea and coffee. 
The villa has a private beach just across Galle road, it is like you are not in city, and once you cross the road, the beach is gorgeous. The garden is a place to read and just do nothing and sit and look at fish in the ponds. Forest and beach vibes both at one place. 
Absolutely loved the whole experience and I proved that I am the best when it comes to planning holidays 😁 
I would recommend the villa to anyone looking for a holiday. It is affordable and so worth for the price you pay. And if they have availability they let you check in early and check out late, these small details matter me as I’m an inbound travel agent.  I forgot my phone charger and the managers was so kind to send it via post to me, and no I didn’t pay for postage. These little things matter to me, it is the people what makes a place amazing sometimes. Thank you team for having us and hoping to come again.","Family holiday","2022-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r849761059-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Nestled towards the (quiet) end of the stunning Kabalana Beach, The Sandhya is the crown jewel in Ahangama's burgeoning hotel and tourism scene. From smiling security and housekeeping to the excellent service team led by Taranja, the staff are unbelievably friendly, professional, and attentive in all the right ways. The food and cocktail menu are a culinary tour de force. Try the tuna tataki (ideally washed down with signature cocktails such as Sand & Sun or Gold Dust), it is literally my favourite meal in the world. The Sandhya delivers six-star-level confort, world-class design (wait until you see the iconic floating staircase) and landscaping, and high-end interior and amenity elements. No expense has been spared in ensuring their guests' receive an unmatched customer experience. Crucially, I don't say any of this based on one visit. I've stayed at The Sandhya around a dozen times over 5-6 years and the standards never slip, if anything they improve every year. If you can swing it, try out the Director's Suite - it is a genuine triumph in every way imagineable! Overall, the Sandhya is simply unmatched. It is a must-stay property if you're heading to Ahangama, which you should be! Oh, and the no kids policy may not be for everyone but it's a hit for me!","The Sandhya: the crown jewel in Ahangama's burgeoning hotel and tourism scene","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d12225146-r945021710-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The paradox of the imposing yet inviting, luxurious yet natural entrance makes you gasp and grin with expectation before you even step into the elegant interior. There are local touches everywhere...subtle but prevalent, all the same. The smiling welcome when the gate slides back to give access to your Tuk Tuk or your airport transfer; the shoes carefully lined up on the side of the stairs; the aromas and the gifts on the reception desk, the wooden key rings and the leather accessories. You know you need to check-in but you're too busy wondering when you will have time to photograph all the magnificently designed angles. More paradox...minimal, clean, symmetrical with modern-inspired furniture straight out of a magazine feature but cosy, warm, natural materials exuding comfort and that feeling of home at the same time. The boutique hotel's signature staircase allows the floor-to-ceiling windows space to breathe, and the stunning view is constant: day or night. Breathtaking! The concept is easy and simple but remarkable. It's a nine-room home with a lovely team there to make your stay unforgettable. But do they feel like staff waiting on you hand and foot? That would be too stifling, no. They are always there when you need them but this is more like being in a shared villa with friends (who you don't have to see if you decide you want your privacy). Open kitchen, honesty bar, a fabulous breakfast menu, lunch and dinner, board games, reading material, coffee-table books, a pool and garden, but - more importantly - a quiet corner of Kabalana beach, just metres from the azure waters and the waves. It's heavenly! The music, the daily fresh juices and fruit, the surf lessons (should you opt for some), the stretch of sandy beach, the access to everything else on your to-do list, the shared dinner or gatherings if you are fortunate enough to be there on a special occasion (like New Year's Eve with bubbles and fireworks) are carefully curated to make sure you build some unforgettable memories. You could be perched on the bar having a drink with the owner, running along the sand by sunrise, or lying on your sunbed chatting to a couple about their honeymoon. And, if you're alone, you will feel totally at ease doing your own thing in the lounge area or the dining room, tapping away at your laptop or reading your book, safe in the knowledge that someone is always around if you fancy a bite to eat or a refreshment, a massage, some tips on activities in the area or help planning your stay...and wherever you are in the hotel, you are always overlooking the garden and the sea. Magical! The Sandhya is a boutique hotel with a difference. It didn't feel like being in a hotel at all, but it had all the trimmings of a luxury resort. Sri Lanka was amazing, so being able to couple that up with accommodation I never wanted to leave, made every part of my itinerary a moment of anticipation. Did I mention lying in bed watching the waves or the gorgeous bath-robes and the super comfy bed? Too much for one review. I would go back in a heartbeat. Thank you for a great Sri Lanka experience to the entire team!","A PERFECT SANCTUARY","2024-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d12225146-r944937920-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This hotel is for those who appreciate good taste and Scandinavian design. Unlike large, facility-packed hotels, this one charms with its minimalism, showcasing exceptional design that’s both appealing and tasteful.

The beach adjacent to the hotel boasts a five-star view, making it a haven for surfing, swimming, or simply enjoying a leisurely walk. Despite the vibrant activities it offers, the hotel maintains a serene atmosphere, ensuring a peaceful retreat for all guests. 

Everything about this place is top-notch, from the quiet ambiance to the responsive nature of the owner. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a sophisticated yet serene getaway in Sri Lanka. We will definitely be back.

This place is magical.
It is a very small luxurious hotel.
The location is absolutely fantastic right on a quiet, long, beautiful beach. Guests have direct access so no need to take anything when going for a swim or a walk. 
The beach is quiet but with all facilities including surfing lessons and hire. 
The hotel is built around its privileged location so there are stunning sea views from every room.
We stayed on director’s suite for our special occasion and wow! Really spacious room with to balconies with the most incredible view. 
Big comfortable bed, fresh white cotton linen, robes, double walk in shower and vanity, fabulous bath with a view ( salts provided daily), huge dressing area, several large mirrors, a/c, speaker, impeccably decorated, no effort or expense has been spared. 
The theme continues in the whole hotel.
The food is fresh and cooked to perfection. Healthy tasty breakfast is included. We did explore a few other recommended restaurants but the best meals were at the Sandhya’s restaurant. Do try the tuna, best we have ever had.
The staff are incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and professional and accommodate everything we needed: transport, recommendations, I had the most incredible massage in my room which got rid of all my muscle aches! It is a very personal service and this is a big plus for us. 
An absolutely magical time in a small,  quiet, stylish hotel that catered for every single of our needs in the most privileged location.
 Perfect as a romantic location or simply somewhere to recharge batteries.

Me and my boyfriend travel a lot around the world and stay in hotels like this a lot. None of them were as attentive and warm as this one! The feeling when you walk through the door and see this incredible beautiful view and atmosphere in front of you was absolut beautiful. Our room was perfect-very clean, the food was very good so we ate there every day and the outdoor area was great as well. Also a big compliment to the staff! They were always courteous and always with a smile on their faces.

My wife and I stayed here for 8 days - and everything about our stay has been flawless.

The initial communication with the hotel was very serviceminded. Without asking we got offered a discount on the airport transfer, since we were staying for 8 days. Furthermore all our questions were replied very fast - we felt welcome even before arriving.

Hotel staff did an excellent job. They seemed to be at our disposal all the time - but still without being ""in our faces"". That is a fine line - and they certainly got that right. A lot of other hotels could learn from that.

Breakfast was from 8 to 12 - so no need to set the alarm to make it. Great menu with a lot to chose from. We had something different every morning.

The rest of the day there were also a lot of opportunities - varying from snacks, open sandwiches and nice smoothies to a great dinner menu with starters, mains and desserts. The kitchen staff never let us down - we tried to go through the entire menu, but didn't make it. Would have required another 4-5 days :) Every meal was absolutely stunning. The portions are great - and the seafood out of this world.

The overall feel of the hotel was really nice. It made you feel like you actually were at your own exclusive beach house - situated right on the shore. The fact that there are only 10 rooms in the hotel - and that it is ""adults only""  - added to that feeling. There is a laid back and stressless atmosphere - amplified by the lounge like music filling the common/dining area.

Rooms are great - the high ceiling adds to the airy feel. A/C working great - and combined with the ceiling fan, there was never a moment we couldn't adjust to the temperature that we wanted.

Time to wrap up this review.

We are frequent travellers - and have stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels. Still this is overall one of our best hotel experiences - and all the above resulted in a 5 star stay. We can only give The Sandhya our absolute best recommendations - and will do so, to everyone who wants to hear about our trip to Sri Lanka :)

Thank you - look forward to coming back.","Book it - you will not regret :)","2023-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d12225146-r928222182-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Abbiamo amato la doccia doppia con acqua sempre calda (cosa molto rara in sri Lanka) e la cromoterapia. Tutte le camere hanno una vista sull’oceano meravigliosa da cui si vedono due spot di surf e la sera ci si può godere il tramonto dalla propria stanza.
La colazione è deliziosa e servita con grande stile. 
La hall è un capolavoro di architettura e il giardino con lettini di fronte alla spiaggia è perfetto per rilassarsi e leggere un libro. 
A questo posto che mi è rimasto nel cuore do il massimo dei voti e, alla mia quarta esperienza in sri Lanka, lo considero l’hotel migliore del paese.

The property is like a really nice boutique hotel you might find in a much more developed place.  Sandhya is a diamond in the rough, but still remains authentic to Sri Lanka.  It does not pretend to be something it is not. The rooms are immaculate, the air conditioning is just right, the beds are extremely comfortable.  The rooms could not be more comfortable.  There are no children permitted at Sandhya and so it is an ideal place is you are looking to get away and find some peace and quiet.  I believe there are less than 10 rooms, so it never feels crowded, even when it is full.  The food is excellent, the lounge chairs are comfortable and the outside are, pool etc are very well maintained and beautiful.  The facility is an all around beautiful place with multiple surf breaks within walking distance.  All that said, I have saved the best for last.  The staff at Sandhya is one of the most professional, friendly and attentive I have come across in all my travels.  Truly, the staff at Sandhya stands out and made our stay an absolute pleasure.  They find the perfect balance of availability to your needs and letting you enjoy your peace and quiet.  They helped us with all of our needs and were problem solvers when we needed them, particularly around transportation.  In addition to all of this praise, I need to include that the restaurant right across the street from Sandhya is one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  We were told by a Brit we met that it is the best food in Sri Lanka and I can believe that.  Perfectly executed dishes, great atmosphere and professional staff.

We had our dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We are vegetarian so were not sure if we would enjoy the buffet dinner.

Chef Balbeer, made us feel at home, clearly explaining all the different vegetarian dishes. Once he realised, we don't eat eggs, he said no worries and prepared rotis which we thoroughly enjoyed along with very tasty curries. Chef Balbeer went out of his way to prepare perfect potato bhajias, which my wife and I enjoyed.

The whole of the restaurant team provided service with a smile and would like to mention Ganesh for his exemplary service.

Firstly the highs . The wonderful staff . They are amazing and the restaurant food is superb . The girls in the spa are lovely and Mohan who took us on a 2 hour walk through the tea plantation was knowledgeable and kind . 
Sadly that’s it . The hotel is tired . The rooms  are dated . Nothing looks like it has been refreshed since the hotel opened . With the most outstanding setting there are no deckchairs . Anything soft to sit on would have been appreciated. 
Maybe they think people come for one night and move on , but this is a place to stay for a couple of nights for rest . 
Spend some money on this old grand dame and it would be amazing . As it is right now it’s just ok .","Views to die for but spend money on this grand dame","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r994105463-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Good wifi and water supply. 
We needed to use the heater at night but a comfy nights sleep otherwise with blackout curtains. Thank you Patmanathan for keeping our room clean and stocked up. 
The grounds are well maintained and they have a lovely small garden.

The staff were incredibly warm and attentive. A special shoutout to Imashi, who looked after every little detail and made our stay feel extra special. Dinner by Chef Thiran Fernando was a standout — he customized the meal to our taste and it turned out to be one of the best meals of our entire trip.

Another unique experience was the Ayurvedic consultation with their in-house doctor before our wellness session. It added a deeply personal and thoughtful touch, and made the whole experience feel truly holistic and rejuvenating.

The property is spacious, quiet and serene and the lawn by the lagoon is a great space to chill. The rooms are exceptionally large and very comfortable (we were in a luxury room in the ground floor overlooking the lagoon). The menu incorporates both healthy and regular options and all the dishes we tried were delicious and beautifully presented. It was especially  nice to see a lot of imaginative fusion dishes incorporating local ingredients (especially recommend the Negombo Coconut Cake and the woodapple smoothie). But the most impressive thing about the hotel (as always) was the outstanding staff. The service is really top-notch. My parents are elderly and therefore have some mobility challenges and specific dietary needs. The restaurant team (Aruna, Imashi, Ranmini, Nadeesha and Pasindu) went the extra mile to make sure that all their needs were fulfilled and that they had an enjoyable stay. Their genuine kindness and attentiveness made my parents feel truly welcomed and at ease. A warm thank-you also to the amiable Ravindu from Housekeeping for his warm and efficient service and for taking such good care of us all! His thoughtful care left a lasting impression on our stay and is much appreciated. The spa is well-appointed and our therapists Nuwan, Mahel and Insam were clearly skilled and well-trained. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Thank you Jetwing Lagoon for another wonderful stay!

Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb, dafür idyllisch an der Lagune und eine Straßenüberquerung vom Strand entfernt. In der unmittelbaren Umgebung war jedoch nichts. Das Hotel ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber sehr gut gepflegt. Mit seiner Farbgebung und seinem Stil wirkte es auf uns eher wie eine Reha- Klinik. Die Zimmer waren sehr groß, sauber und wirkten in ihrem Stil eher nüchtern. Vom Abendessen waren wir enttäuscht. Wir hatten uns für Kotelett entschieden. Dieses war sehr klein und mit hohem Fettanteil. Dazu gab es eine kleine Kartoffel. Es entsprach eher einer Vorspeise als einem Hauptgang. Das Frühstück bot eine große Auswahl vorwiegend auf asiatische Gäste abgestimmt. Eierspeisen und z B. Hoppers wurden frisch auf Wunsch zubereitet. Wir buchten uns noch zwei Massagen und bekamen eine der übliche ""Streichel- Wohlfühlmassagen"" im guten Preisverhältnis. Das Personal war stets sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Für unseren Kurzaufenthalt ein entspannter Urlaubsausklang. Für einen längeren Aufenthalt würden wir hier jedoch nicht buchen. Dafür wirkte für uns die Anlage selbst zu nüchtern (Reha-Klinik-Flair), der Strandabschnitt weniger einladend und uns fehlte Gastronomie in unmittelbarer Nähe. Uber zum Flughafen klappte problemlos.

We visited the boutique hotel and we could not agree more possibly the best stay in srilanka so far ! From pool floats to the rooms it was phenomenal. We were given the pool view room and a twin room. 
Note : If you are traveling solo best would be the twin room as it has an attic bed.

She even helped to arrange transportation for our excursion to Galle, having our luggage met at the most delightful restaurant there before our long haul flight back to the USA. It was wonderful being close to Unawatuna beach and the hustle and bustle, but being able to retreat to our oasis in the evenings. The kids loves Wijaya beach and seeing the giant turtles was a highlight, followed by great pizza! I loved my morning yoga in the courtyard with my Ceylon black tea.

The resort is so tranquil,  the food is amazing,  the manorism of the the staff is out of this world, a total contrast to the attitude of most UK employees,  they literally can't do enough for you,  and their kind nature seems to come from the heart.

My Wife and I were treated by Nuwan and Sunetha in the Spa for the weeks duration. I have never met such peaceful and respectful people, what an amazing culture. 

Each morning we have traditional ayurvedic medicines and a consultation with the ayurvedic doctor, one of two doctors who are super friendly,  understanding and knowledgeable,  hey and guess what.....they don't kick you out after minutes,  you can converse with them for as long as you like and they tailor your days treated to suit , literally out of this world attitude to health and nutrition.  We now have both doctors WhatsApp details. The doctors literally could not believe how long it takes to get an appointment in the UK or that you can only have 5 minutes with a doctor per appointment.  The uk medical system needs a massive shake up

The attitude of the staff is the same throughout,  whether it is reception,  restaurant or kitchen,  everyone knows your name and room number. They always communicate between departments,  so if you book a tour,  they automatically adjust your meal time and treatment without you having to think about it.

The 100m pool is so clear and warm.

The room service is so quick and tidy

The food is next level flavoursome and super healthy.

Even security are friendly.

The property is stunning. Brand new, with clean, modern architecture and a calm energy throughout. We had a partial sea-facing room, which still offered a beautiful view — you could sit by the window for hours and just watch the ocean and city fade into each other.

The interiors were tasteful — minimal yet warm — and the in-room experience was smooth throughout. It never felt flashy or overwhelming, just simple luxury done right.

One of the biggest highlights was dining at Avartana. If you’re visiting, don’t miss it. It’s not your usual Indian fine-dine — it’s a full tasting experience with a carefully curated menu, incredible plating, and an ambience that really sets the tone. The storytelling behind each dish made the night feel like more than just dinner — it was a whole experience.

Some worth mentions are their high tea in the evening, the views and sunsets are breathtaking everyday, we satyed for 5 days, and we went there every day without missing it.

Do try their hand made nachos if you get a chance, those were delicious.

Also, there is infinity pool facing the sea, a sky lounge as well, free casino travel.

If you go to casino balies is worth visiting.

Massive thanks to Rephan Castelino, who helped us throughout the stay — from small details to last-minute help, he was just fantastic. Super professional, and made everything feel effortless.

If you’re planning a honeymoon or just want a relaxed luxury stay in Colombo — this place is absolutely worth it. Great food, peaceful rooms, kind staff, and just the right amount of quiet luxury.","Thoughtful Hospitality, Great Food & Views — Our Honeymoon at ITC","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1014152876-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Colombo hotels seem to be in a race to provide the most luxurious facilities and best service. The ITC, opened just over two years ago, is a recent entry. The huge reception lobby on the second level gives a sweeping view of the ocean. The rooms are spacious and appointed nicely. There are some nice details, such as the lilly inlays in places like the room paneling and elevator flooring. The electrical outlets are all universal, accepting plugs from around the world. 

The staff were exceptional from the moment I walked in. I wish I had noted more names.

Suresh at the bell station helped me from the beginning and throughout my stay. Shaiya checked me  in.

I don’t usually write reviews, and I certainly don’t believe in writing negative ones—but whenever I experience something genuinely good, I always make it a point to appreciate it.

Recently, I had a reservation handled by a wonderful lady named Vidu from the ITC reservation team. What started off with a small misunderstanding could have easily gone downhill. But Vidu stepped in with such grace, professionalism, and empathy that it completely turned the situation around.

She didn’t just clear the confusion—she made me feel heard and respected. The way she calmly explained things and turned what could’ve been a frustrating experience into a pleasant one was nothing short of impressive. It’s rare to come across someone who combines competence with such warmth and emotional intelligence.

People like Vidu truly deserve recognition. She’s a shining example of what hospitality should feel like. Kudos to her—and to ITC—for nurturing such talent. It’s people like her who make a lasting impression.","Professional approach","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1006396064-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The whole place runs like clockwork under the eagle eye of Umberto, the Manager, whose staff cater to your every whim with a smile.

A special mention must be made of our butler Namal who was on the end of a phone (supplied by the hotel) to answer any queries and organise spa appointments (Bonita at the spa seems to have magical hands!) and the like.

The food is 5 star, the menu extensive and the portions huge. The whole team in the restaurant are efficient and friendly - we were looked after, in the main, by Baehum and Nawa with smiles however numerous our requests. And Ajidh, the bartender, mixes a great cocktail.

All in all this is the type of hotel we’ve always hoped to find - the luxurious tents on the beach with the glorious view of the sea make you feel as if you’re in your own paradise - and now we’ve found it. Even the occasional bouts of heavy tropical rain were an experience to enjoy.","Paradise found!!","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r996707817-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

But the biggest mention has to go to the beautiful staff and their warm and welcoming nature. Nothing was too much trouble and they all try so hard for their guests. Special shout out to Jude (who went to huge trouble

The hotel, although not brand new, is decorated with good taste and is carefully daily maintained. The territory is very spacious, with beautiful plants and organised in such a way that you practically do not feel other guests. The arrangement of the houses makes you feel as if you are alone by the ocean, in its immediate vicinity. We especially liked that everywhere in the hotel territory, except for the indoor areas, there are no concrete or asphalt paths, but there are well-groomed beach sand paths, which are surrounded by greenery.
The hotel has less than 20 rooms, we lived in an ocean villa/tent, but there are also garden villas, which are facing away from the ocean. The houses are partly tents, spacious, well and tastefully decorated with everything you need. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The outdoor shower room with flowers was especially beautiful.
The hotel pool is long and deep, you can really swim in it, not just dip in. The pool area, although quite small, is also comfortably furnished and has everything that a good hotel should have. There always were free sunbeds as every villa has it's own sunbeds and guests are mainly staying there.  
The hotel staff is well trained, very attentive and pleasant in communication. We especially want to praise and thank our personal assistant Malshan Wijewardana, this young man's professionalism, accuracy and wisdom far exceed his position in the hotel!
I also want to note the spa masseuse Bianca (I appologize if I slightly modified her name). Although the spa area is quite simply organised and decorated, Bianca did her job brilliantly every time I was there.
The a la carte breakfast had a wide selection for every taste, our various wishes were only met with a warm response. Since there are only various plantations in the area, we also ate lunch and dinner here. Food and drinks are not cheap at all for such a remote place, but all the dishes were of restaurant quality. It should be noted that there was also very good coffee here.
As a disadvantage, the location of the air conditioner in the room should be noted. It is located on the ground next to the bed and it is impossible to leave it turned on so that it does not blow directly into your face. So all 5 nights we slept without conditioner. We recommend moving the air conditioner to the bathroom area, then it will cool the tent evenly and unobtrusively.
Another warning is about the ocean rip currents. Read and learn about these currents, watch the ocean very carefully for 15 minutes to understand if the place you want to enter, does not have ocean rip currents. The beach is very wide, you can choose where to go swimming. It is best to do it in the shallow areas, which are every 50 meters on this beach. I think that the hotel management should inform and educate guests more about this phenomenon. Dangerous situations could be easily avoided if you are knowledgeable and informed about what to look out for, but can get into a big accident if you accidentally enter this current that pulls you into the ocean. Fortunately, my episode with this rip current ended well, because I knew what to do if the current pulls you into the ocean. However, it was an extremely unpleasant experience that could have been avoided if I had swum 50 meters further to the right or left. By the way ocean in general there was much calmer than in the south beaches of Sri Lanka.","Ideal place to enjoy undisturbed proximity to nature and unpretentious luxury","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r994117213-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

We made some bad accommodation choices on this trip – believing the trip or google reviews and ending up in some disappointing places. Not this hotel though – we loved everything about it. The ‘tent’ rooms were beautifully finished and furnished, comfortable bed, great showers and services/wifi etc. The food in the restaurant was excellent and very well-priced for the quality. A lovely beach, illuminated palm trees, great poolside bar and lounge…. Very good value for money also. The manager, Umberto, went above and beyond and seems to be on top of all the details of customer service and the logistics of a higher-end place like this. We would highly recommend a few days at this place to unwind and to laze, eat and drink fabulously, away for a few days from the general chaos of other parts of Sri Lanka.","an excellent choice","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r990813199-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

Thank you for your review. We are thrilled to hear that Koshika’s body scrub treatment left you feeling relaxed and pampered — she will be glad to know you had a wonderful experience. A head massage in a tranquil setting really is the perfect way to unwind, and we are happy you enjoyed it.

It’s also great to hear that our 100-meter pool added to your relaxation and it is indeed the perfect location to unwind after a rejuvenating treatment.

The staff were incredibly helpful and kind. The stay was designed with the physical and mental wellbeing in mind. For example, use of mobile phones was not encouraged for digital detox, although this was not mandatory. For physical detox, the meal ingredients are specially selected to ensure the food intake during the stay is healthy. In our stay, we opted for special Ayurveda treatments (Authentic abyanga - 60 minutes, foot and head treatments - 30 minutes) and we would like to recommend Nuwan, Sunetha, Mahel and Insam for relaxing treatments. Both the large 100 metre pool and the pool next to the beach add to this fantastic experience. Meals at the restaurants were served with a lot of care. We specifically enrolled to 'Balance and Bliss wellness package' for a single night stay. Compared to highly touristy places like Hikkaduwa, this place was very calm and there was no loud music. Therefore, we highly recommend Jetwing Lagoon Wellness for a calm stay in Negambo, Sri Lanka.","A Calm and Relaxing Stay","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r1002888141-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Остановливаемся в этом отеле уже второй раз. Это о многом говорит.
Очень чистый, светлый отель с приветливым персоналом и отличным хозяином. 
По факту:
Хорошие номера, огромная мягкая кровать, для ребенка тоже дополнительная кровать, а не какая нибудь раскладушка.
Современный санузел, все работает, горячая вода есть всегда.
В номере есть чайник, чайный набор, стаканы, кружки и даже тарелка с ножом для фруктов.
Хороший балкон, стол и стулья, большая сушилка для белья.
Уборка ежедневно, смена белья раз в три дня.
Мощный кондиционер и потолочный вентилятор.
Строят новый корпус, первый этаж уже готов, думаю там номера ещё лучше, они новые.
Есть генератор, поэтому отключение электричества не страшны.
Завтраки съедобные, но однообразные, на перекус нормально.
Отель закрыт на электронный замок, никто чужой не заходит.
Единственный минус на сегодняшний момент это не благоустроенный внутренний дворик, но думаю по окончании работ его приведут в порядок.
Отель расположен немного в стороне, поэтому шума с улицы нет.
До пляжа 5-7 минут по улице с кафе и магазинами.
Вернёмся сюда обязательно.
Спасибо!","Отличный отель на Шри.","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r1001265418-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Мы читали и слышали всякое, с чем можно столкнуться на острове, но в этом отеле никакие трудности и сложности нас не коснулись!
Теперь чуть больше полезных подробностей:
Расположение отеля вполне удачное. Не первая линия, но идти до пляжа совсем недалеко, минут 10. При этом он расположен не на основной улице, а, скажем так, в переулке, что избавляет от шума и суеты.
Персонал очень приветливый, все стараются, это чувствуется. Говорят на английском, можно с переводчиком в телефоне.
По масштабу отель небольшой.
Вход - по умолчанию закрыт (не проходной двор), свои заходят через электронный замок и карту. Соответственно, о сохранности имущества можно не беспокоиться. В номере есть сейф, без отдельной платы, с кодовым замком.
Ремонт свеженький, в светлых тонах, вполне приятно.
Местами есть неаккуратности в ремонте, но это мелочь.
Концепция интерьера такова, что он светлый, просторный, высокие потолки и без мебели практически. Шкафов нет. Функцию мебели выполняют конструктивные элементы стен (что-то вроде полок, столешниц).
Это касается и кровати - и это огромный плюс! То есть кровать - вроде как из камня, на котором лежит матрас (вполне хороший). Соответственно, кровать устойчивая, не скрипит совсем! )
Единственное - углы кровати - с ними надо быть осторожнее. Поскольку она белая, как и весь интерьер, бывает, не увидишь, и ударяешься об углы. После нескольких раз, вырабатывается рефлекс быть осмотрительней с этим )
Стены, кстати, из кирпича (или что-то вроде того), в общем, звуков из соседних номеров не слышно.
Такие стены и кровать - большие плюсы этого отеля, на мой взгляд.
Розетки - адаптированные. Спокойно включали и зарядники, и ноутбук. Никаких головняков с адаптерами не потребовалось.
Для ноутбука у нас в номере был подходящий столик. Также было кресло. В результате чего у меня было более-менее нормальное рабочее место.
Электричество на острове не особо стабильное, но в отеле есть свой генератор. Поэтому проблем с электричеством у нас не было, как и с водой. Один раз из-за переключения электричества сгорел блок питания у wi-fi роутера. Хозяева решили проблему буквально в течение 30 минут, пришли с электриком, всё сделали.
Есть балкон, там раскладная сушилка для белья. Вид на двор (где смотреть особо нечего, в общем-то).
Кондиционер отлично справляется с охлаждением, плюс есть вентилятор на потолке (мы им не пользовались).
Ещё есть чайник, и ложат чай, кофе (которые мы в номере особо не пили).
Полотенца есть - как в номере (меняют раз в 3 дня, вроде), так и пляжные в холле можно брать. А вот халатов не предусмотрено.
Предварительно, перед поездкой почитавши про Шри-Ланку, мы взяли с собой фумигаторы от комаров и т.д. )) Но они вообще ни разу не пригодились. Комаров тут мало и они маленькие. У нас в России (на Южном Урале) их намного больше. На всякий случай на ночь мы закрывали дверь балкона, так сказали при заселении. Из насекомых тут столкнулись с муравьями, которые очень любят фрукты ) В один момент их стало много, и уборщик что-то сделал, наверно, потом их не стало.
В номере есть небольшой холодильник.
Что касается питания - у нас были включены завтраки. Шведский стол. Выбор блюд совсем небольшой, но нам хватало, в принципе, подкрепиться с утра. Овощи (огурчики, помидорчики), яйца (по разному приготовленные), сосиски (не пробовали), тосты, фрукты (ананас, попайя, банан) и очень вкусные кексики. Была ещё каша, но на молоке, мы такое не едим )
Во дворе планируется бассейн, но это будет примерно года через 3, скорее всего, так сказала хозяйка. Пока там просто ровный грунт, даже без травы. Возможно, стоило бы его пока хоть газоном засадить.
В целом, повторюсь, мы остались доволь��ы отелем. Отличное соотношение цена-качество!","Хороший отель!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r995070759-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Только вернулись домой. Нам понравился и отель, и номер, и люди. Чистота кругом! Встретили соком и холодными полотенцами, пока заселялись. Заселение прошло быстро. Хозяева не говорят на русском, но все инструкции и подсказки подготовлены заранее на А4 на русском языке. Подсказали в каком направлении купаться, где кушать. Кто первый раз и вот вышел с машины, без карты и интернета, это удобно. Очень понравился приём! Номер тоже понравился. В номере 2 кровати, двухспальная и одноместная для ребёнка. Кондиционер, вентилятор,сушилка для вещей! Наверно тут всё было продумано до мелочей, чтобы мы могли отдыхать! Шампунь, гель, крем для тела, мыло. Чай, кофе, сухое молоко, сахар, чайник, в коридоре куллер с водой без ограничения. Есть услуга прачечной за небольшую плату. Чужим действительно не попасть на территорию, вход один и с ключом (ну или в звонок позвонить). Балкон, где жалюзи висят. Закрыт от глаз, отдыхаешь и наслаждаешься.
Приеду ли я сюда ещё раз? Безусловно да! Мне очень понравилось.
А какая тут природа! Кстати на самой территории нет обезьян, варанов или там змей. Можно абсолютно не боятся за себя и ребенка. Я прям специально читала отзывы и исключала те места, где писали, что пришли обезьяны или там пришёл варан. Я прям именно без всякой живности хотела. Мои ожидания оправдались. Нам вдалеке показали обезьян, варана на чужой крыше и его ещё  увидели на улице в ручье)) плыл, он не кусается. 
Но больше всего меня поразил павлины! Они как у нас голуби или воробьи свободно перемещаются по улицам! Будете идти на пляж, недоходя до coconat ресторана на 3м этаже слева  можно увидеть павлина с красивущим хвостом! Нереальные непередаваемые ощущения!
А ещё вернусь опять к отелю. Я мерзлячка, а мужу жарко. В номере пододеяльник, но муж попросил одеяло и принесли такой чудесный новогодний плед!!! (когда включали кондиционер, я накрывала ь дополнительно ещё и пледом поверх пододеяльника. А когда уезжали уже домой, предложили по завтракать рано утром в 6 утра! Очень приятна такая забота. Спасибо большое! Планируем  к вам приехать через год повторно!
PS спасибо жильцам из 204 номера, если вы читаете мой отзыв, то ваш доширак прям очень был кстати в один из вечеров с дождём мы его съели с удовольствием!!!
Кстати, в номере розетки разъёмы на все варианты, мы не покупали заранее переходники и на месте не пришлось покупать.
И комары нас не доставали, ни одного не видели. В номере была уже баночка с жидкостью от комаров, в розетку включали. Не знаю хозяева предоставляют или предыдущие жильцы оставили, но спасибо за такую заботу! А ещё!! Что мне понравилось, что есть тарелки, нож, доска разделочная! Очень удобно. А ещё в номере есть 2 тумбочки и один шкаф, есть вешалка и плечики. Вот реально, всё пр��думано, всё для удобства до мелочей. Всё есть, мы только щётки и пасту купили.
За время отпуска со светом и горячей водой тоже проблем не было.
(Огромный привет от семьи из g-03).
И ещё раз очередное кстати. Если пойти направо, как вышли из отеля, там в конце будет кафешка, там мы видели светлячков! Впервые в жизни вживую увидела светлячков!","Отличное место для отдыха","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r986469446-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Муж нашёл и выбрал этот отель, чему мы очень рады.
Отель светлый, чистый, приятно находиться. Уборка в номере каждый день. Белые полотенца и постельное белье отельное, хорошего качества. Хозяева очень стараются для  комфортного проживания гостей. Помощник очень добродушный, отзывчивый.
Завтраки вкусные и сытные: йогурт, фрукты сезонные (банан, папайя), яйца всех видов приготовления, сосиски, тосты, кекс вкусный, собственного приготовления. 
Высокие потолки, бесшумный лифт OTIS. 
Ещё планируется бассейн взрослый и детский. Так же большой плюс для семей, что не шумно, окна выходят во двор и нет шума с улицы. Рядом много кафе, ресторанов, магазинов, фруктовых ларьков. С детьми ездили на пляж Джангл бич, там волн нет, есть обезьянки, красивая, живописная бухта. 
Общались с другими туристами, которыми не повезло с отелем, жаловались на грязь, некуда повесить белье. Тут же отдельная большая сушилка для белья, есть своя  прачечная, можно отдать вещи на стирку. 
Мы остались очень довольны и отдыхом и отелем. Благодарим🙏❤️","Отдых с 2 детьми","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r982466505-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Such was the level of pre-arrival care provided by the wonderful Nuwan and his team - both during the booking process and our room preferences, as well as the message we received with information about our arrival and room (due to a very early morning arrival time). 
We arrived the the hotel just as dawn was breaking. The high wall that separates the property from the main road outside gives away nothing about just how beautiful it is. The design, as mentioned by many, is fresh and contemporary and the large windows looking out on to the ocean framed by palm trees give the illusion of a painting - interrupted only by the sound of the crashing waves. The sky was filled with hues of pink when we arrived... 
Our short stay at The Sandhya was flawless. Rooms are spacious, airy, well-apppointed, clean and filled with light. The vibe is relaxed all day, the food is delicious and the service is spot on. The staff were all kind and attentive, and efficiently handled all the arrangements in terms of restaurant reservations and transfers that we requested. 
The beach in front of the hotel is stunning - there are good easy waves for beginner surfers, and powder white sand for sunset walks. The location of the property is also great, as it is a short drive from Galle (don't miss a trip there), Koggala lake (don't miss this either!), as well as a number of beaches and restaurants in the wider area. 
A turtle laying her eggs on the beach in front of the hotel was my last memory of The Sandhya before I departed. So special!
Thank you Nuwan, thank you to the entire team for the most wonderful stay! I can't wait to return.

Location wises its also pretty good with decent number of options to eat&drink in walking distance or short ride. Galle Fort (which is “the must visit”) is also in ~20 minutes ride only.
Only the thing I would improve is to add more shadow for breakfast / lunch seating as it's not always easy to enjoy a meal at sun heat.
Overall, it was truly enjoyable stay and I hope will have a chance to come back. My five stars!","Close to be ideal","2022-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d12225146-r874476296-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The Sandhya is literally on the most beautiful tropical beach  (with amazing waves for surfing!). The rooms have an amazing sea view with floor to ceiling windows, you can see the most incredible sunrises and  sunsets from your room!

The staff is incredibly professional, so kind and will go above and beyond to make sure you are happy and you have anything you need at any point! They always surprise us with little treats (they baked our favorite cake as a surprise). They truly make you feel at home. We can’t thank them enough for their attention and kindness. 

The food is also delicious, everything is super fresh and home made! They have an amazing cocktail list too! 

I never post reviews but I can’t help it for The Sandhya - it’s such a special place! Without any doubt, our favorite place. Everything is beautifully presented and every little detail is thought through to make you feel at home.

They always replied so quickly and were of such great help. I would say the most helpful hotel we’ve ever stayed in!

When we arrived we were taken to our room and they had put out lovely balloons for our honeymoon and my husband had surprised me with some prosecco and flowers which was so lovely that he arranged with the hotel.

 The rooms are beautiful, so spacious and stylish and on the last few nights they even upgraded us to the best room as it was our honeymoon.

They also supply great toiletries in the rooms with added mosquito balm from a local Sri Lankan supplier than was great and very helpful. 

The help with our fit to fly PCR tests back to the uk was organised so easily that we didn’t need to worry at all and we also organised a taxi for a day trip which they even managed to get discount for us on.

The hotel is stunning with beautiful furniture throughout. 
An amazing location right on a stunning beach.

The food was great, as we were here for 6 nights we tried a lot of it and it was all delicious.

The road to the resort is a little rough but after that everything was perfect.

The staff greeted us and I must say the staff service  in our entire 4 day stay was excellent 
The staff were particularly accomodating and excellent with our kids 

We stayed in one of the kolaya villas which is really nice, it was your own space , large villa w large deck and your own private sand lawn , made for full relaxation, reflection and chill vibes
The outdoor waterfall shower was amazing and the villa itself has everything we needed 

The only potential difficulty we had was there were a lot of stray dogs and with toddlers we had to keep a close eye on them 

The facilities were great 
We enjoyed amazing breakfasts and meals at dinner 
The food was on point and I particularly found the Sri Lankan cuisines excellent (being Sri Lankan myself I feel im a fair judge) 

The pool and amentities were great , we enjoyed a movie on the beach, the shanti spa and my daughter had some henna done not to mention a daily visit to the pool

Overall it’s a place for full relaxation 
We did venture out to batticaloa each day but really you could spend the entire time at the resort and just chill 

We really couldn’t fault the stay and there were lots of little touches and nuances in the service that I haven’t listed but were excellent

Karpaha sands is a great destination 
A little out of the way
But well worth it 

Ty for a great time

II would like to thank  you for the feedbacks you have shared on your comment, the dogs around the property are stary dogs and mainly coming because of fishermen activities, cats too. Having said that we are trying to take care of them by feeding them in our staff restaurant and buying medicines for them. 

I also would like to apologies for the inconsistency of the quality of the food, i am personally looking into it and execute training to all the service staff to improve communication of meals requirements

The hotel was beautiful. We stayed in one of the ocean front suites and it was such a gorgeous room, with wonderful amenities and décor. We had our own sun loungers to use on the beach which was a lovely touch and the butler service was fantastic, it was very special to have breakfast brought to us in the morning to have on the veranda close to the ocean. The massage treatments were brilliant, and the swimming pool was lovely. The beach and ocean were beautiful. 

Unfortunately there were two areas that we felt needed improvement which is why we haven't given a five star rating. First, there a quite a few dogs that live/roam on the beach and on one day some of them got into a fight which was quite distressing to see, especially as one of the dogs became injured and was bleeding. There was also a cat in the restaurant area that was limping. It was unclear whether the hotel owns the animals or if they were wild, but either way it could be doing more to make sure the animals have good welfare, including medical treatments.

Second, the quality of the meals was inconsistent. On several occasions the dishes we ordered were missing key elements without any acknowledgment or explanation from the staff, which was disappointing given the cost, e.g. I ordered the wok fried rice with tofu, but it didn't have any tofu in it.  What was very frustrating though was that we had informed the hotel at several points (before our stay, when we arrived via a form which asked for dietaries) that I was vegan, but no one seemed to care/remember.  At dinner for example I was repeatedly brought an amuse-bouche which I couldn't eat, and when I asked if it was vegan they would take it away- no alternative was offered. In the afternoon the staff would bring cookies to the room which was a lovely touch, but again they weren't vegan. For such a high-quality hotel, the staff should know if guests have dietary requirements. The Sri Lankan food in the restaurant was very good but some of the other dishes lacked flavour.","Wonderful hotel, but some improvements could be made.","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r979373611-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

La piscine est superbe. Juste dommage qu'il n'y ait pas assez de chaises longues + parasols (indispensable !) autour de la piscine ! Ça fait un peu ""la guerre des chaises longues"" dès l'aube ! Vous voyez ce que je veux dire !?
Les massages sont exceptionnels et les masseuses ont des doigts de fée !
Les repas sont bons, mais pas tout-à-fait ce que nous attendions de ce niveau d'hôtel. Pas toujours très raffiné et beaucoup trop copieux ! Or, on déteste jeter de la nourriture !
Attendez-vous aussi à être réveillé assez tôt (vers 5h du matin ?). L'hôtel n'y peut rien bien sûr, mais c'est quand-même dérangeant. En effet, des chants hindoux, assez forts, provenant d'un temple tout près, vous réveillent dès 5.00' (ou même 4.45'?) + le passage du train vers 6.00,+ les aboiements de chiens... Pas toujours. très agréable si tôt le matin 🤪

The safari-style tents with outdoor shower create a very stylish and romantic ambience, the restaurant and bar offer lots of choice and consistently high quality food and drink. The location, off the beaten track, is stunning and relaxing.  The public spaces are beautifully designed with attention to detail, I could go on and on.  Umberto, the general manager strives to deliver a very personalised service and talks to guests on a daily basis. He even offered our 9-year-old to accompany him into the kitchen and help cook his pasta! 

Both the Sri Lankan and Italian dishes offered in the restaurant were delicious and fairly prices, as were the drinks.  We booked half-board and were very pleased that we weren't limited to a small separate menu but could choose freely off the normal menu, which had lots of options and huge portion sizes.  

Ash, our butler looked after us extremely well. When he saw us up for sunrise on the beach he offered to bring us a cappuccino.  He surprised us with a wedding anniversary cake and when after our meal, we returned to our room we find our bed decorated with towel art and flowers.  He arranged our beach bbq dinner and acted as our personal server during the evening, even taking photos and videos for us!  He also organised our cinema under the stars and brought us popcorn, it was a wonderful way to while away the evening. Karpaha Sands is the kind of place that truly relaxes you and lets you forget all your stresses and strains.  Sadly I didn't get round to trying the ayurvedic spa treatments, which looks very inviting and again were very fairly prices. All in all we were very sad to leave and would have happily stayed longer.

Our butler Banda went above and beyond to make us comfortable, and a special a shout out to Kumari for the wonderful three-day Ayurvedic spa treatments. Reasonably priced and highly recommended. 

Food was also excellent and aside from a couple of meals, we ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Lots of options available, from local favourites, to Italian seafood dishes, to BBQ private dining experiences. 

Lastly, access really isn’t as bad as some other reviews make out. Yes, the 2km track off the main road is a little bumpy in places but our driver had no problems, and getting around the local area by TukTuk is easily arranged.","Paradise on Sri Lanka’s East Coast","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r969635649-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

Saw a review that slammed the drive to the hotel. Yep its bumpy , and after a long drive the last thing you want....however...

After that , your hotel , the staff , the food  the rooms , everything is well worth a bumpy ride....which by the way is life....a bumpy road.

Your hotel caters for all. Small things matter,  the fact you go out of your way to greet everyone at sometime when they first arrive is lovely,  and makes your guests feel very welcome.

The food and choice is superb ( your Italian ,please add a bruschetta!!)..

Wish it was closer , but we won't we back sadly , all we can say is...if you are a potential guest...go there, you will not be disappointed","Well worth visiting","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r969509879-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

В отеле нас встретил управляющий с готовыми номерами, освежающими полотенцами и вкусным свежевыжатым соком.

Номер нам достался на 2 этаже. Номер большой, белоснежный с огромной кроватью. Белье, полотенца меняли кадые 3 дня, шампунь и гели пополняли каждый день. В номере был чайник и бокалы. Чай, кофе, сливки тоже докладывали каждый день.

2 бутылки воды были по приезду, а потом мы их пополняли в кулере на этаже. Также был сейф, сушилка для белья. Огромный балкон с соломкой от солнца.

Завтрак всегда один и тот же, но не надоел. Яйца в разных видах, горячие тосты, сосиски, кексы, йогурты, фрукты, свежевыжатый сок, чай или кофе, молоко, джемы и масло.

Отель чистый, ухоженный, персонал приветливый. Что понравилось, отель открывается через электронный ключ. Посторонние попасть не могут. А еще его расположение, в стороне от шумной дороги. Но при этом в шаговой доступности от пляжа, кафе, и вин.маркета)

На каждом этаже установлен кулер с чистой водой. Можно брать пляжные полотенца, ребенку даже дали ведерко с лопатами и формочками для пляжа.

Check in/out was easy. We enjoyed the hotel breakfast - from the other reviews, you can put in a request the day before to try local breakfast food in addition to their standard western breakfast offerings. You can have an omelette or fried eggs made to order long with chicken sausage. We tried string hoppers with dal and chickpeas with coconut sambol. The husband and wife duo could not be more friendly and pleasant. They both lead interesting and busy lives, speak english well and their staff (older woman and middle-aged man were always smiling, helpful and eager to make our stay more pleasant).

You leave the hotel key at the front desk when you exit each day (this prevents key loss and access for them to clean your rooms). The bathroom is large and modern. We didn't use the balcony but the rooms have them. Since we stayed during Christmas, you could see fireworks from the balcony on Christmas Eve.

The location is awesome: a 6-7 minute walk to Unawatuna Beach, a 15 minute tuk tuk to Jungle Beach (we didn't prefer this beach because you have to trek down some rocky path 10-15 minutes before you reach the beach). We opted to go to Wijaya Beach (our favorite!). We checked out Hikkaduwa Beach (45 minute car ride) on the day we left. Heaven by O is also a short tuk tuk ride to Galle if you want to check out the fort. Throughout our stay, the owners provided useful tips (tuk tuk pricing) and other suggestions for our itinerary.

By way of background, my wife and I visited Sri Lanka from 7th September to 27th September 2018 to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. This was our first visit to Sri Lanka but will certainly not be our last. We booked the trip independently including travel between the different venues. The accommodation under review was selected following research on this site and other recommendations on various web blogs.

We arrived at this hotel late in the afternoon having travelled from Ella by “taxi” / hired minivan and driver. This was our most costly outlay for transport but the quickest when considering bus etc.
We were welcomed by Bhawantha and Wasantha and shown to our room. The hotel currently has eight rooms and throughout our stay there appeared to be only two other guests staying.

The hotel appears to be managed by Bhawantha, who is responsible for day to day admin and is keen to advise on the local area and attractions to visit. He is assisted by Wasnatha and Kanthi who provide the breakfast and cleaning duties. Breakfast is a simple but adequate selection based on western palates. However, we prefer to try local food and Wasantha and Kanthi were delighted to provide curry and string hoppers during the rest of our stay.

The hotel is ideally located a short distance from the beach. As described by previous reviewers, It’s clean, well maintained and very comfortable and at a good price. i understand there are plans to extend the hotel which will include a swimming pool.

This hotel is a must stay for us. It rightly has top place on this site for places to stay in Unawatuna. 

We found throughout our trip that it was the local people that made our holiday so memorable. In the case of Bhawantha, Wasantha and Kanthi they are lovely people that make you welcome and are eager to ensure you have a good stay. We wish them well and hope to see them in the future.

While in Unawatuna we visited the following Restaurants:

“This is it” (Next to or part of - Samson’s Seafood) – On the beach – late evening - Good rice and curry cooked to order. Enjoyed food – visited twice. Worth a try.

Jinh Vegetarian and Vegan Restaurant – Overrated restaurant – poor food and not worth the money – avoid.

The Roti Shop – Ok for a snack - food was good but not exceptional. Would visit again.

Toddy by Hope. On the beach – Good Coffee served in Cafetieres 

We also visited the Yatagala Raja Maha Viharaya Temple and then Galle using a tuk tuk which cost 400lkr one way.","This is the place you are looking for","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r625694449-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The best part is the people - this is a family run hotel, and one or more of the family members is on hand at all times and the staff are also incredibly polite and helpful. When we checked in we were handed a cold towel and a cold juice drink. Nothing was too much trouble, from our early check-in (10am) to our late check-out (2pm) and everything in between. They are just so gentle and thoughtful. For example we rented a scooter from the place next door (how handy is that?) for a couple of days, and we parked it at the back of the hotel overnight. Well it rained, and someone moved the bike to a spot close to the window under the balcony so it wouldn't get wet. Then they brought us two rain capes to wear while we were out on the bike in case it rained. Just incredibly thoughtful.
Breaktast was wonderful, with the housekeeper Kanti (?spelling) making Sri Lankan dishes like egg hoppers, string hoppers each morning as well as continental options.
The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the beach, cafes, ATMs, restaurants and shops - everything you need is close by. But even better, it is super quiet at night, the walls are thick and you won't hear anything outside your room, either from within the hotel or outside.
Don't go anywhere else in Galle or Unawatuna, this is the place to stay.","You won't find better than this","2018-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d12050251-r581230679-Heaven_By_O-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",
