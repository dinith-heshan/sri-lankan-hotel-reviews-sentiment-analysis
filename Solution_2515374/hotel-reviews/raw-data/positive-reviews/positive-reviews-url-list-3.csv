What a fantastic decision! From the moment I arrived, the team made me feel genuinely welcome. The service was warm, personal, and incredibly professional throughout my stay.

The rooms are stunning – stylish, spacious, and filled with natural light. Everything was spotless, and the attention to detail made it feel like a true luxury retreat. The setting is serene and beautifully maintained, perfect for unwinding.

A real highlight was the cuisine. The chef is world-class, and every meal was a culinary masterpiece. Fresh, flavorful, and artfully presented – honestly on par with top fine dining experiences I’ve had anywhere in the world.

Everything about my stay was flawless. If you’re looking for an intimate, high-end boutique hotel on Sri Lanka’s coast, Kumu Beach is the place. It’s peaceful, elegant, and far exceeded my expectations.

We stayed at the hotel for 5 days, and for that time, it felt like we had been transported to Paradise. I have never experienced such kind and attentive staff, they couldn't do enough for us all. We were all looked after so well, and everyone was so personable and understanding of our requests. The hotel itself is perfect. Our room, an ocean view room, was gorgeous. Clean and comfortable, with a fantastic rainfall shower, the staff were kind enough to turn down our rooms in the evening. Our meals were all amazing. We had the delight of being able to enjoy not only the chef's regular menu, but also the wedding/event fare as well. All dishes, sweet and savoury, were fantastic. It was some of the best seafood that my partner and I had ever tasted. Everything was fresh, very tasty and I wish I could go back for more! 
The poolside was a lovely, calming area, listening to the Indian Ocean on a sun lounger was idyllic, but remember the strong UV! The Sri Lankan sun is no joke. 
With the wedding, the staff were amazing in making sure that everything was in order, and all we had to do was relax and enjoy the day. It couldn't have been more perfect. 
We are counting down the days to our text trip to Kumu Beach, I hope there will be many more.","Heaven on earth","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r1011837187-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our tour in March and had a wonderful, relaxing few days.  We didn't venture out of the hotel so cannot comment on surrounding facilities or attractions.  Hotel is amazing and the attention to detail here is second to none. It benefits from being small and exclusive.  We had upgraded to a superior room and it was well worth it. One of the nicest suites we have ever had on our world travels.  This hotel is a sister to Goat Fell at Nuwara Eliya which we stayed in and was equally fabulous.  We had requested a higher floor but initially we were accommodated on the ground floor.  However next day the staff moved us upstairs which we were delighted with; two balconies with fab views of sea.  (The duty manager who looked after us here was exceptional, I am so sorry I have forgotten his name). Food here is also exceptional with personalised and cheery service from the chef (India?) who will tweak any dish to your liking. My husband said he cooked the best Tiger prawns in the world and he had them every day!!  Complimentary G&Ts at 5pm were a lovely touch and the pool and loungers are perfect for this hotel. A few steps down to the beach and you can walk along in both directions dipping your toes in the sea.  We had the most perfect four days here and were sorry to have to leave.

With only a few rooms, it felt very special. The staff were of course, very attentive and helpful, and we were especially well looked after by Ruchinia.

We stayed three nights and it was absolutely perfection.
Our room - Oceanview Suite was fantastic - silent at night and with plenty of space for our family of four.

We all loved the huge, warm pool and relaxing environment. The beach was incredibly beautiful and the kids loved climbing on the rocks.
At the end of each day, we loved  the makeshift bar on the lawn with complimentary drinks and crisps at 5pm, just in time for sunset. Such a nice way of bringing everyone together.

Another highlight was the BBQ night we had - where the chef prepared a huge variety of delicious food for us (including ensuring we were happy with the menu in advance and adding/changing it to our request).

We stayed at 5 teardrop hotels (they are all fantastic) and did a Teardrop Journey - which I REALLY recommend.
Our journey included many activities. At Kumu Beach we enjoyed great massages, a visit to a local turtle hatchery and a visit to the Southern puppet museum.

These were all carefully curated for families in mind and our kids were incredibly sad to leave.

The food was fantastic, they catered for the vegetarians in our group very well, adapting the menu and offering to cook different meals if wanted. 

In summary, this was one of the best places we have ever been and we would return tomorrow if we could. Book it!","Beautiful beachside stay","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r1003009394-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your thoughtful review! We’re thrilled you loved the tranquility, design, and warm hospitality at Kumu Beach—especially the attentive service. 

It’s great to hear you enjoyed the food, with the beef curry and egg hoppers being highlights. We appreciate your feedback on shade and sunbeds and will take it into account. As for the beach, its untouched beauty does come with a few quirks, and your tip on repellent is a good one!

If you’re after peace, relaxation, and a boutique feel, this is the perfect spot.

The staff were incredibly attentive, friendly, professional, and always on hand without being intrusive. Special mention must go to Richira, our principal hotel butler during the stay. He was an absolute credit to the Teardrop Hotels group—warm, thoughtful, and always anticipating our needs without us having to ask. We stayed at two Teardrop properties during our trip, and the consistently high standard of service makes me highly recommend them as a hotel group. 

The food was fantastic, with plenty of fresh, flavorful options. We highly recommend trying the beef curry, which was sublime. Equally, breakfasts were a highlight, especially the egg hoppers. 

That said, there are a few small points to note. There is limited shade, particularly at lunchtime, and a canopy or shaded area for dining outdoors would be a welcome addition.

Another minor downside was that on some days, there didn’t appear to be enough sunbeds, which led to the inevitable towel reservation behavior. While this isn’t a direct reflection on the hotel, it’s frustrating when guests claim beds early. Given that Kumu Beach only has ten rooms, ensuring there are enough sunbeds and parasols for everyone would help prevent this.

The beach itself is stunning but surprisingly empty. This could be due to the rough sea conditions or the sand flies—something to be aware of. I ended up with 12 bites, so I’d definitely recommend bringing insect repellent if you plan to enjoy the sand.

One final note: we stayed during the monthly full moon (Poya Day), when no alcohol is served at the hotel","A great coastal escape","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r998228161-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

We have travelled widely and the service is exceptional and really the best we have ever experianced,  it is truly what Sri Lankan hospitality should be ! it is lovely to see every member working together as a team and doing their utmost to ensuring that the guests have a truly remarkable stay, my hoppers were a few minutes late and they apologised and gave me extra hoppers ! Absolutely everyone we encountered went out of their way to make our stay special so it is not possible to mention one person in particular.  We stayed in an oceaview room but it was downstairs and the view is  of the swimming pool and you can see the ocean but it is not as great as you would experiance from upstairs which was just breathtaking. The two suites were on the upper floors and it makes sense to stay in those rooms. The room was lovely and the bedding was very comfortable . Food was very good and we felt we were overfed and we were struggling to eat all that we were given. The pool is lovely and given that there are only 10 rooms there was ample space to lounge around with a view of the ocean.  There is cake and coffe at 3pm, Happy hour at 5pm and you can use the drinks in the fridge once a day. However there was no life guard but given that the sea is rough and unpredictable unlike in Bentota , it would be good to have one for those who would like to spend some time in the Ocaen. Beach is very clean and its good to go for walks . Despite being attentive and trying their best to accomodate my diatary needs as I am allergic to dairy and I felt food options were limited, I hope there will be better options for such people in the future.","A slice of Paradise","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r994940835-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

The staff were incredible - super warm and attentive. (I later found out just how helpful they had been with accommodating and organizing the proposal with my partner too). Kumu Beach did not disappoint with their Menu either, personally felt it was the best food we had across our tour of Sri Lanka, I'm still dreaming about the prawn tikka wrap I ate for lunch! The breakfast and dinner were incredible too throughly enjoyed being able to try different dishes during our stay, which served a selection of local Sri Lankan food and western cuisine which were all exquisite. They were also very understanding of my partners coeliac disease and were able to easily make changes to the menu for him. To top all of this, let's talk about its location and landscape: JUST WOW! it was a blessing to be surrounded by its diversity, the sound of waves crashing every morning/throughout the night and birds singing. We stayed in room 5 with an incredible view over the private beach, which felt very remote, there was often only my finance and I on the beach which made it feel extremely private indeed.

Only 10 rooms with excellent service from all the staff who spoke good English but not intrusive. The rooms all have sea views and feel private as at slightly different angles. Ours had a 4 poster bed. The room had a huge bathroom. Also a selection of teas and a proper coffee machine with fresh milk in the fridge. The food is fantastic, starting with a 4 course breakfast, any manner of light snacks for lunch and a good evening selection. The chef came round personally most evenings to check everybody was happy. Outside there is a small lawned area and a lovely infinity pool overlooking the beach. Unfortunately when the tide is coming or going the sea is a bit dangerous to swim in because of the undercurrent, but relatively OK for a good swimmer and at other times. The beach has lovely white sand and there was nobody on it even at height of season, perfect for a morning or evening stroll when the temperature a bit lower. We really appreciated the 5-6 pm cocktail hour watching the sun set and all drinks free. Also afternoon tea is free if requested. There is a spa and the massage I had was excellent. The hotel is an hours drive from Galle which for us was a little far for more sightseeing. There is really no village or town to wander around so it is a bit isolated. The hotel does organise various trips if desired. We felt rested and pampered at this hotel at the end of our holiday.","Fantastic hotel, the best we stayed in over a 3 week touring hol","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r993655313-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

This small boutique hotel has only 10 rooms, we stayed in room 7 with an ocean view. The room was spacious, comfortable, well equipped with a large bathroom, the view from the bed was just fabulous! All of the staff here are so friendly and helpful, as were all of the staff at the Teardrop Hotels that we had the pleasure of staying at, nothing is too much trouble for anyone. The chef, Indika, is a credit to the hotel, he interacts with guests daily and is clearly proud and passionate about the food that is served. One evening he cooked us a Kottu Roti as a special request (off menu) and it was delicious. All of the food including breakfast, lunch and dinner is plentiful, tasty and well presented. The only criticism is that there are sometimes not enough shaded areas for outside eating during breakfast and lunchtime, a few more parasols are required. The hotel is located on a wonderful, almost deserted beach and is close to other restaurants etc should you wish to venture out.  Afternoon tea and cake/cookies are served daily as are complimentary G&T’s, wine, beer etc during social hour which brings guests together in the gardens. This hotel is truly exceptional and if you like small hotels I cannot recommend it enough!","Fantastic Small Boutique Hotel in a Fabulous Location!","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r992784790-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

We stayed in Kumbuk villa, and it was stunning - incredibly spacious, so comfortable and everything so thoughtfully designed (eg two sets of loungers to catch the morning and afternoon sun). I honestly think that sitting on its terrace, looking in to its private garden, early on a sunny morning with the sound of wildlife in your ears is actually paradise.

All of the staff were great - super friendly as well as fantastic at their jobs… the pool attendant who called every morning to clean our pool and bring fresh towels, the guys who cleaned our room, the restaurant staff, the team in the bar (great cocktails Amith, thank you!), everyone basically!

I would say don’t bother paying for the full board upgrade - not because the food isn’t delicious (it is, and so fresh tasting) but because everything on the menu is good value. While we ate every meal at the hotel, we think we would probably have spent less by just paying for what we ate.

Every member of staff (there’s a lot) are so lovely; welcoming and genuinely proud of the hotel and of their island. The food is sublime and is either grown on the plantation or sourced locally. Breakfasts are huge (home made granola with buffalo curd & palm syrup, breads and cakes, jams and marmalades any type of eggs, fruit and even a traditional Sri Lankan curry breakfast). The  3 course dinners are so spectacular my husband is still going on about them. Honestly, don’t bother going off the plantation for dinner anywhere else.

Thank you so much for your heartfelt and detailed review. We are truly honored that you chose our Ayurvedic resort for your very first visit to Sri Lanka and your first Ayurvedic experience. It’s wonderful to hear that your six-night stay was relaxing and fulfilling in so many ways.

We’re delighted that you enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, the treatments, and the warmth of our staff. Your kind words about our therapists and their care mean a lot to us. We believe healing the mind is just as important as healing the body, and we’re so glad you felt that during your stay.

We also appreciate your feedback on the meals. Our kitchen team is happy to know you enjoyed the flavors, and it’s great to hear that you found the personalized service during the off-season to be a pleasant experience. It’s also lovely that you joined our cooking activity and took interest in learning about traditional Sri Lankan cuisine!

We're pleased that even the rainy season added a unique charm to your stay. The way you described being soothed by the sound of the rain perfectly captures the tranquil atmosphere we aim to provide.

It brings us great joy to know that our Japanese language support helped make your solo international travel more comfortable. Your comments will certainly reassure other first-time travelers.

Thank you once again for choosing us. We hope to welcome you back in the future for another healing and memorable stay.

質問やリクエストにもとても温かく笑顔で対応してくださいます。

セラピストさんも、どの方も素晴らしく親切で、技術もとても高いと思います。
毎回、とにかく優しく丁寧にケアをしてくださったので、身体だけでなく心もとても癒されました。
基本的に毎日同じセラピストさんが担当してくださるので、お互いに顔を覚えられて良いです。

食事も、日本人の口に合う、マイルドなスパイスで、美味しかったです。
閑散期のためビュッフェではなくプレートでの提供でしたが、量のリクエストもできますし、ゆったりと食べられて満足でした。
無料のアクティビティで、シェフにスリランカの伝統料理を習いましたが、とても本格的で、勉強になりました。

雨季でしたが、土砂降りの雨が降ってもすぐに上がって晴れ間が出たり、ずっと雨が降っているわけではないので、特に問題ありませんでした。
むしろ、暑さが和らいで、雨音にも癒され、落ち着いて過ごせてよかったと思います。

1人で海外旅行が初めての方や、英語が喋れない方でも安心して滞在できると思います。","素晴らしいアーユルヴェーダリゾート","2025-05","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499080-d10159620-r1009982688-Karunakarala_Ayurveda_Resort-Waikkal_Central_Province.html",

Thank you so much for visiting us again and for taking the time to share your feedback. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed the treatment and that our staff made your stay comfortable and pleasant.

We truly appreciate your comments regarding the meals. We do try to adjust the spice levels to suit a wide range of preferences, especially for our Japanese guests and families with children. However, we understand that some guests may prefer a spicier option, and we take your suggestion seriously.

Please rest assured that we will review the menu and explore ways to offer a slightly spicier alternative for those who would like it. We're grateful for your honest feedback and are always looking for ways to improve.

We would be thrilled to welcome you again in the future. Thank you once again for your support!

This hotel, only 7 rooms was previously a residence and has been turned into the most fabulous hideaway. 
Our room, Cynthia, was on the first floor and was exactly what we wanted. It has traditional decor but with modern amenities. So often in Asia ‘traditional’ means tired - far from it at Maniumpathy, here it felt neat, contemporary and supremely comfortable whilst also being immaculate. The minibar was also free!
The food was excellent and pretty much any tastes can be accommodated. As other reviews state the Thali is a great start. Drinks are reasonably priced and the ambience is perfect. 
Levels of service beat many 5 star hotels and nothing is too much trouble. 
Because it is small and I think offers its services as a restaurant to non residents the tiny restaurant can fill up but this was never problematic to us. Our room was one of the closest to the restaurant and whilst not a problem to us as we sleep well, lighter sleepers might wish to request a different room. 
We would definitely come back!","Calm, peaceful and a wonderful way to start a holiday.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d9702682-r993730189-Maniumpathy-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We wanted an elegant place, preferably isolated and with great food and service.  

The Stafford bungalow delivered all of this and more.  Our guide had a call from the hotel on the morning of our arrival to check details and make sure they were ready for us.   We were warmly welcomed and taken to our lovely room.   Each room has its own private garden as well as the extensive grounds of the hotel.   Very comfortable and had everything we needed.   We were the only guests for one night which made it all very exclusive and special.  Another couple joined us for two nights and was also nice to chat and share experiences with them.  

We had a light snack every day at 3pm.  A savoury bite and a sweet treat.  Plus coffee and tea.  This was perfect for us as we found that the breakfast filled us up and the dinners were good too.   You do have to discuss breakfast options the day before if you want things  like hoppers and they like to get your dinner choice before 4pm.   We enjoyed all our meals with the Sri Lankan curry on our middle night being a real favorite for us both.   

There is nothing immediately around the bungalow.  Just the tea plantation.  There is a village about 2km away but we didn’t leave the bungalow for 3 days other than to do the tea plantation walk with very knowledgeable guide.  
It’s a place to relax, swim, read books and pretend you own the place.   The pool was a great touch with a hot tub that needs 30 mins to heat up.  

We found the service to be great.  Staff were on hand when we needed them but not too intrusive. 

Only improvement suggestion - all of our other hotels have us a small gift on our departure, cookies or tea or some spices.  It would be nice if the bungalow also did this.  

We loved our 3 days here and would happily return when we next visit Sri Lanka.","A very special place.","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r1014138396-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The pool is in an idyllic location looking over the estate and we went on the bird watching walk arranged by the team  which was great as well as a separate tour of the tea plantation.

Don’t miss the local restaurants and pubs that surround the hotel, it’s amazing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the **Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel** in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional, and we were fortunate enough to stay here twice—once when we first landed in Colombo, and later when we had a layover before our flight the following day. Both times, the experience was truly memorable, and this hotel has now become one of our favorites.

Nestled beautifully on the bank of **Beira Lake**, the hotel’s location is perfect, offering a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the city. Surrounded by the modern skyline of high-rise buildings, including other major hotels, the view from this property is simply breathtaking. It is a stunning blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty, and the moment we arrived, we felt the luxurious yet welcoming atmosphere.

The check-in process was impressively smooth and high-tech, handled entirely on an iPad, which was a refreshing experience. Special thanks to the young trainee, **Mr. Dulimina**, and his manager, **Mr. John**, who went above and beyond to offer us a lake-view room. Their hospitality was top-notch, and we were thrilled with our room.

The room itself was spacious and pristine, offering a spectacular view of the **swimming pool**, **Beira Lake**, and the majestic **Lotus Tower**, which can be seen in all its grandeur, especially at night when it lights up in dazzling colors. The nighttime view of the Lotus Tower from our room was simply enchanting, making the entire stay feel magical.

The housekeeping team did a fantastic job, keeping the room spotless throughout our stay. We were especially happy with the attentive service, as we were provided with water bottles whenever we needed them, even late into the evening.

The **breakfast and dinner** experiences were absolutely WOW! The **Sri Lankan cuisine**—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—was superb, and the hotel’s elaborate menu of **Indian, Asian, and Italian** dishes left us spoilt for choice. Every meal was a delightful treat, and we truly enjoyed the variety and the delicious flavors.

One of the best things about this hotel is its **central location**. It’s close to local pubs, restaurants, and popular tourist spots like the **Dutch Museum**, which was one of our favorites to explore. Another highlight for us was the **live music** played at the bar, located right in the lobby. Sipping drinks while enjoying the tunes and overlooking the swimming pool made for the perfect relaxing evening.

During our stay, we also had the pleasure of experiencing some amazing events. One memorable night was the **Saturday dance and fun event** hosted by the hotel. It’s a plush event for outside guests, but for hotel guests, entry is free—though drinks are extra. It was a great way to wind down and enjoy the lively atmosphere. As a bonus, we had the chance to meet members of the **Sri Lanka and Bangladesh women’s cricket teams**, who were staying at the hotel, and we even witnessed a beautiful **Sri Lankan wedding** taking place. These unexpected extras added so much to our experience, making it all the more memorable.

Finally, we have to extend a big thank you to **Joshua**, **Tharushi**, and **Madhushikha** from the restaurant, who welcomed us with such warmth and smiles every time we dined there. Their kindness and service made our stay even more enjoyable.

Overall, our experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was absolutely wonderful, and we will **definitely return** to stay here again. The hotel’s mix of luxurious comfort, superb location, and outstanding hospitality has won us over. We can't wait to come back!","An unforgettable experience at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r971854403-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Before our visit, we contacted the Resort Manager at Ayurvie Weligama and were warmly welcomed by him and the team for lunch and treatment. The Manager and the Housekeeping Supervisor were kind enough to give us a detailed tour of the property – such a beautiful and serene place!

We enjoyed a delicious lunch featuring fish fingers and sweet potato chips, which was absolutely fantastic. Following lunch, we both experienced Ayurvedic treatments. I was treated by a highly experienced senior therapist, while my husband had an excellent male therapist (a gentle giant!). The treatments were incredibly relaxing and unforgettable.

It’s hard to put into words how special the experience was. We returned to Sri Lanka after 13 years from Italy, and this visit has been a highlight of our trip.

We also had the opportunity to connect with Thema Collection’s marketing division, and as owners of a travel and ticketing agency, we are excited to promote Ayurvie Weligama and the Thema Collection to our clients. In fact, my husband has already decided to send his family to stay and enjoy this wonderful experience.

Only 3km from the Weligama railway station and main surf point.  The beach is right opposite of the hotel, just step out from the luxury hotel garden. Very calm place, tasty and healthy food. Friendly staff which support you from the arrival moment till the departure. Yoga master is the best in Sri Lanka.  Ayurveda Drs given not only health consultation and treatment recommendations, they also explain properly what is Ayurveda and how its works and helping in our life. You may come here as solo tourist or couple, just for few days for holidays or for 2weeks treatment. But im guarantee that you'll remember this place for all your life and definitely will recommend to your friends. For solo tourist who coming for few days only i recommend for experience some type of therapy in the hotel. Ive got neck& shoulders and foot massage. OMG i felt in that moment that i born again. 
Please also remember, as Ayurvedic hotel - there no  coffee, black/green tea and alcohol accepted. Herbal tea you may always order from the reception or restaurant. I really liked their nelly herbal tea after the therapy..

Io avevo una camera singola che non era vista mare ma ugualmente bella. Pulizia eccellente e prodotti per il bagno di alta qualità. Attenzione alla cura dei dettagli e all'ospite massima. Il personale è attento ad ogni esigenza e molto gentile, i terapisti e i dottori sono incantevoli. Il terapista è lo stesso per tutta la durata del soggiorno (grazie a Sujeeva) e i trattamenti sono personalizzati in base alla visita ayurvedica iniziale. Siamo stati in gruppo e a tutti è piaciuto anche il cibo sempre molto vario nonostante l'assenza di carne. Chi sceglie questo resort è per un autentico percorso di purificazione ayurvedico, mi sarebbe piaciuto usufruire del percorso completo (panchakarma) ma siamo rimasti pochi giorni, suggerisco almeno 10 notti. Non vengono serviti alcolici ma solo acqua calda ai pasti e tisane prescritte dopo la visita. Alla fine del soggiorno c'è anche un consulto finale molto apprezzato con tanti consigli utili per mantenere lo stile di vita e l'alimentazione equilibrata. Ho apprezzato che non hanno per niente proposto vendita di prodotti naturali che ci hanno fornito durante il soggiorno, al punto che siamo stati noi a richiederne l'acquisto. In genere evito di tornare negli stessi posti ma mi farebbe piacere ripetere l'esperienza in questo resort.

On arrival I was greeted by Dimutha with a smiling face and fruit cocktail followed by a foot massage straight away after a long flight from the UK.
My room was very clean , light and spacious overlooking the infinity pool and the beach. Hearing the waves of the sea every day was like a meditation so straight away I started to feel at one with the energy of Sri Lanka .
My consultation the next day with Dr Isura was to discuss my physical, mental and emotional concerns . He fulfilled all of these things with my programme in a warm, kind and empathic manner and took everything into consideration of my needs .
The treatments were every day for fourteen days with the most wonderful compassionate therapist Sriyani who I connected with straight away . She is a top class therapist who works on a very deep level covering all my concerns  . I can honestly say she is the best therapist I have ever come across and works so hard  as she radiates love and healing from her heart . All the therapists were always smiling as it’s such a happy place to be .
Every day at 6.30am I went to a yoga class with Emil who is a highly qualified teacher . All of his classes and meditation classes were very composed and healing overlooking the stunning views of the bay . I learnt a lot from him about yoga and his breathing techniques.
I also want to mention the wonderful food prepared every day by the chefs and for the waiters for their excellent service as nothing was too much trouble . Also credit to their manager Nipun . There were many choices of food and always varied as my dosha is Vata. The teas are wonderful so I have bought some back home . I didn’t miss coffee after 3 days which I was surprised about and also of course there is no alcohol .
All the staff were excellent so my whole experience has made me feel calm , lighter , brighter and healed . I was the only English person at the hotel but everyone was happy so I just felt the vibe so it didn’t matter as I so needed to detach anyway from the pace of life .

I have bought back some of the Sri Lankan happiness and love and I hope that I can keep in this positive bubble to continue healing in the pace of life that we all live in. 
I will definitely be coming back again to re-balance and recharge and have peace of mind .","Spiritual Journey of healing","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d15344173-r1002891385-Ayurvie_Weligama_Thema_Collection-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

As an Ayurvedic travel agent, I perceived the reactions not only of my group but also of the other guests at the resort. The service is of a very high standard, despite the fact that I was interpreting for several people, everything was very well organised. To begin with the reservations department has an amazing team who go out of their way to help with booking suitable rooms, also to give advice. The manager - Mr. Dimuthu is very helpful and checks every day to make sure the guests are happy. All the staff at Ayurvie are very professional, helpful, one feels really welcome there. The medical team is very thorough, helpful and very empathetic. Every small problem they immediately solve and help really with heart. I have seen how the health problems of the people in my group have improved significantly and they have expressed an interest in coming back again. The therapists are experienced, meticulous and can empathise beautifully with the client, which is very essential. You just mention at reception that you have a problem with something and the remedy happens straight away. 
As I have been involved in nutrition for over 10 years and Ayurvedic nutrition for several years, I follow this part of the Ayurvedic journey very closely. From repeated experience, I see great potential in Dr. Isuru's nutritional recommendations and also all my clients follow these recommendations with enthusiasm. It is nutritionally balanced and sustainable in the long term even in our European conditions. So that is really effective. And most importantly, people have success in losing weight and in improving their health.

From the moment I arrived, the service was outstanding, and the staff were incredibly warm, welcoming, and attentive. They made me feel at ease right away.

The doctor was especially lovely. She took the time to thoroughly understand my needs, tailoring my treatment to target specific areas for improvement. It felt deeply personalized and authentic. I was fortunate to have Sriyani as my therapist throughout my stay. She was not only incredibly kind and sweet but also radiated a positive energy that truly enhanced the entire experience. Having the same therapist for my entire treatment journey added an extra layer of comfort and trust. Sriyani worked closely with the doctor, ensuring that my treatments were continually adjusted to suit my preferences and needs.

The yoga sessions were another highlight. They were not only excellent but also profoundly authentic. I looked forward to each morning’s class, where the teacher dedicated time and care to explain every movement of each asana. I appreciated the attention to detail, as it helped me learn how to perform the asanas correctly to maximize their health benefits.

My only piece of feedback would be that the property could benefit from a refurbishment. Although the location is stunning, with breathtaking views and a prime setting, I felt the rooms didn’t quite match the high standard of service. That said, the exceptional service and overall experience far outweighed this small aspect.

We booked a two night stay at one one of the villas,
And when we checked in it was quick and smooth,we did not have to wait as they quickly took us to our villa and the payments were done at the villa itself which was convenient.
The villa was amazing,had our own mini private pool and the room was quite spacious and I guess the highlight was the bath room with a nice tub in the middle and the shower area with a papaya leaf inspired shower which was quite interesting,
When we checked in we were introduced to THARAKA who was there to assist us at any given time,and he did not disappoint us at all,
We communicated from watsapp and he was always quick to respond and attend to our needs.
From the dinner to breakfast he gave us the option of dining at the villa or the Pappali restaurant at our own convenience.
The food was really good and the portion size was perfect too.only thing I could highlight as a minus was that the carbonara pasta was made with cream which was still tasty but could have done with  cheese and egg yolk.
The main pool was also really nice in the evenings overlooking the sea.
All in all we had an amazing time thanks to THARAKA who was always assisting us and the rest of the staff who were also very friendly.
Thank you and we would definitely come again to have even better experience than this.","One of the Best stays with quiet surroundings,good food and amazing staff.","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499080-d15198149-r1008931723-Wattura_Resort_Spa-Waikkal_Central_Province.html",

The food was above and beyond one’s best expectations and the quantity staggering. The pools were sparkling, cool and calming. The beaches were clean and mesmerizing, with its tranquil shores and beautiful breeze. The kids had a variety of things to do in the game room, and at the kids water playground. We were also able to play some pool.
If there is any suggestions we could make it would be the availability of the transportation at a more nominal price and to ensure all the arcade games are working.

Sehr leckeres und abwechslungsreiches Essen mit viel Obst und Gemüse: traditionelle Küche und westliche Gerichte. Überraschend dass es neben den nach Doshas ausgerichteten Speisen sogar Fisch oder Huhn gibt. 
Jeden Morgen eine Yogastunde, jeden Tag Konsultation mit den Ärztinnen und 2x 90 Minuten Anwendungen jeden Tag!

The whole team went above and beyond to make it the most special time for us - can’t thank them enough! The food was AMAZING, the sunset was the best we’ve ever seen and the private beach made this property an absolute stand out. This is somewhere you could stay for a week or more as the room, location and  food are just perfect to unwind and relax.  The rooms and bathrooms are huge and absolutely stunning, all with amazing views and we had the best sleeps here. 

We were technically here in “off season” and it was still incredible due to the awesome pool that feels like it’s floating above the ocean. The beach is also basically private due to the hotels position and it is so so beautiful. We will certainly be back - I even cried leaving Kumu Beach after having best experience and not wanting to leave.

Our daughter decided to have her destination wedding at the property, which was amazing. The staff made sure the day was memorable with a dash of Sri Lankan culture, which included traditional Sri Lankan dancers and singers, concluding with a delicious Sri Lankan Feast for all the family.
Our Australian family of all ages really enjoyed the property, especially relaxing and swimming in the lovely pool. 
We had a variety of room types and all were well appointed and luxurious.
Breakfast which is included in the tariff was the best we had in Sri Lanka.
The massage was awesome and just what we all needed after travelling. 
Could not fault this property or its staff. 
The staff organised day trips to amazing Galle Fort which is only a short drive away.
We hope to return as it was such a wonderful accommodation. 
It is awesome for groups and families and also works for couples.
Social hour is a fabulous chance to enjoy a GnT with other guests. We enjoyed the company of the other guests that were from all over the world. 
If you prefer a quiet Social Hour there are plenty of locations on the property that you can enjoy a private drink or two. 
Walks on the beach are especially romantic as it is very private with hardly any people on it. 
However, if you are travelling with a group or a large family, and do not wish to rent a villa, this is the perfect location. 
The staff go above and beyond to make sure everyone has an incredible time.","Destination wedding at a beautifully appointed beach front guest house!","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r964198499-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

I spent three perfect nights here (first night with a friend and two solo) during the off season.

A storm hit the coast on the first night and the waves of the Indian Ocean crashed against those beach rocks at Kumu like God's wrath were about to be unleashed. When morning arrived, the staff had already cleared away all evidence of the previous night's inclement weather and I enjoyed a tasty breakfast of egg hoppers and curry on the breezy deck of the hotel.

The setting has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. So postcard-perfect it was surreal: from the swaying coconut trees to the view beyond from the infinity pool.

The staff is unintrusively attentive and happy to please.  They take a stay at Kumu Beach over the top and are key to what was a memorable vacation. 

The menu is extensive. Chef Indika-- how does he manage it? There are so many items to choose from, considering there aren't more than a dozen rooms on site. He and his staff do a stellar job consistently turning out fresh, yummy, and beautifully presented dishes. 

Rooms are well-kept and thoughtfully equipped with attention-to-detail I appreciated (like a beach bag I could use while I was there).

Thank you to Ruchira, Chef Indika, Lahiru, Yugan, Nilanchana, and many others whose names I didn't catch for your hospitality and sharing the spirit of Sri Lanka with me.

Breakfast at KUMU is a far more dazzling experience.

I felt more like a ‘day scholar’ as opposed to the kids in the dorms. I know, it’s a pretty dismal analogy. There wasn’t anything remotely sour like school buildings, dour corridors and institutional food.

Simply the fact that we came for breakfast, felt enchanted, stayed put the whole day till sunset and then left (without seeing the elegant rooms shrouded behind frangipani trees draped around wooden stairways, for we had other commitments in Colombo), made me think of the ‘day scholar’ metaphor. Truly, I was envious of the other guests who had, by the time we were leaving, were ensconced in their deck chairs, clutching onto pastoral coloured, long drinks, serenely absorbed in the near-sunken sun, by the Indian Ocean looming large.

Many, I guess, were paying homage to the tantalising horizon. One couldn’t help feeling a sense of awe, staring into lawns of KUMU from the beach edge, the large expanse of verdant patches of green appearing more immaturely manicured than the quads at Christ Church, Oxford.

Sorry! All this is digression, for we came to KUMU for breakfast. 
Thanks for entertaining us, my three dear friends and I who stayed at a nearby villa, with a paralysingly breathtaking vistas, decided to come here for a splurge, in spite of us being non-house guests of KUMU.
I appreciate KUMU’s  flexibility whereas many a fancy hotel would have turned us away, And disappointed were we not, and truly a splurge it was.

No sooner did we park and were ushered through the short and somewhat uncharacteristic passage than we felt the magic of Phillip Weerarathna’s  (first time I was enjoying the subdued, yet sublimely curated space of a leading architect of the the island) eye for visual guile and trickery. One couldn’t help mesmerised by the massive metallic balls, the sculpture, the architectural motif, raising KUMU’s identity as a unique place; they elevated her from the run-of-the mill Beach Resorts of South Coast.

It was a perfect day. Cloudless skies and mildly rippled waters were in perfect harmony. All elements had a welcoming effect. We sat at the corner, at a table immaculately set, with damask serviettes. 

I must apologise for being a sucker for such little trial details. But I love my short, fat fingers nuzzling thought the thick cotton drapery, whilst waiting, in earnest, for goodies to come. It was late for breakfast, the last order; we were ravenously hungry. 

For a split second, I was wondering if I were Judy Garland impersonator , (my dear queer self identifies myself with her than  with John Peppard:) My senses weren’t inebriated; nor was Balapitiya the New York of the 40s. But I could relate to Holly’s sense of enchantment, at BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S . 
In my case, it was strictly, culinary experience at KUMU’s.

I didn’t have to scour  the menu for long. I ordered, with child like anticipation, one of the Sri Lankan entries, hoppers (pan cake genre with an erect circular crust) and white fish curry, accompanied with two traditional relishes, the yummy option which made my day. My friends too were truly happy their Eggs Benedict. But I must admit,  I felt sorry for them, for not having the same as mine. 

Most house guests were done with their breakfast. Many were defying the scorching sun, their pizza-dough bodies hugging sun beds peppered on the lawn or simply frolicking in the pool. Whereas I lingered, for I have always enjoyed slow food concept, filling the little space of the table, with yet another Amricano, snow- capped with steamed fleck of milk, an elongated macchiato. What bliss could I ask for! 

If KUMU’s setting that morning had the power to arrest us with its natural beauty heightened by its flesh-pampering hospitality, we happily submitted.
After an unnaturally long time at the table, the hostile sun light made us become refugees in one of the two handsome living room spaces. Its shades of blue cushions in the fat sofas made us sink into comfort.

We had to abandon our ambitious plans of going to Galle Fort for lunch. 
And lunch we had, right there. And it too was another lip-smacking experience. 
So we went on, one dish n a drink followed by dessert till we realised we have procrastinated relentlessly! 

Unapologetically I said: ‘we have to remain till that fury-riddled, scarlet splash of rays sink and disappear!’ No disapproval did I encounter from my companion. 
So we stayed yet another good half an hour, way after dusk had enveloped the horizons, and warm white pool lights flooded the the garden.

Since all good things have to come an end, I left, feeling giddy with joy, and told myself: ‘breakfast at KUMU is way better than legendary BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S.

For sure I prefer its array of appa (hoppers) to the much coveted jewellery. 

For me, long breakfast at KUMU was a dazzling stay","Breakfast at KUMU would make you think twice about BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S!","2024-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r944583843-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

The villa is so very private with a large sunny terrace and an infinity pool over looking the tea plantation and jungle.  I spent so much time watching the monkeys in the trees and listening to all the sounds below, especially the peacocks, one of whom popped in to see us most evenings in all his magnificence! 

The whole hotel is so beautifully designed, so tranquil and so efficiently and generously run.  Kadju villa itself felt just like home with it's gorgeous colour, large bathroom and french windows to the terrace.  From the moment we were picked up in Colombo until we were dropped off back at the airport, we were looked after so very well.  Breakfast was superb overlooking the trees in the dining pavilion, something we looked forward to each morning.  Lunch was often brought to our room to eat on the terrace if we hadn't ventured further in a tuktuk to KK Beach, Galle or Koggala Lake.  We enjoyed a cocktail in the living pavilion before a three course dinner each evening, which was superb every night.

Every member of the team were wonderful and we were incredibly well looked after.  It was also lovely to meet the creator and owner of KK, George Cooper who often popped in whilst we had a drink before dinner.  He has truly created a very very special place.  We also enjoyed visiting his shop in Galle which was so well curated and the gorgeous colourful elephant backpack we brought home for our young granddaughter has been exceptionally well received!

In the case of Kahanda Kanda I will make a one time exception.

There are several luxury hotels and resorts in Sri Lanka, but KK stands out for a number of reasons. The staff are incredibly friendly and engaging. Service is excellent. Accommodations are extremely comfortable. The rooms and the entire property are extremely well maintained, which seems to be a rarity in many places. The lounge and open air dining pavilions are comfortable and offer expansive views of the tea plantation and the countryside. The meals are of exceptional quality and very good value. It is quiet. You can go on bike rides down to the KK Beach Hotel. You can get an excellent massage, take yoga sessions in the yoga pavilion, or exercise in the weight room. Or, you can relax by one of the several swimming pools and read a book.

There is also an abundance of wildlife at KK: monkeys, wild peacocks, mongoose, parrots, kingfishers, etc. 

On my most recent visit I rode a bike with hotel staff and visited several temples located in the area. There are several things that make KK memorable, but what stands out is the staff who personify Sri Lankan culture and friendliness.","Luxury Accommodations and Service at Its Best","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r945509593-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Kahanda Kanda is beautifully designed, curated and maintained. Its environment is idyllic. Our Kadju villa was perfect. Its private infinity pool overlooks a jungle ‘amphitheatre’ of constantly appearing wildlife. Every single facility has been considered and is provided to a level of pure luxury.

The food, overseen by Prasad, Bawantha and their teams, is superb: the best Sri Lankan and western breakfasts to order, accompanied by really exotic fruit. Dinners were delicious.

We enjoyed very much our beach day at KK Beach, accessible by the hotel’s own tuk tuk; returned there for dinner; and throughout were made welcome at KK Beach by duty managers Pathum and Manaka, super enthusiastic factotum Kasun and waiter Supun.

The Koggola Lake boat trip, including crocodiles, a serene temple and artisan cinnamon production, was well led by Dinesh - informative, atmospheric and very worthwhile. KK organised for us sunset in Galle Fort (and we recommend for souvenirs going straight to the KK Boutique there) and a transfer to Colombo airport with safe, reliable drivers Sumudu and Sam respectively.

Above all, the KK Collection is made by the extremely friendly, professional and proud level of service provided by its people. George Cooper, the owner, is highly visible and provides real community leadership, if we may say so. We thank all his staff, seen and unseen, front of house and backroom support but, as well as the aforementioned, we commend the following who gave us notable service at Kahanda Kanda: duty managers Sujeewa, another Dinesh and Dushan for their warmth, attention to detail and seamless handovers to each other; barman Konara, waiter Sudeep and trainee waiter Meeru - all with bright futures.

You want to take every room home with you. One piece of advice I would give you is ignore the weather forecast channels as we speak they say it’s raining and I am sitting in glorious sunshine ☀️ writing this review, So if you want a mix of sunshine, some clouds , the odd shower and days spent deciding will I hang out by the pool overlooking Koggala Lake or head to the beach hotel and feel some sand between my toes this is the place to go I cannot recommend it enough.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay, especially our traditional Sri Lankan breakfast and the prompt poolside service. It’s also great to know that our location made it convenient for you to explore the city, beach, and nearby temples.

We appreciate your comments about the security checks on arrival — your safety and peace of mind are our top priorities. These measures are in place to ensure a secure environment for all our guests, especially during large-scale events like the Military Sports Conference.

We're sorry to hear that the pizza didn't meet your expectations, and we’ve shared your feedback with our culinary team to improve on this. Your suggestion is valuable and helps us raise our standards.

We look forward to welcoming you back should your travels bring you to Sri Lanka again.

Up after a few hours sleep and a nice welcome to traditional Sri Lankan buffett breakfast. 
The hotel itself was pretty good, I didn't have any issues. Any poolside service was pretty quick. Need to learn how to make a good pizza, the only letdown.

The photos and videos don't do this place justice - the accommodation is beautifully appointed, spacious and comfortable with a lovely, large conservatory looking out to the garden and pool where we ate our meals. Multiple sitting areas are serviced by wood burning fireplaces and cosy couches, and we've enjoyed afternoon tea in the outdoor pavilion, watching the rain fall over the infinity pool while the fire crackles next to us. The kids love running and playing hide and seek in the gardens and splashing in the heated jacuzzi. We also enjoyed a walk through the tea estate and vegetable farms, guided by Chanuka the head butler, who has been a fantastic host. The food also deserves a special mention - every meal has been delicious. But the highlight really is the incredible service - from hot chocolates on arrival to the daily turn down service (which includes placing hot water bottles into the sheets for extra cosiness!) the staff here really go above and beyond to make your stay special.

The Ayurvedic cuisine, prepared according to traditional principles, was not only authentic but also surprisingly creative and delicious. The cleanliness of both the rooms and common areas met high standards, with regular housekeeping and attention to detail. This stay was the perfect combination of relaxation and health-focused care for me.

Accommodation Experience

Staying at Ayurvie Weligama blends simple charm with functional design. My room was spacious, furnished with wooden furniture and natural materials, reinforcing the Ayurvedic philosophy. The windows opened to a garden full of tropical plants, creating an atmosphere of privacy and tranquility. Every morning, I woke up to the sounds of nature, free from the disturbances of urban life.

The Staff: The Heart of the Hotel

The employees are undoubtedly the greatest asset of this place. The reception team, fluent in English and the local language, was always eager to help with trip planning

Ayurvedic Cuisine: A Culinary Journey

The menu, curated by a chef in Ayurvedic gastronomy, exceeded my expectations. Each of  daily meals (including snacks) was tailored to reflect the guest’s dosha type. 

Cleanliness and Wellness Facilities

The housekeeping team worked discreetly and efficiently. Towels were changed daily, eco-friendly toiletries were replenished, and surfaces were regularly disinfected.  The Ayurvedic medical team also ensured the cleanliness of massage rooms and the preparation of herbs for treatments.

The location is superb - overlooking the ocean and with a lovely little surfers beach less than 20 paces from the back gate. 
It is more a clinic than a hotel, but is neither sterile nor a spa. Expect yoga sessions at sunrise and sunset and 90-120 minutes of pummelling in between.
From the doctors (who are always on hand) to the pool attendant, the genuine care for the guests’ wellbeing was extraordinary. 
The building and bedrooms are modern but the treatment area has been made to feel more traditional and in keeping with the Ayurvedic treatments. 
The other guests were predominantly German, Russian and Dutch. 
The food is good, but tempered for more bland palates so don’t come expecting fiery curries!","Highly recommended","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d15344173-r992538683-Ayurvie_Weligama_Thema_Collection-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

I had a beautifully decorated and comfortable cottage which was a pleasure to stay in and I slept really well. All the cottages are separate from each other and you don't hear anything from anyone else.

The grounds are lovely, so peaceful and very well taken care of. I sat by the river sometimes and was lucky enough to see some beautiful birds and other wildlife.

I had two massages a day given by Madhu who was fantastic, really in tune with what I needed and very experienced. She gave me a massage for my body specifically, not like other massages I have had elsewhere which sometimes are just the ones they give everyone.

We were spoilt by the chef Yohan who cooked up more delicious food than we could possibly ask for at both breakfast and dinner. They were incredibly flexible to our schedule and even managed to accommodate our breakfast despite an early start.

I can’t recommend this hidden gem enough, not only is it a beautiful boutique hotel with incredible hospitality but it’s slightly out of town from the chaos of Kandy whilst being easy enough to get into town when needed.

Vi abbiamo soggiornato due volte nel corso della nostra vacanza in Sri Lanka e siamo rimasti favorevolmente colpiti dalla gentilezza e disponibilità di tutte le persone che lavorano nella struttura.
Sicuramente una validissima alternativa ad alberghi di catena che difficilmente ti fanno sentire la sensazione di stare a casa.

This was however my first time staying at Maniumpathy,  as I typically  stay with family when I'm in Colombo. 

This heritage boutique hotel is everything it's touted to be and more.  I stayed for 4 nights with my dad who is 92 yrs and we had the most peaceful stay with customer service of the highest caliber, second to none. 

We also took this opportunity to host friends and family for dinner on all 4 nights anywhere up to 12 people. The staff who was extremely friendly, yet very professional in every sense, helped us plan these dinners so that my dad & I had a novel experience with each dinner. 

Front desk receptionist Ms. Arjumath, our house keeper Arjana & our butler Sanath Kuruppu deserve special mention. They truly are great ambassadors for Maniumpathy.  I should also mention Shannon & Koshitha, the on site mangement team who worked with me from before our arrival to make our stay extra special and accomadated a few special requests of ours. 

We definitely look forward to staying at Maniumpathy during my future visits back home.","Excellent Heritage Boutique Hotel in heart of Colombo, Sri Lanka","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d9702682-r960435128-Maniumpathy-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Be prepared to be treated with great kindness!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maniumpathy is a lovely hotel and I highly recommend staying here. During breakfast I was trying to think of the best word to describe it - paradise (the earthly and ancient definition) seems most fitting. 

From the moment I arrived, after midnight, I was taken care of like a special guest, or a family member who had recently returned from a long stay away. 

I am thankful to Kuruppu who welcomed me and anticipated my every need and to Upul who took over and helped me learn more about the family and the property. Arjumath was so helpful, answering all of my (many) questions and arranging a tour of the city with a local tuk tuk driver. 

Kositha, the manager, is dedicated to making sure that every guest has the most pleasurable and comfortable experience.  And Isuru helped make sure I felt welcome and cared for. 

I highly recommend a massage!  Highly!!  I have had many great massages but this massage from Rohana was probably the best!!  The deep tissue massage was my selection and worth each of the 90 minutes!!  Afterwards, I sat glowing as I sipped my herbal tea. 

Thank you to everyone.","A delightful place!","2024-07","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d9702682-r959249715-Maniumpathy-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The pool is large and water warm .Nice sunbeds.

The food is wonderful! Compliments to the chef. Lunch was delicious with nice healthy choices as well . Diner is a 3 course menu with Thai influences.
The only criticism is that the portions are too large so shame to waste.Bread is fresh .They use products from their garden.
Breakfast was really nice too .
The large reception/ bar area is very inviting and nice cocktails to be enjoyed.
The gardens are lovely and lots of birds around and monkeys eating all the mangoes !
The staff were lovely and and very attentive in all areas .

The food and the service of the staff were excellent. They had an al-carte menu during our stay and had different varieties for every meal and the meals and dessert were excellent.
Mr. George Cooper who is the owner of the premise visits every guest and make sure that everything is as they expected, which was nice to see.
Hellaconia suite contains a private pool and is ideal for a couple to have a relaxing time. The villa doesn't have a TV however, it has a small library which can keep you occupied during your stay. 
You might be able to see some wildlife during your stay here as well such as Monkeys and Pea Cocks, and if you are a dog lover there are few dogs within the hotel as well whom you can pet.
Even though the hotel is located near several attractions, you can spend the whole stay within the premises without any boredom.

The owner was around when we were at the property and he came one breakfast morning to say hello and check if everything was going on well (thanks for that George). Breakfast was so healthy and filling thanks to all the people involved and Niro for making it even better with the smooth service.

Our room had a lovely balcony but we didn't use it as much because of the nature species(all small wonderful animals) that are endlessly enjoying their space around - we even had a bird that came to say good morning all the time with its colourful beak. 

I'd recommend making sure to carry mosquito repellent and cover the bed with the net before late evening because a few insects still get a chance to penetrate around. Also use the odourless mosquito spray whenever you go out or if you forget tell the duty manager incharge and they will happily assist.

Before travelling we were concerned that following the recent political problems in SL things may be different,  but I am happy to say everything for the tourist is as good as ever. 

We stayed in Kadju this time which was easier for my husband to access but still very private with a beautiful view over the tea plantation.  Spotted many birds and regularly saw the monkey family in a nearby tree. All villas are beautiful,  privately located, spotlessly clean and benefit from the owner's attention to detail. 

KK is ideal for relaxing, as we did, but staff can easily arrange local visits, and a trip to sister Hotel KK Beach is a must, even if just for lunch or dinner, and a good chance to see local life enroute. The early morning outdoor yoga sessions are also a good way to start another lazy day.  All  staff are excellent,  very caring and helpful. 

Food is excellent quality,  with a varied choice from a changing daily dinner menu,  only comment would be the portions are large!  Breakfast equally as good. Both taken on the scenic terrace. Also a good choice of cocktails and wine at reasonable prices.

That said, if you are looking for a nonstop disco or busy nightlife KK is not for you. It is for guests who want to be out of the tourist hubbub and who want to immerse themselves in quiet village life. For those guests who are looking for a balance, you can stay at KK and take a tuk tuk into Galle Fort to experience throngs of fellow tourists shopping in jewelry and trinket shops, and return to KK in the evening.

At KK, you can go for bike rides to the beach and KK sister property KK Beach Hotel. I’ve borrowed a bike and wandered down roads discovering what you’ll never find in Galle. I’ve also walked down the village road and been offered to share a fresh coconut off of a homeowners tree, and then invited to meet the family and given a tour of the farm, including rice fields, fruit trees, farm animals and pets. I’ve also been invited into homes to sit and the be shown lotus flowers, vegetable gardens, and family members. The hospitality and kindness of the Sri Lankans here is incredible - and sincere. That kindness, friendliness and hospitality is indicative of Kahanda Kanda and its staff. I felt like a friend or family member.

The staff at Kahanda Kanda are incredibly friendly. That is not an exageration. They enjoy having to stay there as a guest. There is always a warm smile to greet you. At no time did I feel like an anonymous customer, but always as a friend or a member of an extended family. There is a warmth here you’d be lucky to find elsewhere. There are employees who have worked here for several years, so that tells me about the work environment.

KK is a working and fully functioning tea plantation. As you wander the property or enjoy a meal on the raised terrace overlooking the tea fields below, you’ll see people picking the tea or landscapers tending the gardens. If you have questions about what you see, you can easily engage the staff.

The accommodations at KK are wonderful. The villas are well maintained. The beds extremely comfortable. The outdoor showers, which supplement the indoor bathroom, a real treat. When is the last time you showered outdoors listening to tropical birds, peacocks and monkeys? Almost daily we would watch the monkeys foraging in the trees a short distance from our room, or watch mongooses forage in the yard, or see giant fruit bats at night.

Meals at KK are excellent and will match or beat the quality of many upscale restaurants, and at a reasonable price. There are spa facilities, an exercise room, and the ability to participate in a cooking demonstration by one of the chefs. If you enjoy a relaxing massage, this is your place. If you enjoy a relaxing Sri Lankan or western breakfast or dinner, this is your place. If you want to experience Sri Lankan hospitality, this is your place. If you are open to meeting other guests who share your interest in this sort of experience, this is your place. I have had some wonderful conversations with other guests at KK.

Things to do: 

Bike ride to adjacent villages and KK Beach.
Take a tuk tuk into Galle for a few hours.
Take an early morning boat trip to Lake Koggala.
Walk along the village roads and meet people.
Take day trips to nearby nature preserves.

What you should do:

Donate money or classroom materials to a nearby village school to support needy children and families. This was one of my trip’s highlights, in that I was able to visit a school and see the excitement in student’s eyes. Do it. It is a worthwhile experience you will treasure.
Treat the staff with the respect they deserve and the friendliness they are sharing with you.
Leave a generous gratuity in the tip box.
Ask the staff or Mr. Cooper for suggestions on what to do for activities.","Wow. Simply Wow.","2023-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r882630171-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Everything is been thought off and you can experience that the hotel is created with the wonderful gift of Mr. George Cooper and is cared for with the same energy. It just all fits! The hotel is in such harmony with the surrounding nature, and the villa’s are simply astonishing. We were actually left speechless during our stay in the Kadju pool villa. But take our word for it, we had a tour around the estate, and truly all the villa’s are amazing, so you can’t make a “wrong” choice, it’s another right.
We do want to specifically mention the wonderful staff. Every one of them made our stay even more memorable. They were the sweetest, thoughtful and generous people who attended to all our needs. And next to the above, we enjoyed every meal and drink. The Sri Lankan breakfast is definitely a good choice btw!
We were actually sad to be leaving and we will certainly return!
Thank you Kahanda Kanda for making our honeymoon even more memorable.","Unforgettable experience!","2023-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r880778694-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

As it turned out it was an excellent choice as my wife arrived with a severe bout of food poisoning from a previous hotel and this was the perfect place to recuperate.  The staff are extremely friendly and very considerate to my wife who was mortified at being so ill. 

The hotel is owned and created by an English interior designer, its villas are set among the working tea plantations are gorgeous; beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  The pool area and restaurant also have amazing views over the valley.

We were in Kumbuk, a plantation pool villa set in its own walled garden, it was spacious, private with its own large plunge pool and a place we could have happily stayed for a lot longer. 

In the restaurant the food is of a high standard, the chef has recently been sent to Thailand for a course on Thai cooking and this is reflected in the menu.  The menu changes daily and if there no Sri Lankan dishes on a particular day they can be ordered by request in advance.

The hotel is a 30 minute drive from Galle and we did visit the city on one day but really this hotel is a place to relax in.

As a final point, compared to some of the hotels on this trip Kahanda Kanda represented incredible value for money.","The perfect last stop","2023-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r877275889-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review of your stay with us. Yes, sadly the weather was not great - it has been exceptionally wet of late, but hopefully the tide has turned and we are now getting some sunnier times!

We do tend to offer a slightly limited menu since we like to provide only fresh ingredients and with business being rather erratic these days, it is difficult to have an expansive offering. However I hope you enjoyed the food we did provide.

Thank you for coming to stay, and we hope to see you again - in sunnier days!

Speaking of the villa it has been constructed beautifully.. consisting of the main feature that is the massive private pool and two separate bath areas with a jacuzzi & tub.

We requested the pool to be cleaned as it had fallen leaves due to rain and the staff was super fast in doing so.

would be far more beneficial to write once the political situation was more 
settled and people had more confidence to travel to this beautiful island.
I now feel the time is right.

Kahanda Kanda is a truly beautiful and unique property bursting with George's
style and attention to detail.

George as you probably already know is the amazingly charming owner who directs the whole operation with real flair and aplomb.  A true English Gent.

The staff are excellently trained and are so willing to carry out all of you wishes.
The individual villas all different have a wonderful aura to them - attention to 
detail for all of the facilities is outstanding.

Food is excellent be it on the set daily menu or the ala carte and it is most pleasant
to have a pre dinner aperitif in the lounge area or indeed after dinner - the view is
stunning.

Should you wish to wander the estate there is always a member of staff wishing to
offer their knowledge and affection for Kahanda Kanda - a true learning experience.

If you just wish to relax by the pool (or indeed your own private one if that type of
villa is your wish) it is most pleasant to while away the hours with the lovely view 
whilst watching the wildlife that visit the pool area.  Alternatively, there are a wide
choice of alternative activities from boating to cycling - tea and cinnamon plantation visits or a tuk tuk to Galle.  The ride is exciting as it is enjoyable and well
worth doing to experience a smattering of village life on the journey.

I really do hope that now that the political situation has calmed that Sri Lanka will
once again thrive and that Kahanda Kanda - George and his team of excellent staff thrive with it.  They most certainly deserve to.

If you require a small, quiet relaxing place to stay to recharge your batteries before either returning home or commencing a busy tour Kahanda Kanda would be an excellent choice - highly recommended.","AN OASIS OF TRANQUILITY ON A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND","2022-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r861426932-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Our honeymoon room was really pleasant and clean with a nice balcony and a beautiful view. It was just perfect. I would like to take this opportunity to convey a special thank to Mr. Sachith who is the newly appointed sales manager of banquet halls, for his unwavering support. He was a very friendly guy and also very responsible. It was so easy to contact him for all the requirements regarding the event even at the last minute. We felt his support that much because in the very beginning we had to work with the former sales manager, a young lady, and it was a bit difficult to contact her and communicate with her. But this guy is totally opposite of her and he did his job to the fullest.  We really appreciate your efforts Mr. Sachith.

We had arrived here after about 10 days in the hill country, and so we had to acclimatise to the increased temperature, but it was lovely to have meals served on the verandah overlooking the ocean.  There is little to do in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, although walks to nearby villages are interesting. However, the hotel is just off the Galle Road, with a constant stream of buses to all locations up and down the coast, including Galle, Ambalangoda and Bentota.  This makes it easy to explore other parts of the coast.  A particularly enjoyable trip, arranged by the hotel, was to Lunuganga, the weekend retreat of the late architect Geoffrey Bawa, who designed the house (now a hotel in the same group as Kumu Beach) and the extensive gardens.  We mainly ate Sri Lankan food, which was excellent, and the chef was very willing to meet requests for off-menu items, such as prawns and calamari.

They were incredibly kind and accommodating, assuring us not to worry and placing the booking on our behalf . Upon leaving Glenross Living, Kalutara property, we arrived at Kumu Beach around 7:15 pm. The staff was ready for us, promptly taking our bags and offering beverages while assuring our safety and comfort.

What followed was an overwhelming display of hospitality. Upon entering our rooms, we found the air conditioning already on, accompanied by a handwritten welcome note. They inquired about our dinner preferences, and after placing our order, we freshened up for a much-needed meal. Remarkably, one waiter named Ruchira noticed my strained voice and promptly brought honey and ginger, suggesting their consumption and even arranging a soothing jug of hot water with crushed ginger—a perfect antidote to the challenges faced earlier at Glenross Living, Kalutara.

We stayed for two nights, experiencing the best of everything—from delectable food to exceptional service. Prabath warmly welcomed us each morning at breakfast, ensuring our well-being and promising a memorable holiday. The care extended by Prabath and the team was outstanding, making us feel truly valued. The rooms were immaculate, the bathrooms spotless, and the food spectacular and spicy for us Sri Lankan food lovers. The standout moments were the exceptional hospitality provided by Prabath and Ruchindra. Our entire stay at Kumu Beach was nothing short of amazing, and we were grateful for the warm and welcoming atmosphere created by everyone at the establishment.","Embraced by warmth and exceptional hospitality at Kumu Beach after a challenging day.","2023-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r932001008-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

The location of the hotel is very quiet but has views of a beautiful beach and the infinity pool overlooks it. Worth nothing that the sea can be rough so you can't always swim in it. We also had some of the best sunsets I've ever seen here.

The service was faultless and staff very friendly. The food is of a really high standard with a nice mix of Sri Lankan and Western dishes. If you stayed more than 4 nights the menu might get a bit samey as it isn't huge. On our last night the team organised a romantic private dining experience which was lovely and the chef made us a delicious dinner that wasn't on the menu.

We had an ocean view room on the ground floor which had the most incredible bathroom and a private patio that looked out onto the beach. Ocean view rooms on the first floor don't get the special bathrooms so request a ground floor!

It is 2 hours from Colombo airport so ideal if you don't want a really long transfer on the day you fly home.

Overall I loved my time here and it allowed my boyfriend and I to properly relax before flying home after a busy itinerary.","Kumu beach is a lovely property to relax at after a busy tour.

Huge pool over looking the sea (couldn’t swim in the sea on our visit, too rough). 

Catered well for kids with food etc and the children’s water park (whilst small) was a massive plus and our little boy loved it. Turned the water park on when we asked and pretty much had it to ourselves for 2 days. 

Food in restaurant very good- a bit too much bread and portions large but maybe that is just us. Good wine and drinks list- all reasonable.

Made use of the spa, 2 massages both excellent.

The treatments were wonderful and the treatment centre is really beautiful, calm and very well organised. Both my Dr and therapist were caring and excellent. I left feeling well and relaxed. The food is mostly good - especially the salads, soups and desserts.

It was very quiet during my stay and I was lucky there were some other friendly guests. Nearly all their guests are  from Europe and they cater very much for that market (especially German). I booked directly with the hotel but other guests booked through travel agents and got a much better deal. If you’re considering Ayurvie you may be better off splitting your time into a week here and a week at their property in Sigiriya. 

My room (205) was lovely (with extremely comfortable bed, very good linen and towels) and housekeeping was outstanding. Yoga with Emil was very good.

Room for improvement 
- need to have a better orientation. I felt a bit ‘lost’ when I arrived and there was no outline of how the program would work and what to do, where to go, ordering juices/teas etc. It was a case of figuring it out as I went. I booked for the requisite  14 days but really it could’ve been12 days. 
- the pool area is very worn and needs to be repaired - is bordering on dangerous. Lacking in shade. (I would have loved a tranquil garden to relax in!)","Great treatments","2024-09","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d15344173-r972611739-Ayurvie_Weligama_Thema_Collection-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Bereits im letzten Jahr war ich von der Kompetenz der Ärzte und Therapeuten sowie dem unfassbar lieben Personal so begeistert, dass klar war, ich würde wiederkommen.
Mein Mann hatte als Folge einer Coronainfektion einen Burnout erlitten und wir hatten große Hoffnungen, dass das Ärzteteam um Dr. Herath Hilfe leisten kann. Und es hat funktioniert: Er hat seine volle Leistungsfähigkeit wieder zurückgewonnen.

Alle Mitarbeiter waren hochmotiviert und sehr lieb und besorgt. Es beginnt mit den Rezeptionisten, geht über die Kellner und den Roomservice bis hin zur Hotelleitung.

Die Anwendungen sind sehr professionell und die Ausstattungen des Hotels sind ausgesprochen schön. Bemerkenswert sind die hellen Zimmer mit den schönen Balkonen. Wir hatten in diesem Jahr die große Suite, die keine Wünsche offengelassen hat.

Zum Erfolg der Kur tragen auch die vielen kleinen Zusatzleistungen bei, die wir in anderen Resorts so nicht erlebt haben:
Der Kräutertee wird jederzeit frisch aufgebrüht. Den ganzen Tag über gibt es verschiedene frisch gepresste Obstsäfte nach Wunsch. Wer zwischen den Mahlzeiten Hunger verspürt, erhält eine Obstplatte, die nach dem eigenen Geschmack zusammengestellt werden kann (natürlich unter Beachtung der ärztlichen Behandlungsvorgaben).

Wie bereits im letzten Jahr habe ich das leckere Essen von Chefkoch Kamal Nilanda sehr genossen. Als es meinem Mann anfangs nicht gut ging, bekam er eine ""Wunschdiät""; ein Service, mit dem wir nie gerechnet hätten.

Auch der höchst kompetente Yogalehrer Emil hat die Kur mit den zweimal täglich stattfindenen Yogastunden unterstützt. Noch nie zuvor haben wir einen Yogalehrer erlebt, der die Wirkung der Übungen und deren korrekte Ausführung mit einem solchen Wissen und gut nachvollziehbaren Erklärungen begleiten konnte. Emil ist wirklich einzigartig!

Das Ärzteteam wird von Dr. Herath geleitet, den wir bereits 2011 in einem anderen Ressort kennen- und schätzen gelernt haben und der - zu Recht - als einer der besten Ayurvedaärzte auf Sri Lanka gilt. Aber auch die jüngeren Ärzte strahlen Kompetenz und Sicherheit aus und haben uns voll überzeugt.

Die Therapeuten sind nicht nur lieb, motiviert und engagiert, sondern auch sehr kompetent und konzentriert bei den Massagen. Wenn kleinere zusätzliche ""Wehwehchen"" auftraten, wurden diese sofort in Absprache mit den Ärzten mitbehandelt.

Für uns ist definitiv klar, auch die nächste Ayurvedakur wird wieder im Ayurvie Weligama stattfinden. Wir freuen uns schon auf das Wiedersehen.","Mit hohen Erwartungen gekommen und diese wurden noch deutlich übertroffen !","2024-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d15344173-r962376004-Ayurvie_Weligama_Thema_Collection-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Het is een prachtig onderhouden 'oude' bungalow uit 1884 op een geweldige plek.  De inrichting is adembenemend, veel authentieke details, prachtig meubilair, veel mogelijkheden in het huis om  lekker te loungen. Elke zitkamer heeft een open haard die ook elke dag wordt aangestoken. 
Prachtige tuinen, mooi zwembad, jacuzzi en een loungeplek met openhaard. 
Oorspronkelijk beschikte de accommodatie over 4 plekken. Recent is er een stuk aangebouwd waardoor er twee fantastische kamers bij zijn gekomen evenals een mooie eet-/relaxruimte. Complimenten voor de architect hoe hij/zij oud en nieuw heeft weten te combineren. 
Wij hadden een van die twee nieuwe kamers. Prachtig, ruim, eigen tuin met zitje. Prettige badkamer. Ook een zitgedeelte in de kamer. Turnoverservice. Aan alles is gedacht, zelfs aan een kruik!
Vanaf de grote grasvelden waarop het 's morgens goed ontbijten is heb je een fantastisch uitzicht over de theeplantages.
Het eten - van ontbijt, lunch, afternoon-tea en diner - was geweldig. Elke dag kwam de chef langs om met je te overleggen wat hij voor je kon bereiden. Alle groentes en kruiden vers uit eigen tuin. Elke maaltijd was een feestje.
Voeg daarbij de enorm attente, vriendelijke staff en je begrijpt dat we ons twee dagen in de wolken voelden. 
En dan ook nog een prachtige ochtendwandeling in het gebied rondom de bungalow onder leiding van de manager van de theeplantage. Een belevenis. 
Kortom: meer dan 5 sterren. Dank jullie wel StaffordStaff!","Meer dan 5 sterren","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r941997899-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Not only is it located in a great locality of Colombo, it offers so much inside the hotel that it will be quite difficult for you to leave and go explore the city! I absolutely loved everything here from the interiors, laidback vibe and friendly staff! I’d like to make a special mention for the entire staff as they were all so friendly and upbeat throughout the day and their energy really transfers onto the guests! Upul really looked after me during my time at Maniumpathy and he was just so attentive and friendly and patient! Very accommodating staff as well as polite. They have 7 rooms available which are each differently furnished and I really didn’t expect the level of luxury that I saw in each room! Super beautiful and aesthetic corners dotted around the property as well as some active squirrels which you can spot! The bathrooms were regal and the entire feel of the rooms can instantly relax you and put you in a vacation mood! If you’re coming from the Middle East or in a group/with family, this is a great place to base yourself out of since it’s a locally owned property and they can offer you a true Sri Lankan experience through their hospitality, food and entertainment! I tried so many items from their menu as well and thoroughly enjoyed everything! It was my first time trying Sri Lankan food and the Thaali they served me (A platter consisting of different dishes in small quantities which allow you to eat several things at once) just blew me away and I can really see how different it is to regional cuisines of South Asia while still bearing a few similarities. The Jaffna curry and the Payasam was my favourite! Their pool area is so serene and you can even enjoy at their spa! I think it’s wonderful to stay at several hotels whenever visiting a new country or city as you can check out the area as well and learn more through the locals so a visit to Maniumpathy is definitely a must for the ultimate Sri Lankan experience!","A true example of Sri Lankan opulence and comfort in the heart of Colombo!

This beachside hotel featured an extensive pool area (50 m pool for serious swimmers) and smaller pools for children. The hotel's grounds are quite large, allowing guests to find private spots if desired. The hotel grounds give access to a sandy beach but sea swimming is not the main theme due to surf and currents.
The rooms are spacious and well-equipped with comfortable beds and pillows. We chose the bed and breakfast option but noted there are not many dining options nearby without taking a taxi. A Tuk Tuk ride to Galle, approximately 15 km away, costs about £8 each way, with drivers willing to wait a couple of hours for you in the price.
Breakfast at the hotel offers a wide variety, including pastries, fresh fruit, smoothies, cooked breakfast options, and continental bread basket selections. Many might find a midday meal unnecessary after a substantial breakfast.
The main menu is extensive, featuring Sri Lankan curries, prawn and fish options, as well as chicken, lamb, and vegetarian dishes. There are also burger, chicken  and fish and chips options for those who prefer less spicy food. Most main courses are priced around $15 USD, with starters ranging from $5 to $15 USD. We found a main course sufficient though. however a couple of glasses of wine and beer can double the price of a meal.
The staff were consistently excellent throughout the hotel. While service in the restaurant occasionally suffered when busy, this appeared to be a management or training issue rather than a reflection on the staff, who were always responsive and helpful.
Overall, the country is very welcoming, with friendly locals who value tourism. The accommodation, food quality, and service were all commendable.

Only constructive feedback I would give the hotel is to up their food quality a bit and perhaps explain their guests about how breakfast works a bit better - we were so confused. Also, I had a message, which was nice - but the price of 18.500 LKR is obscenely expensive for what you actually get (there is not even a consultation before to meet expectations of the message, which I would expect for that much money)

Thank you for sharing such a detailed and kind review.

It’s great to know that you had a peaceful and relaxing experience, and we are pleased that our team, specially Nuwan, could make your stay even more special. We are also thrilled that you were able to witness the baby turtles hatching,  it’s truly one of the unique and heartwarming features of our property.

We appreciate your feedback on the local tuk-tuk drivers, and we understand how frustrating it can be when pricing is not clear. We'll certainly look into this issue to ensure a smoother experience for our future guests. In the meantime, we are glad you were able to use the Pick Me app for more transparent pricing.

It was a pleasure having you stay with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back for another relaxing getaway in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Road, Koggala 80000 Sri Lanka","Koggala","Sri Lanka","80000",,"Matara Road",,"601108","5.966639","Koggala, Galle District, Southern Province","80.35703","The Fortress Resort & Spa","2268","4.7","16","29","99","375","1749","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1189030-d601108-Reviews-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.fortressresortandspa.com","2025-03-29","OTHER","5",,"Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Wonderful hotel set in old buildings, we loved our 8 night stay there.   
Breakfast was exceptional with endless options and our Ocean view room was beautiful, so spacious with stunning views of the pool, beach and sunsets.

All the staff are wonderful with very good training and always smiling.  Particular thanks to Nuwan the pool guy and we loved seeing the baby turtles which are hatching in an area to the side of the pool, such a great initiative by the hotel.  

The beach by the hotel is lovely for walking, very empty and under developed so you can walk for miles.   Mostly the sea is too rough for swimming but there is a little lagoon by the hotel for a dip at low tide.

We did many trips out from the hotel to Galle for cricket & history tour and Aghangama where there are lovely bars & restaurants. 

Only slight issue is the tuk tuk drivers who run like a mafia opposite the hotel, constantly trying to over charge which gets annoying & tiring every time you go out.   
If you check the Pick Me app which is the Uber for transport in Sri Lanka you can see the true price you should be paying but the Pick Me drivers were not  able to come near the hotel!

Our favourite  places in Ahangama were Kai, Hotel de Uncles & Ceylon Sliders for more modern food & cocktails and watching the surfers at sunset.   1000 LKR each way is generous for the 10 min tuk tuk ride.  It’s a lovely local town.

Best beach for swimming & snorkelling is Wijaya, often turtles there but you need to go early and leave by 10am as it gets far too busy.  Beautiful for an hour first thing.","Beautiful Hotel with brilliant service, stunning views and peaceful","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r1000262045-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The staff are amazing, very hospitable and always welcoming and friendly. We travelled from Australia and stayed two nights in the Beach room (courtesy of a generous double upgrade) which was an awesome luxurious beach front room, very spacious and clean with all the facilities you need. 

We had our Wedding Ceremony at the Fortress and there is simply no words to describe the wonderful experience we had. Every aspect of our wedding ceremony was professionally and meticulously arranged by the staff at the Fortress. From organising the necessary marriage documents to the floral arrangements, wedding bouquets and bower, decorations, cake, celebrant, music, photography, special celebratory dinner, and the list goes on., we couldn’t have been happier with all of these things and the very best service we received at the Fortress. 

A special mention to our wedding coordinator ‘GAYANI’ who went above and beyond to make sure that our wedding ceremony was successful and memorable. Her attention to detail and dedication to make sure we were happy with all the arrangements is something we will always remember and be grateful for. 

From the time we arrived until we checked out the service was exceptional. All the staff never fail to smile and greet us. The food was delicious & the atmosphere was refreshing.

The food at the White restaurant was superb, we would end up having a 3 course breakfast and ate dinner at the hotel every evening. Mr Sam was always around to answer and questions on the menu and the service staff were great.
There are plenty of sun loungers, even when coming back to the hotel in the afternoon and the pool is stunning. Turtles can be seen just off the beach and Laksiri and all the pool guys are really good.
The little tuk tuk stand opposite was handy and the staff on the hotel gate were super helpful by always agreeing the price for us with the drivers in advance.

Our secret destination elopement wedding took two years to plan, but it only took a few moments to realise that, after touring Sri Lanka for a week, we wanted to not only relax at the Fortress for 5 days, but also to get married here as well. 

The good reviews are all you need to read. From the moment we arrived everyone knew who we were and we were treated like the king & queen of the hotel for the duration of our stay.

Our Wedding Planner Gayani was there to meet us and give us a grand tour of the hotel. Our room was ready on arrival – a complimentary upgrade to a ground floor plunge pool room (WOW!) which opened up directly on to the amazing garden area with the pool & beach just several meters away. Once we were settled we met up with Gayani once again to plan our wedding day which turned out to be extremely straightforward – mainly because, once we’d chosen flowers, locations, timings, etc. Gayani simply wouldn’t let us lift a finger and she arranged absolutely everything!

After a busy week touring Sri Lanka it was finally time to relax. The pool area is stunning, the gardens are exceptionally well maintained, the beach is glorious (right hand side you can walk for miles, left hand side is a safe swimming area), the whole hotel is spotlessly clean, the bar is relaxing, the comfy sunbeds moved to where ever you’d like them, the service is quick, professional and super-friendly… I could go on and on! Every single member of staff had a smile on their face.

We were all inclusive and to our surprise some evenings in White were buffet and some a la carte, there was also a seafood BBQ buffet. We didn’t see the point of eating at the Salty Snapper but we did eat at Duo on our wedding night which was one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Some reviews said it was a little pricey but as it was our wedding night we decided to treat ourselves.  The restaurant staff were all amazing and the food the best we had in all of our trip, so much variety and everything so tasty. We ate so much at breakfast we didn’t need lunch and in the evenings we still struggled to fit in more food. 

We had planned to go outside of the hotel and explore but we were so comfy, happy and relaxed after our week touring that we decided to just enjoy the hotel, the weather, the turtles swimming just off shore, the lizards and crabs running about, and the bats flying around at night. Oh and there was a massive grass snake on day 1, plus some noisy crows. 

We did have to venture to the local Registry Office to apply for our wedding licence. Again, Gayani arranged all of this for us. Her driver picked us up and Gayani met us there… on her day off.  This was quite an exciting & interesting part of the experience of getting married overseas.

Our wedding day involved a lovely breakfast and a couples massage in the spa. My wife-to-be said it was one of the best massages she’s ever had. I’ll be honest I think the wedding nerves were kicking in and I struggled to relax. My partner was then treated to two hours of hair & make-up whilst I was given a spare room to relax & get ready in. Some of the minibar may have been consumed to calm the nerves. At a very reasonable extra cost we paid for dancers & drummers who collected me at reception and paraded me through the hotel and on to the beach.  It was then my partners turn.  The sun was shining, it was just about bearable in the heat, the whole hotel had a wedding show just for them and everything was simply amazing. Maybe we should have googled Sri Lankan weddings a bit more before the day, but I think the surprise of everything made it 10x betting, especially when two young girls appeared out of nowhere and started singing – we both had to hold back some tears. After the ceremony on the beach we signed the wedding certificates, shared out some cake and popped some champagne. We headed to the bar and then to the Duo restaurant which was the perfect end to an unforgettable day! 

Thank you, especially to Gayani, for the wedding of a lifetime. Not only would I highly recommend staying at the Fortress Resort & Spa but I would highly recommend getting married here as well.","Thank you for the wedding of a lifetime.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r996760729-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you ever so much for sharing such a heartfelt and beautifully detailed review of your recent stay with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala.

I’m incredibly proud to work alongside such dedicated individuals whose passion and sincerity create unforgettable guest experiences.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala!

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed and thoughtful feedback about your recent stay with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala. We’re truly delighted to know you enjoyed the unique setting of our resort, nestled between the wilderness of Yala National Park, the serene lake, and the dramatic Indian Ocean.

It's heartening to hear you appreciated the natural beauty surrounding us—from the visiting wildlife near the lake to the powerful waves along the untouched coastline. As you rightly mentioned, while the sea here isn’t suitable for swimming, the beach walks and views offer a raw and calming experience that’s very much in harmony with our theme of being ""in the wild, yet in comfort.""

I’m also glad to know that the safari allowed you to witness some of Sri Lanka’s most iconic animals. While we understand the comparison with African safaris, we hope the intimacy and diversity of our local experiences—paired with the comfort and care of Cinnamon hospitality—provided you with a memorable adventure in its own right.

Your kind words about our bungalows, rooftop bar, and breakfast variety are much appreciated. I’ll also personally convey your compliments to Danushka—he will be thrilled to know that his service and effort to engage with you in German added warmth to your stay.

We do acknowledge your comment regarding pricing, and we thank you for the honest feedback. Our culinary team works hard to source quality ingredients and offer diverse menus, and we continuously evaluate how to best align value with guest expectations.

Thank you again for choosing Cinnamon Wild Yala. It was our pleasure to have you, and we hope to welcome you back for another authentic experience in the wild.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan

Warmest greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala!

I was truly moved reading your beautifully detailed review—thank you for taking the time to share your experience in such depth and sincerity. It’s always a privilege to host well-traveled guests like yourself, and to know we stood out among your global journeys means the world to us.

You captured the essence of Cinnamon Wild in a way few do—the balance between comfort and wilderness, the sound of the ocean threading through the trees, the quiet adventure of moving through our property at night. We put our hearts into curating this blend of nature, peace, and responsible luxury, and your words reaffirm that effort in the most meaningful way.

I’m especially grateful for your kind words about our team, and most notably, about Saman. He is, indeed, a remarkable part of our Cinnamon Wild family. Your recognition of his heartfelt service, generosity of spirit, and thoughtful gestures—like arranging that candlelit dinner—will mean a great deal to him. I will personally ensure your praise is shared with him and with our team, who take great pride in creating memorable stays.

Your safari feedback was equally heartening. We deeply believe that wildlife experiences should be approached with reverence and insight—not just as a checklist—and our naturalists and drivers are passionate about showcasing Yala in exactly that way. I’m thrilled you had such a powerful, intimate moment with the young leopard—what a privilege.

Please know that you will always have a home here with us. Should your travels bring you back to Sri Lanka, we’d be honoured to welcome you once again—to reconnect with nature, unwind in wild luxury, and be embraced by the same warmth that made this stay special.

Until then, from all of us—thank you, truly. And yes, we agree: Cinnamon Wild is incredibly lucky to have people like Saman.

With warm regards and heartfelt appreciation,

Lashanthan Gopalan

Tucked on the edge of Yala National Park, it offers a truly immersive nature lodge experience with an unmatched combination of comfort, adventure, and deeply heartfelt hospitality.

The grounds are stunning. I stayed in one of the beachside huts, slightly elevated with the ocean just visible through the lush foliage. Even when you can’t see it clearly, you can hear the waves—soothing and constant. Walking through the property at any time of day or night feels like part of the adventure: peaceful, a little wild, and deeply restorative. The rooms are lovely, spotlessly clean, with powerful air conditioning (a must in the Sri Lankan heat), and the overall environment is carefully maintained without ever feeling sterile. The entire property radiates a respect for nature and quiet luxury.

But the heart of Cinnamon Wild is its people. Every member of the team—from the staff helping guests move safely at night to the restaurant crew and naturalists—was professional, kind, and incredibly competent. I was traveling solo, and never once felt out of place, uncomfortable, or overlooked. Quite the opposite.

One man, in particular, made an unforgettable impression: Saman, who works in the restaurant and bar area near the lobby (not the rooftop). Saman is a gem of a human being—warm, genuine, and generous in a way that can’t be taught. He spoke to me about his children and his life with such honesty and kindness, making me feel completely at home without ever crossing a boundary. It’s rare to find someone so naturally gifted in service and connection. One night, he arranged a private, candlelit dinner for me by the pool—even suggesting I invite my delayed friends—and when I dined alone instead, he made sure I felt relaxed, welcome, and totally cared for. It’s hard to express how much that meant. Cinnamon Wild is incredibly lucky to have him. He embodies what true hospitality is meant to be.

As for the safari experience—this is the real reason to come to Yala, and booking through Cinnamon Wild is absolutely worth it. I paid $200 USD and felt it was a bargain. My experience was private—just me, an expert naturalist, and an incredibly skilled driver, both arranged through the lodge. Their knowledge of the park and its rhythms was astounding. Thanks to them, I had a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with a young female leopard—less than two years old, not yet named. She emerged gracefully and stayed near our vehicle long enough that we shared a real moment. I saw every kind of wildlife I could have hoped for. My friends, who booked outside the hotel for a cheaper rate, were deeply disappointed by comparison.

The Cinnamon Wild safari team doesn’t just “do the drive”—they read the land. Their guide knew exactly where to go, and the driver was not only skilled on Yala’s notoriously rough roads (I was totally comfortable the entire ride), but also respectful of the animals and other guests. This wasn’t tourism—it was reverence.

In short, Cinnamon Wild is a place I would return to in a heartbeat—and send my family and closest friends to without hesitation. It’s rare to find a property that combines this level of natural beauty, comfort, and truly exceptional human care. If you’re considering Yala, don’t think twice. Book Cinnamon Wild—and if you’re lucky, Saman will be there to greet you.","Glowing Review: Cinnamon Wild, YALA — A Once-in-a-Lifetime Safari Retreat","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r1015654034-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The welcome drink made served there is the best drink I ever had. It was made of tamarind. I asked for more and the staff was really generous to offer another glass for me. 
All in the reception were really friendly and receptive to our ideas. The restaurant staff were very hospitable and they did their fullest to make our stay extremely enjoyable with their mouth-watering food items.  The excellence in the cuisine of the hotel should be noted and our thanks should go to the waiters for their patience with us as they all responded positively to our requests always with a smile on their faces.. the culinary experts at the kitchen should be given a special mention here..

The rooms were spacious and luxurious. Equipped with all A-Z amenities. Bathroom was fabulous. We stayed river front suits. 

They serve ala-carte at the restaurant. The portiins were considerably larger. Tastes is awesome. The restaurant staff is very attentive and fulfilled every aspect. 

The large swimming pool is nice and clean, facing the beach. You could enjoy a lovely sunset from the pool on a clear day. There is a kids play area with a water park and gaming arena. Something I see very rarely in resorts in Sri Lanka. Extremely kids friendly and kiddos enjoyed it to the max. 

Overall 5 star stay with full of peace and clamness. Special thanks to the manager Mr. Sujeewa for the excellent service rendered and allowing late chaeckout as well.

Thank you for your heartfelt and detailed review. It truly warms our hearts to know that your family, especially the little ones, had such a memorable experience at Wattura Resort & Spa.

Your kind words about our culinary experience, the attention to detail in our kitchen, and the seamless dining service truly mean a lot to us. It is also wonderful to hear that the ocean waves and warm waters became a favorite spot for your children, even more than the villa pool!

We sincerely hope to welcome you and your wonderful family back soon for another unforgettable stay. Until then, we wish you many more amazing travels and beautiful memories.

Му путешествуем часто, останавливаемся в лучших отелях, поэтому отзыв претендует на объективное впечатление искушенного туриста. Были компанией 4х детей 11, 9, 6 лет, младенца и 3х взрослых.

Мы останавливались в вилле. Всего в отеле, кажется, 10 вилл и 19 сьютов.
 Сказать хочется много, но в отличии от остальных отелей здесь персонал делает свою работу не формально, а С ДУШОЙ!

Как только я написала вопрос про трансфер из Москвы через букинг, со мной по ватсап связался Кальпа, он же с водителем приехал встречать в аэропорт. Он же решал все наши запросы. 

По приезду нас познакомили с нашим батлером Чамиду, он же был официантом, когда мы ходили в рест.

Для понимания уровня заботы о гостях. Когда мы разбили детскую бутылочку Кальпа сам предложил поехать купить новую.
Так же нам нашли по запросу прекрасного педагога по английскому для детей, которая ежедневно приходила к детям на 3 часа. У нее не было местного акцента и они прекрасно друг друга понимали. 

Так же по запросу нам нашли инструктора по кайтсерфингу. Минутах в 10. Занятия проходили в реке. В первый раз было противно🙈

Удаленность от аэропорта. Перелопатив кучу информации по пляжам Шри на финальное решение повлияло большое кол-во детей и младенец. Несколько часов в пути были бы сложноваты, поэтому 40 мин до Wattura на Viano были очень комфортны.

Волны. Это было прекрасно! Они были невысокие, даже 6 летка в жилете с удовольствием плескался сам. До обеда можно было плавать по-настоящему, так сказать за волнами, которые поднимаются ближе к берегу, а чуть дальше(по грудь) их нет. Море ооочень теплое.
Наши дети, как и многие обычно любят сидеть в басике. Поэтому и берем виллы со своим бассейном. Но тут они просились на море! 

Цены в отеле: как в хороших ресторанах Москвы, впрочем как и во всех отелях по Миру.

Ресторан: там ресторан один. Многие заказывают в номер. А мы ходили каждый раз, чтобы не провоцировать муравьишек. Мы минут за 30 делали заказ по ватсап нашему Батлеру и к приходу было все готово. Все всегда очень вкусно! Я была на кухне- там идеальный порядок! Ежедневно работает порядка 10 поваров! Все делают из под ножа, даже всю выпечку выпекают сами.
За 14 дней ни разу ни у кого не было никаких проблем с пищеварением! 
Остроту адаптировали под нас, реагировали всегда на все просьбы. 

Детям: Есть аквапарк и детский клуб, приходили иногда, но больше нравилось резвиться на волнах. 
На территории видели бурундуков, птиц, под деревом у виллы жило семейство, кажется, мангустов. Видели их перебежки несколько раз. 
Мы спросили о возможности организовать детям кулинарный МК. Сказали, что детям еще не проводили, но сделают. И нам любезно организовал Шеф приготовление нудлс и крамблс кукис. Шеф- красавчик!

Менеджмент. MR. Sujeewa каждый раз подходил, спрашивал все ли у нас хорошо, есть ли комментарии. На 29 «номеров» 62 человека персонала!!! Из них 10 человек, которые постоянно проводят тренинги для персонала. Ну какие же все улыбчивые любезные! Везде открывают двери, помогают с коляской.

Что нужно знать. Если что-то не по вашему убрано или что-то нужно, говорите! Устраняют МГНОВЕННО. Постоянно радовали комплиментарными бонусами. 

Вот сюда по-настоящему хочется вернуться!
Спасибо всем персоналу, менеджменту и собственнику за высокие душевный отпуск, облаченный в высокие стандарты❤️","«Мама, я не хочу у��зжать из этого отеля!»","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499080-d15198149-r997200833-Wattura_Resort_Spa-Waikkal_Central_Province.html",

This time I chose Wattura, a little bit further and so worth it. 
It is a fantastic welcome to Sri Lanka.
Bounded by a river and the sea including the actual river mouth. 
Beautiful beach to dip into and very clean. 
If it’s not the beach then a pristine pool sits in the center of the resort. 
Rooms are beautiful we took a villa and it was stunning, comes with butler service, 2 stories and its own plunge pool facing the beach with a private garden. 
It was so regal and comfortable 
Staff were great Yasas was our butler and was on hand with a smile and willing to assist in any way.

Our crew consisted of 6 adults and 4 kids. The booking process was smooth, and I did it online. They have a functional web site and are very responsive with the phone.

Location
It's located inside a tea state in Ragala area closer to Sooriyakanda surrounded by misty hills and cold weather enclosed in a beautiful garden. Getting there is relatively easy and there is only a few hundred meters of road which is unpaved so most of the vehicles can negotiate it. Only large vehicles with very low ground clearance will have problems. We got through with a Mitsubishi Delica and a Suzuki WagonR (For ground clearance reference). The hotel offers transport from the main road in needed and parking is also available in such situation.

The Bungalow 
It's an old tea plantation bungalow converted to a boutique hotel. Originally built in 1880s by Scottish planters who came here. The bungalow remains most of its original glory including raised wooden floor, old furniture, working fireplaces etc… The surroundings are very quiet. The sitting area had a small library with various types of books and magazines. Some of the books are from the colonial era. And everything seems to be maintained very nicely and very cleanly.

Welcome
We received a warm welcome by the manger and the crew and were greeted with fresh flower bouquets. Afterwards we received tea which is produced in the surrounding tea plantation. Tea was infused with natural ginger and served with tasty kithul jaggery. It was nice welcome drink for the cold weather.

Accommodation
We booked three rooms which are Steuart-Suite (Family room with queen size bed and two single beds), Crawford (Tripple room with queen size bed and a single bed) and Macnaugton (Double room with two single beds). The family room and the triple room were extremely spacious. The double room was on the smaller side but adequately spacious. All rooms were nicely furnished and beds had canopies too. All of them had electric heaters. Tea making facility was not available in the room, but the staff attended to all of our tea & coffee requests promptly. Bathrooms were clean & spacious, and all the toiletries were available. Most of the rooms had quick access to the garden which was nice. Beds were very comfy and slept like logs in the night. 

Food
We made our booking on full board basis, so we stayed for all three meals. All meals had three courses. Primarily they offered a western menu, but they were ready to prepare any day-to-day foods within their ability. All foods were made to order. During the dinner we had an excellent garden salad which had lots of ingredients from the chef’s garden. The cream of mushroom soup was tasty and rich. I had a chicken dish as the main which was great. The sauce used was unique one by the chef which uses local oranges from a tree next to the bungalow. I loved it. Some of our group got pasta and fried rice which had unique flavors. For dessert I had coconut cake with ice cream. The coconut cake was unique, and it wasn’t the one I am familiar with but tasted nice. For breakfast most of us had western cuisine. It was fine. For lunch we all had biriyani. The soup was pumpkin with cumin garnished with chili oil. It was the first time I had it, and it was very nice. There was a strong cumin taste on top of the roasted pumpkin. Loved it. Biriyani was very nice too. Usually, I don’t like Biriyani much, but this was good. The fried chicken came with it was also tasty. The sauce they used on top of the chicken tasted nice too. For dessert we got orange curd cake. We all loved it. Even though it’s made of curd it looked like a cheesecake. 

Service
We received excellent service from the hotel staff. The staff were extremely friendly and quite happy to respond to our requests. The two families joined for this had their anniversary, so we thought of having two cakes at the dinner as a surprise for them. The hotel staff fulfilled it in very short notice, resulting in a truly memorable occasion. All the aspects of the service included a personnel touch which conveyed a homely feeling. Even though we stayed for one night we were so familiar with the staff by the dinner. We all loved the great service from the friendly staff.

Experience
Apart from the nice service of the friendly staff, freshly cooked tasty food, comfy rooms and the nice library there are a few other things to experience. The garden is very nice and there are many places to sit and relax to have fresh air. It’s large enough to play with you kids, which we did. We also had a stroll in the tea plantation which was nice. There are few excursions available, but we didn’t have time or plan for them. There is also a game room in the bungalow which has a mini pool table. We had a good time with it. Apart from that carrom, checkers were also available. The chef who cooked us very nice meals offered a tour to his garden which consisted of leafy greens, lots of western herbs, some local herbs and veggies. Almost all the foods had something from this garden. We also got the glimpse of the orange tree which he made a sauce out of its fruits the night before.

Overall, we loved the stay at the bungalow. It's an excellent place for families or a small group of friends to have a relaxing time experiencing great hospitality with homely touch.","Comfy stay and great hospitality with homely touch...","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g22951028-d9708546-r1009145280-Scottish_Planter_Bungalow_Thema_Collection-Sooriyakanda_Central_Province.html",

Nestled in the tranquil hills of Ragala, this heritage bungalow dating back to 1880 welcomed us with warmth, serenity, and unmatched hospitality.

After a long 16-hour journey with my infant son, wife, and mother, we arrived at 10:30 PM — yet everything was perfectly arranged for us, thanks to Manusanka, the ever-gracious property manager. From coordinating a pick-up van for the 1.2 km off-road trail to ensuring we had everything we needed upon arrival, his care made us feel right at home.

The bungalow itself is a living piece of history — impeccably maintained, tastefully appointed, and surrounded by lush greenery, landscaped gardens, and the peaceful sounds of nature. The set-course meals were absolutely delicious — every dish was prepared with love and left us wanting more.

A special thank you to Kapila, who attended to us throughout our stay with kindness and attentiveness. Whether it was adjusting breakfast to suit our preferences or ensuring we had everything we needed, he truly made a difference.

This is a remote getaway, and that’s exactly its charm. Birdsong by day, starry skies by night, and the pure stillness of nature all around — it’s a place to disconnect and truly rejuvenate.

We’re grateful for the experience and look forward to returning again.
Thank you, Manusanka, for your incredible hospitality — and for the lovely conversations we’ll always remember.

The property is extremely well maintained and the pride of the staff really shows through. The road up to the bungalow is currently unmade although I believe that will be paved shortly.  However, it does mean there is no passing traffic.
Thank you to the Manager, who took us on a walking tour around the tea estate and who clearly takes pride in the Bungalows, thanks to the very skilled Chef whose food was a special treat, and to the rest of the staff who were so attentive, smiling and friendly.  
The weather up in the hills can change from morning mists to sunshine to cooler evenings and what a treat in the evening to have fires lit in the sitting and dining room making it a day of special surprises.","A unique stay","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g22951028-d9708546-r1000077284-Scottish_Planter_Bungalow_Thema_Collection-Sooriyakanda_Central_Province.html",

Wifi is only available in that one room and it is spotty.  There is no television. When the staff is cooking,  the power frequently goes out and it is totally dark in the rooms at that point.  But they quickly reset the breakers. We considered the quirks part of the charm. Our dinner and breakfast were the best meals we had in Sri Lanka. The only negative for us was the location.  It was an hour drive from Nurwala eliya and after a very long day we didn't want an additional hour drive time. Once we saw the place, we were glad that we had chosen this B&B.

We stayed 3 nights. My mom and dad were not feeling well when we got to the bungalow. I was so worried and nervous about the situation. Team was very supportive and they went above and beyond making us feel home and prepared meals according to our requests and it helped my parents to feel better quickly. Mr. Manusanka reassured me that if there is any emergency let them know even if its late night they will be there to help us. Luckily my parents were feeling better the next day and we had a relaxing time there. Team is very kind and compassionate. 

The location is best to relax and unwind. They have a well maintained vegetable garden. Some juices and meals were prepared from freshly plucked vegetables and fruits from the garden. Chef Bandula prepares incredible dishes. There's a unique taste and variety in the dishes. The taste of the food ignite burst of flavors yet well balanced. One of my favorites is a garden salad he prepares. 

I am thankful for their great hospitality. We highly recommend the Scottish Planter Buglalow. Also, we will definitely visit the place again.","Wonderful time at Scottish Planter Bungalow!","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g22951028-d9708546-r981401516-Scottish_Planter_Bungalow_Thema_Collection-Sooriyakanda_Central_Province.html",

Overall a calming, relaxing and pleasurable stay.

Check-in was a breeze—smooth, welcoming, and full of warm smiles that instantly made us feel at home. Throughout our stay, the staff were consistently friendly, professional, and genuinely helpful. A heartfelt thank you to Devin, Shashika, Pubudu, Sandaruwan, Divya, Ishani, Roshani, and Sandushi – your hospitality was truly exceptional and made our stay so memorable. Keep up the amazing work!

Our room was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The housekeeping team was fantastic—always cheerful and ready to help with anything we needed. We especially loved the cozy beds, the reliable hot and cold water, the well-stocked minibar, and all the little thoughtful touches that made a big difference.

One of the best parts of our trip was just being surrounded by nature. Waking up to birdsong and spotting animals like squirrels, rabbits, crocodiles, deer, and even buffalo right around the property was magical. It really felt like we were part of the wild, in the best way possible.

A highlight for us was definitely the “Crocodile Day” event organized by the Nature Trails team. It was such a well-run and engaging session—complete with snacks, drinks, and fascinating info. Huge thanks to Rohan and the entire Nature Trails crew for making it such a fun and educational experience. We learned so much and really appreciated the effort that went into it.

The food at Cinnamon Wild deserves its own shoutout. Every meal was a treat, thanks to Chef Nandana Perera, Sachini, and the entire kitchen team. Everything was so delicious—we were seriously spoiled!

Special thanks to Sahan, the F&B Manager, and the amazing restaurant team: Himanshi, Champika, Heshan, Ishan, Danushka, and Umesh. And a big thank you to Himal, the Chief Steward, for being so kind and supportive.

All in all, we couldn’t have asked for a better getaway. I’d highly recommend Cinnamon Wild Yala to anyone heading to Yala. It’s a truly special place, and we’d absolutely love to come back again in near future.","Hospitality That Went Above and Beyond!","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r1013915517-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala

Thank you so much for your kind and detailed review. We’re absolutely thrilled to hear that your stay in our Beach Suite was such a memorable and relaxing experience, and that you enjoyed the seamless check-in and checkout process. I’ll be sure to pass along your appreciation to Mr. Akash and Mr. Bandula for their excellent service.

It’s especially heartening to hear your compliments about our restaurant team – Sameera, Omesha, and the entire team will be delighted to know they made you feel so well looked after. And of course, Mr. Amar will be very proud to hear how much his cocktails added to your evenings – I’ll make sure he takes that well-deserved bow!

At the same time, I sincerely regret the discomfort caused by the unexpected presence of cockroaches in your room. Please accept our heartfelt apologies, especially knowing of your wife’s katsaridaphobia. While we maintain a rigorous pest control program, your feedback highlights the need for further enhancement in this area, and we are already taking immediate steps to address it more effectively.

Thank you again for choosing Cinnamon Wild Yala. It was a pleasure to have you with us, and we’re truly honored to know you plan on returning. We look forward to welcoming you back for another exceptional experience—this time, even better in every way.

The hotel is big but it manages to keep a very personal approach to the clientele and, as with most of Sri Lanka, you are greeted by friendly staff with huge smiles!!  Our group were accommodated in rooms away from the main building which are spacious and well equipped.  Because some of them are quite a walk from the main building there is a fabulous service where you are taken to and collected from your room.  The walk  to the rooms is a pleasant one past the lake and through the trees where you will see many birds and small animals but after a long day sightseeing the lift to your room is very welcome!!

I was  unwell one day and stayed at the hotel and was visited 4 times (!!!) by 2 different doctors.  The attention I had was amazing.  After leaving the hotel I had messages from the female doctor, Iranga, asking if I was better and enjoying my holiday.  The Reception Manager, Imalka, who always came to the room to see me with the doctor, also text me during the rest of my trip to ask if I was ok and enjoying the trip.  Amazing and thank you to them both!!!!  Your kindness will never be forgotten.

Rooms were serviced well, the food was good, the location was stunning and very convenient for visiting all the various sights in the area and all the staff were truly exceptional.

Also the pool/garden attendants,Nuwan and Udul who made sure we were comfortable in the gardens and around the pool.The jacuzzi bath in the Ocean view room was also a treat.Its easy to get into Galle from the hotel by Tuk Tuk as they are stationed opposite.
The long stretch beaches are lovely for walking along but the sea is pretty rough and not really suitable for swimming-however a few surfers were giving it a go!
If you want your own sun beds then suggest you go for the beach ground floor rooms which open out directly onto the gardens and then you can avoid the minor inconvenience of trying to secure your favourite spot by the pool first thing in the morning.

This is an excellent resort, where the friendly staff provide exceptional service.  Although the hotel advertises that it has three restaurants, most guests had dinner in Whites, the main restaurant, which has an extensive a la carte menu, as well as a daily menu with a smaller number of dishes for those like us who were on half board.  The food was of the highest quality, and as always when we are in Sri Lanka, we mostly ate the local dishes.  Although we have visited the country many times, and enjoyed countless rice and curry dinners, we were delighted to be served some vegetable curries here that we had not previously encountered.  The open sided bar is a good place to have a drink while watching the sun set.  In the day, time can be spent relaxing on a sun lounger, keeping an eye open for the turtles that come at high tide, but there are also many interesting things to do in the vicinity.   Just across the road is an interesting cultural museum dedicated to the work of the writer Martin Wickramasinghe, that includes exhibits related to rural life in Sri Lanka, and a very restful Buddhist temple within walking distance on an island in the nearby Koggala lake. We like using local transport and took the train or bus to both Galle and Weligama, both within half an hour of the hotel.  The excellent service and the beautiful surroundings make this an ideal resort to spend time enjoying Sri Lankan hospitality at its best.","A beautiful resort near Galle","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r994960534-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Our room was a beach room and it opened up onto the pool with the beach just beyond. I loved being able to open the patio doors and having sun loungers just there. The pool staff were phenomenal, they saw you before you even had a chance to look for them and arranged the loungers exactly how and where you prefer. The restaurant was brilliant, Samantha and the team really made us feel welcome and greeted us everyday by our names. We ate in White most days but tried out the teppanyaki (brilliant) as well as the restaurant in the wine cellar - Duo. All the food was superb and there’s a wide choice, the Sri Lankan food was super tasty. There is a buffet on Saturdays which guests, not in the hotel, come to so that should show how good it is but they’re willing to cook you anything should you not want the buffet. My husband and I both had spa treatments which we enjoyed, the spa itself is a little dated and it backs onto the main road so you can hear horns beeping whilst having your treatment which was, sadly, not very relaxing. The only other odd and slightly negative thing was in the afternoon whilst by the pool a large number of crows always appeared trying to drink from the pool. The team did attempt to get rid of them but used a sonar detector which omitted a very high pitched noise and didn’t deter the crows - again not very relaxing. That wouldn’t stop us going back, it was one of the most relaxing hotels I’ve been to in a long time. Galle is about 30mins away and the hotel can arrange transport for you. If you like to go in the sea then be warned it’s very rough outside the hotel, we attempted a couple of times but the current is very strong. There were a large number of trainees either serving by the pool, in the bar or in the restaurant - all of them excellent. As well as Samantha, I would like to mention Sashan who looked after our drinks orders night and day!

Everything suited us perfectly.  We had a suite on the ground floor (room 06) which was a few metres from the most fantastic pool.  The rooms were clean, large and well thought out.  The shower was superb as were the shampoos and body products.  We loved the easiness of being able to access the room from the pool.  This hotel only being 50 rooms, there were enough people to create a nice atmosphere but everything (spa, gym and restaurant were within such close proximity.  

It’s extremely well maintained and so very friendly and personable.  Every single member of staff, from chefs (yes we were given a tour of the kitchens of which they are rightly proud!) to the pool staff were just amazing, although I have to say that all Sri Lankans both inside and outside the hotel are delightful and obliging people.  This hotel has 450 full time staff….yes thats a ratio of 4.5 members of staff to every guest so that gives you a clue as to the attention you receive at The Fortress.  At this point I need to highlight ‘Sam’ one of the restaurant managers and ‘Weena’, one of the spa therapists who both went above and beyond, but in all honestly they were all fantastic.

The food was exceptional, both breakfast and dinner (the buffet on a Saturday night is not to be missed)!!  Again service was second to none.

On a very small negative note, the spa could definately upgrade their products (they don’t do gel nails, which may sound minor to any men reading this, but as I’d broken two nails on second day into my holiday it was a right nuisance)!!  I also think they are missing. a trick not having lovely ayuredivic products for sale despite them having a wall of glass display cabinets in the spa with nothing in!  People love to take a few presents and momentos back home with them  and myself and my cousin would love to have purchased gifts  but apart from the little boutique shop which was unfortunately not particularly exciting with nothing desiresble in there (personally I’d close it or completely start again and make it more upmarket ) there was nothing I wanted to bring back home.  As I said these are very minor points and the massages far outweighed the fact they didn’t sell products.

During the course of our two weeks we stayed in four different five star establishments and all very different in their own unique style (the KK Beach, The Galle Face and the kahanda kanda) but for overall  quality, service, food, pool, beach and value for money it is The Fortress hotel and spa that we will be booking for this time next year.  Thank you for making our holiday a truly memorable one….in spite of the copious amounts of rain!!!","Great start to our holiday at The Fortress","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r991675542-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Tabula Rasa takes your breath away from the moment you arrive and take in the sweeping view. I could hardly speak above a whisper I was in such awe. And then the views from the private villas, and every little detail in the rooms themselves. I felt like I’d arrived home, at the home of my dreams and also in a good friend’s living room. I felt filled with gratitude to be a guest. I came to be nestled in nature, with a higher view for perspective, and to turn my phone completely off to access something within beyond the outer din. I’ve lived half-time in Sri Lanka for nearly 7 years and have traveled all over to nature-inspired boutique luxury hotels on the island seeking peaceful connection with place and self. Tabula Rasa has been on my list since 2021, and while it’s only 20 minutes from home, it took a few years to visit. And I’m so glad I did, and perfect serendipitous timing. The view from here is so unique, a perspective I have not experienced in Sri Lanka before where the main road and all houses in between disappear, and there are only sloping treetops, as if nothing else exists except you, nature, your private view, and luxurious little villa. And if you’ve been waiting to write a book…the writer’s desk has the most inspiring vantage point. I could go in about how well maintained the property is, even in green season, or the views, the delicious and creative food…and the caring staff. A team that you know from interacting with them that they are well cared for, and care well for you the guest in turn. Everything was exceptional. A special thanks to Thilina, Dilshan, and Nuwan for making my stay exquisite.","Agape in wonder and delight, surprise and awe","2025-07","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r1016931009-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Provinc.html",

We also had a massage (by Nawan) who was fantastic.  I had a foot & leg massage and Shell had a full body.  We loved it, he was professional and am amazing masseur.   Note, if you want to go to the beach or beach restaurants, just order up a tuk tuk if you dont have a driver. its not far, but you cant really walk.

A steep drive brings you to the gate of this hotel, nestled in the jungle of Sri Lanka with a jaw dropping view at the infinity pool. 

We were upgraded from a Villa to a Pool Villa, thanks to our HH Gold status. Do reach out to the hotel to receive very good rates and deals! Our room was spacious and could sleep all of our 3 kids. The bathroom was modern and fully equipped with amenities. The master bed was foreseen of a mosquito net, aswell as a mosquite spray (keep windows closed, especially after rain to avoid them).

The patio had 2 sunloungers, a table and a small plungepool. This was ideal to spot the monkey family in the trees, not far from the room.  During our 2 nights we encountered heavy rain and thunder, but skies cleared up in the morning.

Awakened by monkey's on the roof we headed out for breakfast, which was a la carte. Choices and portions were great and service was quick. Small note: paper napkins gives the hotel a cheap look, i would replace them with linnen, as they do for dinner.

We used the main pool once as most of the day we were out exploring.

Dinner is also available and nicely presented, altough staff should refrain to clear plates whenever others are still eating (etiquette). 

Overall, a good choice whenever you are close to Galle and the hotel and room has all you need.","Nestled on a jungle hill with an endless view","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r1003844675-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Provinc.html",

Greetings from our corner! 

We are delighted to read your review.

It was a pleasure having you. We are so glad you chose to spend your vacation with us. 

We enjoyed arranging the homegrown cooking class as much as you did cooking up a storm. Really glad you loved the floating breakfast too. fun fact - It's the most luscious variety on the island.

You stayed in one of our surreal plunge pool villas and nothing beats that view and getting up to those naughty monkeys. Right ?

We had booked a standard room but we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a beautiful villa with a balcony and plunge pool. 

The room was immaculate and very tastefully decorated. The views down to the coast was very impressive and we spent many hours on the balcony listening to the sounds of the jungle and watching passing troops of monkeys. 

Activities and excursions:
On our first day we took a Tuk Tuk to Galle Fort. The journey took around about 25 minutes (priced at 5000 rupees return, with the driver waiting for us whilst we wondered around the fort.

We spent a day in Weligama having travelled there by train from Habaraduwa station. The trip took around about 20 minutes (cost 40 rupees). The main reason for this particular activity was that we wanted to experience a Sri Lankan train journey and this fitted the bill perfect (for a couple who are a bit too long in the tooth for lengthy backpacking style train journeys).

During the rest of our time we visited a local tea plantation and went Whale watching both of which we would recommend.

Facilities at hotel:
At the hotel itself we made use of the pool, spa and yoga master. 

Though the Spa is a little more expensive than a local spa, the hotel’s services were excellent and well worth the money (I should say that the price was considerably cheaper than UK equivalents).

Restaurant:
The restaurant (‘The Dutch’) was excellent and served a range of Sri Lankan inspired high end European dishes. There was an extensive cocktail menu with most drink priced at around $6.

Location:
Though I had been a little worried that the location of the hotel may be a little remote, it transpired that the hotel was perfectly situated to allow for rest and relaxation in a jungle setting whilst only being 15 minutes walk to the local town. 

In our 5 days here we found plenty of activities and it was a great base for exploring this beautiful section of the Sri Lankan coast.

Summary:
All in all we had a wonderful time and would return in a heartbeat. The setting is beautiful and the staff could not be more helpful or accommodating.","Fantastic jungle retreat","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r1000215858-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Provinc.html",

The resort is truly stunning and so relaxing whilst a mere 5 minute tuk tuk ride to the hustle and bustle. The staff are so friendly and will do anything to help. The food is amazing and at such a high standard and we loved Max the resort dog! We will be sad to leave but we will most certainly be back with our son as the resort is also so family friendly! Thank you to all the staff who made our first week of our honeymoon one to remember!","A wonderful, relaxing first week of our honeymoon","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r998089283-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Nous avons souvent voyagé et même dans les hôtels dits de luxe, la qualité de la restauration est souvent catastrophique. Ce n’est pas le cas ici, le petit déjeuner est divin, et le restaurant principal est vraiment délicieux, nous avons testé plusieurs plats à la carte et n’avons jamais été déçus. 
Tout est d’une grande propreté. 
L’hôtel était, pour nous, idéalement placé à proximité des plages de surf et non loin de Galle, Unawatuna, Kabalana, Ahangama et autres villages où nous pouvions nous rendre très facilement en tuk tuk. 
La plage a gauche de l’hôtel est paradisiaque pour s’y promener et s’y baigner.

The most wonderful time at the most wonderful time of year.
The views as you walk through the enormous wooden gates are fantastic.
Beautiful hotel, fabulous food, amazing staff, brilliant atmosphere, the superlatives dont even come close to describing reality.
We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite - a treat to ourselves as it had a few extras and we had a patio as well as a balcony, but all the rooms were amazing. Our bed was the most comfortable we had ever had in a hotel - and I mean that !!!
Each night our bed was turned down but I insisted on opening the blinds - if I woke up I could still see and hear the sea from our bed.
We stayed on an all inclusive package - we had everything we could possibly wish for. Each day breakfast was a mix of English, continental, fresh fruit, traditional Sri Lankan, delicious local breads, with hot stations serving waffles (if thats your thing), eggs cooked to order, but my favourite, Hoppers and Egg Hoppers.
The infinity pool was brilliant, never too busy, and with views out into the waves.
The staff around the pool were amazing - nothing was too much trouble and we always enjoyed sharing family stories with the team.
We rarely had lunch (breakfast was too amazing).
Evenings started with a cocktail followed by the most amazing dinner fare. Sri Lankan, soup, salads, sushi, anti pasti, seafood cocktails and a grill station with the most mazing seafood. Wonderful wines - the list goes on.
Outside the hotel, the traffic had a beautiful chaos about it - pedestrians and cyclists alongside Tuk-Tuks, cars, trucks and buses - oh the buses challenging tuk tuks to that space ahead but with respect from both sides - we should adopt that attitude in the UK.
We had a list of experiences before we arrived and the hotel staff helped us achieve everything we had wished for - and a whole lot more.
Our sincere thanks to our drivers Subash and Ashintha.
Udawalewe National Park with our friend Subash. A fantastic day with elephants.
On Christmas Eve we had a walk around Galle Fort, Lion Beer in The Ivy, then back at the hotel we saw Santa who presented gifts to all the children before an amazing gala dinner.
Our Christmas Day was wonderful - after breakfast we walked along the amazing beach from the hotel - almost nobody on the beach. We visited the turtle sanctuary - baby turtles seem so helpless.....
Boxing Day was the 20th anniversary of the devastating tsunami and we were humbled to visit the tsunami memorial and statue at Hikkaduwa with our driver Ashintha. We shed many tears for the people of Sri Lanka.
The next day was an early start with Subash as we went to Ella via 9 arch bridge. Then a train ride from Ella to Bandarawela in an open carriage, then onto Liptons seat and ending the day hiking to and swimming in the pools at Upper Diyaluma Falls - an absolutely wonderful day.
Our next adventure was whale watching - wow. A speed boat out to the whales, we saw a Blue whale and mum and baby Fin whales. After we  fished from the boat and caught a tuna!! We walked from Mirissa harbour along the beach towards Coconut Hill - the perfect end to a perfect day.
Next adventure was a boat trip on Kogalla lake - what a fantastic experience. We saw crocodiles, beautiful birds, the biggest monitor lizard we have ever seen and we fed fruit to monkeys.
New Years Eve was a wonderful gala with amazing food, a band and superb fireworks on the beach and on New Years Day we were honoured to take part in the Buddhist New Year blessing - THANK YOU.
Our last trip was to Sigiriya - an amazing place with amazing views.
Our most humble thanks to Subash, Ashintha and all the staff at The Fortress Hotel and Spa. Too many to name individually but you gave us so much pleasure and fun - you know who you are.
My special thanks to the Bar Team - I hope I brought some fun to evenings.
Above all else our special thanks to a wonderful lady - Chamindi, you made our stay so perfect - thank you so so much to you.
THANK YOU - we hope we can visit again in the future and to anyone reading this review - Sri Lanka is beautiful, the people of Sri Lanka are beautiful - need I say more.
Love to everyone at the Fortress Hotel and Spa

Food is of top quality. Chef Asela made sure of that and that our dietary requirements were met… vegan, veg and non veg.All the dishes were excellent and tasty.

Breakfast catered for all palates. A good selection to choose from. There was variety of fruit juices ,curries, Continental food,breads, pastries,omelettes, Hoppers, Sri Lankan dishes …very spoilt for choice.

Management, especially Nadeesha made our stay so comfortable. Always greeted us with a huge welcoming smile.Nothing was too much for her.All our concerns were addressed.

The property itself is very well maintained. Pool is beautiful as are the grounds.

During our stay we made such good friends with everyone that it felt like they were part of our family…it was sad to leave.

We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite, which was absolutely huge, spanning two floors and featuring a spacious indoor plunge pool. The addition of a dedicated butler made the experience even more special.

The room was incredibly spacious, well-lit, soundproofed, and equipped with all the amenities we needed. Although we encountered a minor issue with the electricals, the technical team promptly resolved it. The plunge pool was a highlight for us, with the water maintained slightly above ambient temperature—perfect for us and our child, who thoroughly enjoyed it too.

As always, the food was excellent. We opted for breakfast at the resort and tried in-room dining, which, though slightly more expensive than on our previous visits (likely due to exchange rates), was still worth it for the quality and convenience.

The service was impeccable, with attentive and helpful staff who made our visit truly memorable. This level of hospitality is what keeps bringing us back. The Fortress Resort remains the only place in Sri Lanka that we’ve visited multiple times—and it has consistently surpassed our expectations.

This is was my second visit to the Fortress having stayed there in 2012/2013. I am pleased that the hotel has been so well maintained in general, although the rooms and bathrooms could do with a small amount of TLC to bring them back to their best, although they are still very good.

The staff are wonderful, and the food that we had whilst we stayed was good without being very good with the exception of the crab curry, which was excellent.

The atmosphere of the hotel is very serene and it is certainly aimed at the higher end of the market without ever feeling pretentious.

Hotel is highly recommended - the only downside I would see for some is that the beaches on either side of the hotel are not ideal for swimming, however the waves crashing against the rocks from the swimming pool as you sip on a cold Lion beer make up for this and then some.","Still a Great Hotel","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r982055885-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala.

I'm delighted to hear that you enjoyed the comfort of our rooms, the quality of our food offerings, and the convenience of our location for your safari adventure. It’s also great to know that our team could assist with a packed lunch for your full-day safari—thoughtful touches like these are part of what we strive to offer every guest.

I truly appreciate your suggestion regarding the road access and pick-up service. You're absolutely right—the access road can be challenging, especially for low-clearance vehicles. While we currently base our transport support on weather and operational feasibility, your feedback highlights a valid point. I’ll certainly take this up with our team to explore more flexible solutions in the future, as seamless logistics are a key part of the guest experience.

Thank you once again for your honest feedback and for staying with us. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back again soon—with an even smoother experience from arrival to departure.

Yours sincerely,

The rooms are nice and fairly spacious with good amenities. The food was also very good - we ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner one night. They also graciously packed us a lunch to bring while were out on an all day safari. To this end, I'd say it's worth just booking the all inclusive, as there are no other restaurants around the area. You're going to end up eating there anyway, so save yourself the trouble.

My only complaint is that our guide asked for someone from the hotel to come pick us up by security, as the roads in are extremely bumpy and he was concerned for his sedan. The hotel refused because it wasn't raining that day, and as such, our guide had to trek down a dirt and very bumpy road that wasn't made for cars. Having a service to pick-up guests between all of the hotels would have really made things feel smooth.","A Stay in the Wild","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r1012706876-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

It brings me great pride to hear how warmly you were welcomed and looked after by so many members of our team — from Sandushi, Achala, Divya, and Pradeep at check-in, to Chef Manjula and Himal in the kitchen, and Sahan, Amar, and Thamoth at the bar.

And of course, thank you for highlighting the incredible work of Sampath Gunasinghe. His deep knowledge and passion for wildlife is something we value immensely, and I’m thrilled it added so much meaning to your safari.

Your words truly mean the world to me and to our entire team. Knowing that you felt the magic of the wild, the warmth of our service, and the joy of great hospitality is exactly why we do what we do.

Their warmth and hospitality were so genuine — it truly felt like home in the middle of the wild. If I had to describe the experience in one word, it would be magical.

From the moment we checked in, everything was smooth and hassle-free. Huge shoutout to Sandushi, Achala, Divya, and Pradeep for making the check-in process so seamless.

The food was incredible, especially the breakfast buffet! Thank you to Chef Manjula and Himal for not only preparing such delicious food but also checking in on us to make sure everything was up to standard — it absolutely was.

Now onto the cocktails... Wow. A massive thank you to Sahan, Amar, and Thamoth — our amazing bartenders. Hands down the best cocktails I’ve had. If you visit, please try the “Jungle Fowl” — it’s an explosion of flavour and leaves you wanting more!

A big thank you as well to our Nature Trails Yala safari guide, Sampath Gunasinghe. Your knowledge, stories, and passion for wildlife added so much to the experience. It made the safari feel personal and inspiring.

And finally, to Resort Manager Lashanthan Gopalan — thank you for being so warm, friendly, and attentive. You have an incredible team who clearly love what they do. It shows in every interaction and creates such a welcoming, authentic vibe.

It's wonderful to know you appreciated the different experience of staying in a lodge amidst nature, rather than a traditional hotel room.

Our poolside bar is certainly a favorite spot to unwind, and I’m glad you enjoyed the views and atmosphere there. The escorted walks after dark are all part of ensuring your safety in our unique wilderness setting, and I’m happy to hear you felt well taken care of.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala

Thank you very much for sharing your detailed and insightful feedback following your recent stay with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala. We are delighted to hear that among the three Cinnamon properties you visited, ours stood out as the best and that the intimate, jungle-side setting added to your overall experience.

It’s wonderful to know you appreciated the convenience of stepping directly onto the safari jeeps and enjoyed the comfort of our huts and facilities. Your note about the escorted transfers after dark is very important—safety is our priority, especially given the presence of wildlife like water buffalo roaming nearby, and we’re glad you understood the necessity of this service.

We also appreciate your comments about dining options and will continue to ensure our bar and a-la-carte offerings provide a welcoming and enjoyable experience for all guests. Your feedback on coffee and wine pricing is helpful, and we will certainly keep it in mind as we aim to enhance our guest experience.

It’s fantastic to hear you enjoyed the breakfasts, the small pool, and, of course, the safari with its remarkable wildlife sightings. Your recommendation means a lot to us.

We hope to welcome you back again soon for another memorable stay in the heart of the wilderness.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan
Resort Manager

Felt a bit smaller than the others and was all the better for it. Right in the jungle and you walk straight on and off the safari jeeps which is very cool. Huts for accomodation, great shower and the air con worked OK.  You do need escorted to and from hotel when its dark, no issue getting the escort though. Think its needed - water buffalo wandered through the resort over one night we were there , not sure I would have wanted to meet them at 11PM!  We didnt eat the  dinner buffet which I dont like, but ate in their bar area where there were excellent tables to sit outside at,  and eat smaller portions off the a-la-carte. A number of people were doing that every night and you didnt feel like an outcast, service there was excellent.   Food was fine, lots for breakfast, coffee average,  beer cheap, wine quite expensive. Same at all Cinnamons.  Nice area to eat at for breakfast. Small pool, very welcome after safari. Didn't do the beach which is close by. Safari was great, lots of birds, elephants and crocs!  Would recommend","Fantastic hotel right in the jungle.

We were in Sri Lanka on a long awaited snorkeling and hiking adventure when I broke my ankle on day 3!😭 ( very stressful!) 
We had to cancel all our travel plans and  accept we had to find a different way to spend the next 10 days. My husband came across Tabula Rasa , what a find ! The perfect antidote to a disaster 😊✨
Every thing was heaven sent. They gave us a ground floor room overlooking the jungle ( monkey watching included) and the sea ( cooling breezes) The room was spotlessly clean, fragranced and comfortable. Fresh water every day , minibar , snacks , nice products. Perfect! The staff were so caring, smiling and attentive. The owner was there and was super friendly and had a great rapport with his team which is great to see. 
The pool was beautiful with an amazing view. I even managed to drape myself in the shallows with my cast propped up on a yoga mat to keep dry. 
The food was fantastic, we especially loved the Sri Lanka breakfast- amazing! 
We found lots to do around the local area , daily  cultural outing's, beautiful beach bars/ restaurants all a fun and breezy tut tut ride away! 
MASSAGE!! I have to tell you about Nuwan! I booked a couple of massages as I love them and really needed them after my fall . I am a massage therapist/facialist and also train spa therapists for luxury hotels.. so Im fussy! 
Nuwans massage was perfect, firm flowing , professional and above all healing ( my thigh of deep bruising was gone in 2 days , which totally freaked out my husband!😂) 
Nuwan is a magical therapist and you must book at least two massages while you're there . 
We also visited his temple nearby which his father built and he has spent several years painting with beautiful frescoes of the story of Lord Buddha . He showed us around and explained all the paintings which was really special We were also blessed by a senior monk  😊✨
Every thing about our stay here was wonderful , dont hesitate, get it booked!! 💫","Life saving heaven!","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r994556285-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

You wake up to the sound of nature to enjoy a simple continental or Sri Lankan breakfast (must preorder the night before) over looking the pool, onto the forest and the sea.  It is easy to forget your worries and immerse yourself in this serene surroundings. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay by another night, and during our entire stay there was only one other family, making it a truly exceptionally peaceful experience.
It is important to note that the hotel is located up the mountain so be prepared you will need to get a tuk tuk or a driver to get you to and fro the hustle and bustle of the coastal towns. If you are keen on being amongst the action, this will feel highly inconvenient. 
If you are committed to quietude I would highly recommend going for the larger rooms, as it truly elevates the experience and don’t forget to treat yourself to a spa treatment as well. 
The hotel is well appointed and maintained, but the furnishings are starting to get a little run down if you examine closely. The staff are plentiful and helpful, however some are a little amateurish. They do run on island time so if you are in the rush (eg early check out), you have been warned. 
Overall a wonderful experience at an excellent price point - at around $250 USD per night, I would come back again.","Total relaxation in a tranquil setting","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r985191957-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I had an amazing 6 nights at this beautiful oasis. You feel like you are a million miles away but are in fact just a few mins by tuk tuk from shops, beach bars and more - you just wouldn't know it as it is so peaceful and serene.

The main pool is an infinity placed to enjoy a spectacular vista. Some rooms even have their own. My villa was spacious and exceptionally comfortable. Great big bed and top quality furnishings.

The food is scrumptious and plentiful. Great selection of drinks and a minibar in the room too. There is a spa and the massage/mani/pedi were most welcome.

The owners and GM are a delight and they are supported by an attentive teamwho can cater for all your needs. There's even a 'butler' app so you can plan excursions, order food and drinks to your room/pool/lounge. Whenever I wanted to go out, a tuk tuk or cab was summoned so you could experience local attractions. Or you could, as I did, sometimes just laze by the pool, cocktail in hand, good book and a full heart.

Highly recommend if you want somewhere to unwind and reset.","Stop scrolling and book - fabulous stay.","2024-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r984951448-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel was everything I had hoped for and my only disappointment was that we could only spend 2 nights on the edge of the amazing Sri Lankan jungle.

For my wife and I the highlights had to be the wildlife that could be seen and heard from the privacy of our balcony or the feeling that as we walked from our chalet to the restaurant/bar area we were walking through the jungle!

The welcome from all the staff was friendly and helpful; I always feel a bit guilty mentioning individual team members but Akeela who ran proceedings in the restaurant and Dilshan who was ever present as front of house were both excellent ambassadors for the hotel.

Chef Amith served excellent food and I was delighted at the range of vegetarian offerings for my wife. The F&B prices were reasonable and the views from the lounge and restaurant were beautiful.

We were upgraded to a Plunge Pool Suite which was a private villa with a balcony overlooking the jungle and a plunge pool on the decking where we could relax and watch the beautiful sunset. The room was well appointed and immaculately clean.

I booked via the Hilton Honors App but I have a feeling that booking direct with the hotel could provide future guests with a better package. Mr Dilin who is the Resort Manager was very helpful during the booking process and I found Whats App a good method of communication.

Overall, we had a lovely stay and will definitely be back, hopefully for longer next time!

I wished we could extend our stay, unfortunately for us, the place was fully booked. 

Specially the manager Manusanke took care of us like family. The Head chef made sure our meals were a perfect delight! ( I mean food was brilliant ) All the hotel staff were super friendly and hospitable (our kids were loud and playful) Staff were very kind and considerate at all occasions ❤️

Interior and the exterior (garden) was well maintained. We will never forget the experience. I believe we found our annual family getaway location.

Granted we’re not luxury travelers so this was a bit of a splurge, but it was 100% worth it.

The scenery around the estate is so good you don’t need to do anything else in Nuwara Eliya—a few days here with the local tea factory tour on day 2 is more than enough.

We were welcomed with the best tea I’ve had in Sri Lanka, served with jaggery. The chef not only served dinner whenever we liked, but even showed us how he made the dessert dish after I raves about how good it was. He went to the trouble of arranging everything for us to see in the kitchen, and had even prepared little chef hats for us to help him. 

Everything about this place is immaculate. The grounds, the cuisine, the rooms, the staff (observant but not intrusive), the fire burning in the fireplace as we had dinner. 

This place is in my top five, without a question. 10 out of 10, will definitely do it again.

It blends perfectly with the misty landscape, surrounded by greenery but the approach was a bit challenging without a paved road for cars, All those difficulties dissipated once we arrived at the place, greeted by their warm welcome.

During our family trip to Ragala, every moment became a lasting memory. Right after I booked, Mr. Thennakoon contacted us to discuss room arrangements, asking the weather, showing the genuine care typical of Sri Lankan hospitality. Throughout our stay, a sense of sharing and caring surrounded us, leaving a lasting impression.

The staff didn't just greet us; they warmly welcomed us, creating a calm atmosphere that defined our whole stay. The bungalow, restored with care, reflected an appreciation for English architecture, with simple and elegant technology that embraced a simpler way of life.

Our meals, crafted by the skilled Chef, were delicious. Each dish was a delight, especially for my children who loved the flavours. Even though menus are offered à la carte, they accommodated all the foods we requested. Breakfast was the most delicious and thoroughly enjoyed meal. 

The chef prepared special meals for our two-year-old babies, showing genuine care and consideration for their dietary needs. 
We requested take-away meals for the two babies on day 02, and they were packed and prepared with a lovely manner. Normally, when we embark on this kind of trip, we are truly concerned about our babies' food. However, this time, the chef didn't give us a chance to worry. It really helped us to continue and enjoy our trip.

The entire staff stood out for their exceptional qualities, going beyond the ordinary. Their dedication to preserving these virtues made our experience special, and we are truly thankful.

I want to express my sincere thanks for the immense joy this stay brought to my family. Our time in the Scottish Planter Bungalow wasn't just a break; it became a cherished memory for all of us.","A Memorable Stay at Ragala's Scottish Planter Bungalow","2023-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g22951028-d9708546-r925687131-Scottish_Planter_Bungalow_Thema_Collection-Sooriyakanda_Central_Province.html",

I went with my family. It was an unmemorable experience for all of us. This is the first time we ever had been to Ragala.
Soon after I made the booking Mr. Thennakoon called me from the bungalow who inquired about the room arrangement simply because my family was too big. I felt the warmth of rich Sri Lankan hospitality through out my stay, where sharing & caring was felt by all of us from the bottom of our hearts. Staff was waiting to welcome us & never was in a hurry which made our stay a calm enjoyable one.
The bungalow had been completely restored in a manner some one can admire the English architecture. All the technology used is very simple & beautiful, teaching the simple human life style.
We enjoyed three meals made by the Chef, which were delicious & all my children enjoyed their taste a lot.
Mr. Madusanka, Mr. Mogan & all the other staff members were simply amazing when comes to the preservation of admirable human qualities which are beyond the majority.

My wife and myself traveled on Monday the 23rd of June. The experience was great from the point of booking. Indika was nice enough to provide an upgrade to a junior suite at the point of booking itself.

Location:
This property is situated at a very convenient location bordering the main road at Hikkaduwa with a large seafront. The beach is very clean and beautiful. Since we travelled in the off season, the sea was rough and not suitable for sea bating. Buth the sea was beautiful with large waives and splashes. 

Facilities:
This hotel has a spacious living area and two restaurants. One is situated at the ground floor and the other one, a Japanese Restaurant, is situated at the roof top. The hotel has a nice little library, a spa and a gym as well. 

Rooms:
The rooms are modern and very clean. It has very good ambiance in the rooms. The bed is comfortable. The room has tea and coffee making facilities, a shaving kit, shower caps, sewing kit etc. that are very handy. Our room was upgraded to the Junior Site by the hotel without even requesting the same and that suit was large and well maintained. 

Garden:
There is a garden area with several chairs and pool decks that let people relax. The pool is a small one, but it is enough for a mid-size hotel such as the Riff. 

Food:
The food was ample and tasty. The food provided by the hotel is very tasty. The restaurant staff were the main plus point of this hotel. The four-course menu was too much for both of us as the portions were very generous. All the food that we ate was very tasty. The desserts were also very good with the home-made ice cream being the best. 

Service:
The Benisha was very attentive and the boy who served us, Reshmika, was accommodated to all our requests very much willingly and with a smile on his face. They went out of their way to serve us better. All the other people on the restaurant team, including the girl who served us dinner and the other boy on duty today were also excellent.    

Overall:
I could recommend this hotel to any person coming to enjoy a good relaxing holiday with good food and good service.","Great food Excellent Service and a Great Location Location","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1015136840-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

You have use of the pool for a small fee. On the roof terrace, you see a spectacular view of Hikkadua beach itself. It’s wonderful at sunset and very romantic.

Staff are immaculately dressed, professional, engaging and attentive. I’ve swam in several pools in Hikkadua and this is so far the best one. Not too much chlorine and it’s colder than other pools also. The view overlooks the beach. The cascading waves that crash into the beach is fantastic. The pool area is surprisingly peaceful and idyllic.

The atmosphere is both calm and welcoming! Staff opened the car door, helped with my bags, welcomed me in the lobby with a drink and showed me to my room with a quick but informative tour.

And what a room! And what a view! And what a tub! And I could just keep going. I had a permanent grin on my face during my stay and I so regret not booking more nights! The room was amazing, it was clean, cool and well prepared for my stay, even had some classical music playing as I arrived. The balcony was large and had a great view of the pool area, palm trees and the ocean. From the tub and shower you could also take in part of the view.

The pool and pool area was very calm! Most people had chairs down on the beach so I could even swim alone in the pool. Staff was very careful to inform and ensure that no guest went into the ocean due to rough waves for our own security. Once you find a chair on the beach or by the pool they bring you towels and a refreshing water bottle.

Dinner on the rooftop was relaxed, only a few guests and food was tasty and service quick. Breakfast was also a good experience! Attentive staff, easy to order, many options and what a view!

The only complaints I have are few. Firstly I wish the bed was softer. Secondly I would have liked to have been informed that while I went for a massage a member of staff would enter my room after check-in to get it ready for the evening by pulling down the curtain and undoing/redoing the bedlinens. Thirdly the prices shown on the massage-menu are not the actual price and I was not informed during booking but only when I arrived for the massage. Seeing as I had been looking forward to it I was not likely to cancel then. The massage was nice, although I would have liked the massagebed to have a spot to rest my arms while lying on my stomach. 

All in all it was great! The Riff is by far the best hotel I have ever visited and before leaving I was already planning my next trip back!

Thank you for a wonderful stay!","Absolutely spectacular - Five stars!","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1006882311-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The views are fantastic, the rooms large and beautiful. Staff are super friendly and helpful.
You can lie on the sunbeds and order drinks, which is not a given in Sri Lanka.( currently staying at the Taj in Bentota- they have no beach facilities- you have to pay to use sunbeds, no drink or food).
The breakfast was a la carte, and very good. Cool rooftop bar/japanese restaurant- great food and drinks with relaxing live music.

The staff were incredibly friendly, and both my friend and I really enjoyed our time there. I arrived early on the first day, and thankfully, they allowed us to check in ahead of time, which was much appreciated.

The hotel is located right by the seafront, offering lovely views. However, the sea can be quite rough, so it's not really suitable for swimming.

The area around the hotel is fairly quiet, but there are a couple of great restaurants just in front of the hotel that I’d recommend: Two Brothers Palace (cash only) and Bella’s (accepts both cash and card). Both offer authentic and delicious food.
The hotel is about 30 minutes to an hour away from other popular spots like Mirissa and Galle. I’d recommend taking a taxi, which is quite affordable—around £20 for a round trip. We used a company called Less taxi throughout our trip.

The hotel also helped us book an excursion for £126, which included a visit to Ella and the Elephant Sanctuary. A hotel staff member picked us up at 4 AM in a comfortable Mercedes van equipped with Wi-Fi and chargers. He stayed with us throughout the day and ensured everything went smoothly. They even provided a generous breakfast box for the trip. All in all, a really memorable and well-organized experience.

When we checked out the hotel they kindly gifted us some Sri Lankan tea – would highly recommend this hotel.","Fantastic stay","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1001724654-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Food was great, really diverse choice for breakfast. Not a buffet stile but I loved it even more. I tried different things every day, and everything was yummy. We had lunch by the pool every day. Also had dinner at Japanese restaurant on the top floor twice and it was delicious. 

Best thing was a beautiful infinity pool, chairs on the beach ( you can always find a spot ) and a gorgeous white sand beach. Waves in front of the hotel were too big for swimming in the sea but I could have watched them whole day :) you can swim just few minutes walk down the beach. And it is a great place for surfing so we tried that also. There are lots of restaurants on the beach also great food. And great beach for morning run/walk.

Отель отличный. Очень удачное местоположение - немного на отдалении от самого цента городка Хиккадува, но это большой плюс - нет шума и суеты улицы. Тишина и атмосфера, способствующая отдыху и расслаблению. Поездка на тук-туке до центра занимает 3 минуты (цена около 300 рупий - это примерно 100 рублей). Можно и пешком пройтись - это  примерно 10 - 15 минут)
Сам отель очень уютный. Отличный видовой бассейн. Свои лежаки на пляже.
Отдельно хочу сказать про персонал! Это отзывчивые и добрые люди! Все! Готовы придти на помощь в решении абсолютно любого вопроса. 
Про ресторан в отеле - у нас были только завтраки. Очень вкусно! Огромный выбор блюд. Заказ по меню. Меню на завтраке очень разнообразное! Все блюда прекрасного качества и, что немало важно, эстетичная европейская подача! Прекрасно работают официанты! Ни минуты лишнего ожидания! 
Несколько раз ужинали в ресторане отеля. Это действительно вкусно! По сравнению с ужинами в городских кафешках - просто супер! Еще раз хочу отметить качество блюд и чистоту!! Огромное спасибо менеджеру ресторана Benisha. Очень улыбчивая, внимательная и отзывчивая девушка! 
Я бы ОЧЕНЬ рекомендовала этот тихий спокойный респектабельный отель парам, семьям с детьми и взрослым людям!

Nestled amidst the lush green hills and surrounded by meticulously maintained tea gardens, this charming bungalow proved to be a haven of tranquility and timeless elegance.

From the moment we stepped foot into this over 100-year-old heritage building, we were transported back in time while still enjoying modern comforts. The architectural marvel that stands before you pays homage to the Scottish planters who once graced the lands of Sri Lanka in the 1880s. The intricate design elements and awe-inspiring colonial architecture are a testament to the rich legacy that this place holds, and it's heartwarming to see how well it's preserved and cherished.

Our family of avid travelers was accommodated with utmost warmth and care. The staff's genuine hospitality made us feel like cherished guests in a dear friend's home. Every corner of the bungalow seemed to tell a story, and we couldn't help but be enchanted by the cozy atmosphere that enveloped us. Our spacious and tastefully appointed room was a perfect retreat after exploring the surrounding tea plantations and breathtaking landscapes.

Mornings were a delight as we woke up to the soothing melodies of nature and enjoyed hearty breakfasts overlooking the verdant gardens. The serenity of the surroundings and the crisp mountain air were truly invigorating, and we relished every moment spent on the property.

Whether you're seeking a romantic getaway or a family retreat like ours, Scottish Planter offers an experience that transcends time. It's a place where history, nature, and warm hospitality converge to create cherished memories. As we bid adieu to this enchanting abode, we left with hearts full of gratitude and a promise to return to this haven of peace and elegance.

There is not a single thing I would change. It was an exceptional hotel in every way. 
The resort was spotlessly clean throughout. 
Our welcome was fabulous with all that days team greeting us,  including the general manager Dillon. 

Our room was comfortable and we had magnificent views from the balcony. The room was kept clean throughout our stay. There is a focus on environmental issues and so the towels were changed every 3rd day,  but if we needed fresh towels sooner we could have them.  Bathroom ""stuff"", (Shaving kits, toothbrushes, soap etc) were all environmentally friendly. 

On arrival the chef came and checked our individual requirements. I am a vegetarian and I have some food allergies. I also HATE coconut!  I knew I would have to ""put up and shut up"" going to an Asian county. However,  this was not the case. Each and every meal I had was freshly prepared with no coconut. I had the most delicious food whenever we ate at the hotel. Thank you to the head chef and the catering team.  A Special mention to Akila, the waiter and general lovely man. He was a breath of fresh air with kind and gentle service. He was quick to learn our preferences ( me: black coffee.  My husband: tea with milk and sugar). Nothing was too much to ask. 

The front of house was always well managed and Upeka was so kind and welcoming.  She helped to arrange many things for us and was always interested in what we had booked and where we were going. Packed breakfasts were arranged if we needed them. All her suggestions were appropriate and helpful. 

The hotel arranged a driver for us when we needed, including our airport transfers. Samira was a gem. He was a top guy with a lovely sense of humour. We felt completely safe being driven by him and once again nothing was too much trouble. 
The hotel also suggested the local Tuk Tuk driver,  Ataru. He was fantastic, once again we felt very safe being driven by him. 

The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the gardens are particularly pretty. All the garden and maintenance team were a pleasure to engage with. They always had a smile and wave. 

The pool was fabulous overlooking the jungle and we frequently saw the monkeys whilst watching from the edge of the infinity pool.

If I sound like I'm overdoing the praise,  I'm not. It truly was a fabulous as this,  and then some. 

Wonderfully relaxed but there was attention to detail throughout. 

I hope I haven't missed any one out of my review.  There really are no negative comments to make. 

The Sri Lanka way of life is gentle and kind and we experienced this from every person we met at Tabula Rasa. 

Thank you..... we'll be back in another couple of years.","Don't bother looking elsewhere. Fabulous in every way.","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r970962878-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The scale ends at ""Excellent"" but it is not enough, It is ""Excellent"" +++++.

We had a lovely week stay in this place and OMG. , it has been the best experience we have ever had anywhere. From the very first moment on site, we felt like at home.  The Resort itself is very well maintained and well planned. They have thought about everything you might need during your holidays. The Plunge Suit with Ocean and Jungle view was awesome. The infinity view pool was fantastic and clean, we enjoyed our time just having a drink and chat in a swimming pool. In the evening we enjoyed just sitting at our private terrace so we can listen to the sounds of jungle. 

However, this all would be just ""excellent"" without the people working here. They are literally AWESOME. Always friendly, always smiling, always happy to help but also just to have a small chat. Best hotel team I have ever met in my life. Food quality, taste and service is like in the best restaurant in the world. We highly recommend to eat local dishes as they are simply fantastic, tasty and well balanced. 

They of course offer burgers, pizza and other European meals, but why would ask for it if they have such lovely Sri Lanka cuisine? If you worry that your kid will not find anything to eat - worry no more. They have great pancakes, chicken nuggets, etc.

To sum our holidays up. Thank you, for everything. Time went so fast, but I am 100% sure we will be back. And if you are in doubt, if this resort is worth visiting  - forgive all your doubts,  just experience it. The words cannot express how good it actually is.","One in a milion place.","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r962818143-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The architecture and artefacts dotted around give this place a feel that is different to a hotel. It’s entirely possible to find yourself a patch of serenity somewhere that you would be forgiven for thinking you were the only guests here. The service was by far a highlight; all staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomed, remembered and comfortable, and did so with genuineness. We were only able to eat at the beautiful restaurant and every meal was delicious and carefully presented. I couldn’t say I’ve ever been sad to leave a hotel before staying here. Cannot recommend enough. 

We specially thanks Dilin and Nuwan for there lovely guidance to the Temple and the meeting with the monks and family.

The resort is located at the top of a hill surrounded by a very natural scenic view and a 20 minute drive to Galle.

We stayed three nights and enjoyed a meal at the restaurant on the first.  The food was good, but was our most expensive meal of our stay in Sri Lanka.  Good food though!
Room service was efficient and the teenagers loved the ease of ordering on an app!
Swimming pool is lovely, sun loungers comfortable and monkeys swinging through the trees above adds to the experience.

We had a Dip Pool room which overlooked the jungle and the sea. You truly can watch the monkeys all around you whilst you dip! A magical experience! And the bird song…. Beautiful! 
We walked nearly every day down through the village to the most stunning beach area- quite often with no one or very few people on it! Walk back is up hill and sultry so take water! 
The hotel is as amazing as it is, due to  the staff! Nothing is ever too much trouble ❤️ we were looked after wonderfully by the team but special thanks to Milinda, Sahan, Akila, Samira and kithmina. They were all so kind and attentive in making sure our stay was special. 
The food is great, we were half board and were happy to eat at the hotel. The chef, Mohan, was so kind in adapting some dishes for me as I’m pescatarian. Again nothing was too much trouble ❤️
Plenty to do in the area, or not if you’d prefer just to lie back and relax in the hotel. 
Literally my own criticism is they need more beds around the pool. 4 moveable beds with 2 umbrellas are fine but the built in beds, whilst a nice idea, are in the shade from 10:30 onwards.if the hotel is busy you’ll be in the shade all da. We at least had our room and pool if we couldn’t get a bed but not everyone has the option. 
I’ve never stayed at a hotel where the staff buy you a leaving gift, with such special thanks to Upeka for that! And also for being such a wonderful human and adding to the ‘special’ of this hotel!

First of all, we thank you for this thoughtful and detailed review! It truly means the world to us that you had such a fantastic stay and enjoyed every aspect of your time with us.

We're delighted that you loved your double deluxe sea view room and that the little touches, like the complimentary teas and our commitment to sustainability, added to your experience. Providing a plastic-free environment is something we take great pride in, and it’s wonderful to hear that it resonated with you.

Our culinary team put great care into creating delicious, varied meals, and it’s great to know that they were able to meet all your requests. And, of course, we’re so pleased that you enjoyed the rooftop bar and our specialty Japanese restaurant, there’s nothing quite like watching the sunset with a great meal and a breathtaking view!

It’s lovely to hear that you made the most of the beach and poolside loungers, as well as the refreshing King Coconut while soaking in the coastal beauty. Your suggestion about the makeup mirror is much appreciated, we’re always looking for ways to enhance our guests’ comfort, and we’ll certainly take it into consideration.

The view of the ocean was amazing, and the room itself was spacious, spotlessly clean, and equipped with comfortable beds. They also provided an extra bed for my 8-year-old son at no additional charge. The minibar had a small fridge, and they offered free water in glass bottles, which were refilled in the morning and evening. There was a tea kettle with a selection of delicious teas from the Basilur brand, which was also complimentary. The friendly owner of the hotel also owns the tea company, which made it even more special.

I was particularly impressed by the hotel's plastic-free policy. Even the trash bags were made of paper, which made me feel good about my consumption choices. We opted for full-board, and the food was delicious and varied, served à la carte. I would like to give a big compliment to the chef for consistently meeting all of our special requests. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout our stay.

The hotel also features a rooftop bar, which is particularly stunning during sunset hours. The view from up there is breathtaking, making it a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Additionally, at the same location, there’s a Japanese restaurant that serves delicious sushi. We had the chance to try it, and it was a great dining experience—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. A wonderful addition to our stay!

The hotel has direct access to the beach, and the loungers by the pool and on the beach were comfortable. There were also plenty of umbrellas for shade. I especially enjoyed sitting by the pool with a natural shade refreshing King Coconut, gazing out at the sea. Trees provided shade, and the cool breeze made it a pleasant place to relax during the hot midday hours.

The beach was clean, and compared to the rest of the southern coastline, the water was also quite clear. However, I believe this may change depending on the season. The sea directly in front of the hotel wasn't ideal for swimming due to strong currents, but we had fun jumping in the waves. About 2 km south, there’s a place called Dodanduwa Beach where you can safely enter the water, even with children. It's a great spot for beginner surfers to try standing on the board for the first time.

If you're into snorkeling, you should definitely check out Hikkaduwa Beach, about 2 km north of the hotel. You can easily get there with a tuk-tuk for only 500 LKR. The water is crystal clear, and plenty of colorful fish can be admired. The only downside was the occasional boat traffic and the smell of kerosene, which could be a bit bothersome. The beach does offer natural shade, but since it’s public, there didn’t seem to be any regulations on the boats.

The only thing that could have made this stay even more perfect would have been a makeup mirror with light in the bathroom, which would have been the cherry on top of an unforgettable and truly relaxing vacation with my family.","Excellent stay at a charming hotel with stunning views and exceptional food","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r994425231-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Во-первых, мы хотели бы поблагодарить вас за этот фантастический отзыв и рекомендацию. Мы так рады слышать, что ваше пребывание у нас стало изюминкой вашей поездки на Шри-Ланку. Ваши добрые слова о роскошном пребывании и прекрасно оформленных интерьерах так много значат для нас. Осознание того, что вы нашли каждый уголок комнаты таким великолепным и вдохновляющим, действительно делает наши усилия стоящими. Замечательно слышать, как вам понравились высокие потолки, натуральные материалы и просторная терраса с видом на океан, такое безмятежное уединение!

Мы так рады, что пейзажный бассейн стал особой частью вашего опыта. Наблюдение за закатом из бассейна звучит как волшебный момент, и здорово знать, что это было так захватывающе, несмотря на погоду во время вашего визита.

Ваши комплименты по поводу завтрака вызывают у нас широкую улыбку. Мы рады, что вы нашли разнообразие и вкусы такими приятными, и что шри-ланкийский завтрак стал для вас изюминкой, особенно маринованный лук! Замечательно, что вам также понравилось вечернее меню, особенно ассорти из морепродуктов. Мы счастливы знать, что это принесло столько радости.

Мы также рады, что вам понравились коктейли и вы оценили качество, которое мы стремимся предоставить. Ваша похвала нашему сервису действительно согревает наши сердца. Мы рады сделать больше и больше, будь то улыбка, улучшение вашего шезлонга или отправка вас домой с частичкой Шри-Ланки в виде чая Basilur.

Еще раз спасибо за то, что выбрали нас для вашего пребывания. Мы с нетерпением ждем возможности снова приветствовать вас и надеемся, что в следующий раз погода будет такой же идеальной, как ваш отпуск.","1280","781282335","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/1f/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282336","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/20/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282337","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/21/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282338","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/22/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282339","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/23/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282340","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/24/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282341","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/25/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282342","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/26/caption.jpg","960",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 870 Galle Rd, Hikkaduwa 80244 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80244",,"No. 870 Galle Rd",,"14968725","6.119749","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.11572","Riff Hikkaduwa","481","4.8","10","2","8","24","437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d14968725-Reviews-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://riffhikkaduwa.com/offers/","2025-01-15","OTHER","5","Со второго мЕньший обзор океана, чем с этажей выше, но зато можно ходить в номере и на террасе в халатике или без одежды из-за зелени :)","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Самое дорогое, но самое шикарное место в нашей поездке по Шри-Ланке. Стоимость за ночь полностью оправдывает себя! Интерьер был настолько великолепен, что захотелось запечатлеть каждый ракурс. Высоченные потолки, эко-стиль, переданный деревом, светлыми цветами и натуральными материалами, комфортная ванная комната, огромная терраса с видом на океан и удобной мини-софой... Не совру, если скажу, что захотелось заиметь именно такой загородный дом ^_^ Находиться в номере однозначно приятно.

Что касается остального, отметили четыре не менее важных преимущества:

1. Бассейн. Infinity pool стал нашей отдушиной, так как в те даты в океане (ну, или Лаккадивском море, кому как нравится) бушевали сильные волны, хоть и сам пляж изумительный. Наблюдать единственный закат в ту дождливую и облачную пору из бассейна было волшебно! По-моему, инстаграм был изобретён именно для фото из этого бассейна.

2. Завтраки. Просто разнообразнейший а-ля карт, можно выбрать хоть все позиции (если осилите). Блюда на основе яиц, боулы, выпечка, свежевыжатый сок, и, гвоздь региона, ланкийский завтрак. Маринованный лук из ланкийского завтрака -- моя слабость навеки!!! Платное дневное/вечернее меню тоже достойное, особенно плато морепродуктов -- по сравнению с Москвой, мы бы отдали втрое больше за втрое меньшее удовольствие.

3. Коктейли. По цене сравнимы с большинством остальных кафе и ресторанов Шри (а мы за 2 недели успели побывать много где, и да, алкоголь дороговат в переводе на наши деньги), но, безусловно, по качеству многих задвинут. Очень вкусно.

4. Конечно же, сервис. Персонал без улыбки никуда не ходит. Всегда поинтересуются, как дела, как проходит день, принесут комплиментарную холодную!!! водичку к лежаку, свежее полотенце. При отъезде подарили чай Basilur -- ну чем не солнышки?! 

Хочется ли вернуться? Безумно!!! Осталось попросить у Шри-Ланки отличной погоды в следующий раз :)","Определение слова ШИК","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r989386608-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The rooftop bar is also a great place to relax with comfortable seating for large groups and great views of Hikkaduwa beach from above. The live music is always spot on, with different musicians performing in the evenings from Wednesday to Sunday, perfectly complementing the chilled atmosphere of the venue.

A special mention must be made to the food. Every item on the menu tastes amazing and the selection for all three meals has a lot of variety. The seafood platter is my personal favourite but the Japanese menu is second to none, especially the crispy crab maki rolls. Easily the best sushi in Sri Lanka, outclassing most places offering a similar selection abroad.

The food in the True Blue rooftop bar is lovely, and again, very attentive service. 

The only very small thing that could be a great addition to feel like complete luxury, is to provide a more efficient beverage service at the beachside sun loungers, rather than having to go into the main hotel to order drinks during the day. Saying that, the beachside attendant was super helpful in bringing a bottle of cold water in the mornings, which was fully appreciated.

Невероятно приятно слышать, что, несмотря на неидеальную погоду, ваш опыт в Riff Hikkaduwa сделал ваш отпуск особенным. Знание того, что вы считаете нас лучшим отелем в Хиккадуве и, возможно, на всем побережье, действительно много значит для нас.

Мы так счастливы и благодарны, что вы решили провести один из самых важных моментов в жизни, например, годовщину свадьбы, с нами. Маленькие сюрпризы, такие как торт и шампанское, — это наш способ сделать особые моменты еще более значимыми, и здорово знать, что они принесли вам радость. Также здорово знать, что вы оценили заботу и внимание нашей команды, а также качество нашего ресторана.

Чайная комната и ваше общение с владельцем очень близки нам по духу. Мы так рады, что его жест, когда он делился чаем, сделал ваше пребывание еще более особенным.

Мы искренне ценим ваши комплименты по поводу нашей уборки, обслуживания и бесплатного ужина в ваш последний день. Мы всегда стремимся создать теплую и гостеприимную атмосферу, в которой каждый гость чувствует заботу.

Ваши комплименты заботе и отзывчивости нашей команды много значат для нас. Спасибо, что так тепло нас рекомендовали.

Но отель скрасил всё наше впечатление об отдыхе своим сервисом, качеством и отношением к туристам. Пообщавшись с туристами из других отелей, сделали вывод, что это самый лучший отель в Хиккадуве, а возможно и вообще на всём побережье. Мы много где отдыхали и нам есть с чем сравнить, но этот отель выше всех похвал! Персонал очень улыбчивый, всегда старается угодить и всё делает для комфортного отдыха туристов. Познакомились с владельцем отеля - МЕГА позитивный и добрый человек, хорошо говорит по-русски. У него свои чайные плантации и при отеле есть магазин этого чая. При разговоре с ним, сказали что наша мама очень любит крепкий чёрный чай, так он нам подарил целых 2 пачки разного чая. Это безумно приятно🙏
У нас была годовщина свадьбы, которую мы решили отметить в японском ресторане на последнем этаже. Нам подарили бутылку шампанского и маленький тортик со свечкой и поздравлением. Это очень было неожиданно и приятно!

По поводу кухни это вообще отдельная тема! Ресторанная подача блюд и безумно всё вкусно. У нас были включены только завтраки, т.к. хотели попробовать местную кухню и покушать в разных заведениях. Лучше и вкуснее еды (чем в нашем отеле) мы не нашли. Мы пробовали кушать в разных кафе и ресторанах на побережье и поняли, что ресторан при отеле самый лучший. Многие туристы из других отелей приходили кушать именно в наш отель.

Уборка в номере каждый день. Всё чисто, полотенце меняли каждый день и всегда следили, чтобы в номере была вода. Единственное, что мне не хватало - это каких-нибудь лебедей или слоников из полотенца😃 Но это всё мелочи, на которые точно не стоит обращать внимания)

В качестве комплимента в последний день нашего отдыха, отель нам подарил бесплатный ужин. Такого отношения, мы не встречали не в одном отеле! 

Хочу сказать огромное спасибо персоналу отеля за обслуживание и отзывчивость, шеф повору ресторана за такие изысканные и вкусные блюда и отдельное спасибо управляющему за такое приятное и доброе отношение к туристам. 
Всем рекомендую этот отель!

Эстетика и вкус во всем, до мелочей. На кровати лежало приветственно письмо от руководителя отеля (очень приятно). Номера убирают хорошо и каждый день приносят воду в стекле и свежие полотенца. 

На территории отеля есть два ресторана. Внизу у бассейна.  Видом на океан и на крыше (тут делают кальяны). Кухня вкусная, меню разнообразное, подача красивая. Слышала, что тут готовят самые вкусные суши в районе. Суши действительно вкуснейшие. Иногда играет живая музыка. 

Персонал просто невероятно воспитанный, все доброжелательные и желают сделать твой отдых лучше и еще лучше.

We have to give a huge shout out to the hotel driver who picked us up and dropped us off at Colombo Airport - as well as taking us out for a day to Yala National Park where we had the good fortune to not only see elephants and mugger crocodiles but also a leopard.

Breakfast was excellent and both restaurants have good food and varied menus.  This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the hotel was well placed to not only relax but to also see some of the country, the Old Fort in Galle being another great visit.

 resort.  We stayed in a very spacious garden suite right in front of the Indian Ocean.  The design of the property is really something special, beautiful and sort of an oasis  away from the busy roads, busy tourists area. Every rooms are facing the ocean and wether you are enjoying breakfast or a cup of tea or dinner at the georgous and open  dining area  the Ocean is just in front of you. 

Our suite was extremely comfortable,  extremely spacious and beautifully furnished.  Another key point was the excellent food. We stayed four nights and we had dinner at the property every night due to the deliciously prepared dishes ( Western and local dishes ).  It was so enjoyable to admire the ocean, listen the waves and enjoy high quality meals. The service was also very warm, friendly and efficient.  

Within a sort of short tuk tuk or car drive we could enjoy some very cool cafes yet we were always very happy to return and have our dinner at Sielen Diva.

If you are looking for something different than a busy hotel I am sure that a stay at Sielen Diva will, as it did for us, will create very sweet memories which will last for a lifetime.","An oasis of beauty","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r989454831-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

There is a certain serenity that embraces you as you walk down the entrance hall and in to the spacious and perfectly presented lounge and dining area which looks out across your private pool and down to the beach beyond the gardens.

No traffic noise, just nature and the sound of the waves washing across the rocks and on to the beach.

Everything is special here, the location, the villa, the friendly attentive staff dedicated to your every need, the quality and maintenance of everything, the attention to detail, the food, bedrooms and bathrooms are all wonderful.

The villa boasts 7 bedrooms, 4 to the upper floor, 1 to the ground floor and 2 to the garden area, all are very spacious with comfortable beds and ample hanging and storage, all have large en-suite bathrooms with walk in showers and all but the ground floor have a large bath.
The beds are comfortable, all have tv’s with access to Netflix etc. and there is ample hot water, towels and other bathroom essentials.

The happy and smiling staff are always on hand to provide you the ultimate service and the 2 personal chefs create outstanding food to complement the array of cocktails and soft drinks that freely flow.
We were a group of 6 couples visiting for 3 nights and they happily prepared a delicious and off menu BBQ for us on our first evening.

Always important to mention the things that others might see as a negative so, the beach is beautiful but not for swimming, it’s too rough and rocky, that said , if you walk 5 minutes down the beach you’ll find turtle bay where we swam with turtles.
The wine list is ok but is limited, nevertheless, much better than any other we experienced on our 2 week journey across Sri Lanka (if you’ve been here before you will understand that wine is not really the thing in Sri Lanka), so if you’re a wine connoisseur please don’t be disappointed, we all love our wine and made do with a Zin, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.

In summary, if you’re looking for the ultimate chill-out villa in Sri Lanka this is the place, especially if you are a group or family that wants the place to yourselves, you will not get better!

The villa is a modern beach front villa with only 7 guest rooms. We stayed in the Yanai suite which was very spacious and has the biggest bathroom that we have seen in a hotel/villa; and a fantastic view of the beach and sea. It’s so peaceful and relaxing at Sielen Diva we didn’t want to leave.
Unawatuna is only a 5 minute tuk-tuk ride from the villa, Galle is about 25 minutes away. Every morning we woke to the sound of the waves and a fantastic view of the sea through the huge floor to ceiling windows. The food was of an excellent standard, chef Samantha delighted us with both Sri Lankan and western food. Our favourite were the baked crab and also the Sri Lankan lunch. The cocktails were also varied and totally delicious. 
Finally the staff… they were excellent and provided a personal service, all our needs were met and our expectations exceeded.

Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review and for giving us a rating of 5 star. We are so happy you felt that you had your own privacy though we had other guest, it is especially how we want our guests to feel, as if they are at their own personal beach villa. We are very fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihirpenna beach and the villa was designed where all rooms offer views of the ocean. Our Chefs work very hard on their recipes and they are very particular that only fresh, local produce is used. We are so glad you learnt from the very best how to make a Sri- Lankan meal and I'm sure it is a experience to remember. We will be sure to pass on your compliments to our entire team and very much hope to be able to welcome you back in the future. Please do keep in touch as we love hearing from our guests.

Nous dirons à notre personnel que vous avez été très satisfait de leur service et à notre Chef que vous avez apprécié les repas préparés. C'est un grand honneur que votre séjour chez nous ait été la meilleure expérience hôtelière que vous ayez vécue pendant vos vacances au Sri Lanka.

Everything, from the ambiance to the customer service, was simply exceptional.

The high tea was absolutely amazing, and the pricing was very reasonable for the quality and service we received. The accommodation, the hospitality, and the smooth coordination made the event seamless and enjoyable for everyone.

A special thanks to Mr. Anjula for handling all the arrangements so efficiently, it was incredibly easy to coordinate with him, and everything went off without a hitch. We also truly appreciate the support from his team, Mr. Kavindu and Mr. Chanuka, for their outstanding service. We also thank Mr. Shahran for his assistance!

We highly recommend this venue for anyone planning a high tea, birthday celebration, or a casual get-together.

Jim's Farm is a unique place. From the moment you arrive you know you are in a very special place.  Having visited before it was easy to know how to plan our time to maximise relaxation and exploring/enjoying the culture and sights of Sri Lanka.

We chose to have alternate days  travelling and enjoying the amazing culture of Sri Lanka with indulgent poolside relaxation which worked very well. Our guide and driver , Nihil, is an engaging and knowledge guide and navigated the Sri Lanka traffic and roads with great skill and patience!  He certainly had excellent knowledge of all things local and was able to ensure we experienced the real Sri Lanka, directing us to fabulous places to eat, farm visits , local shopping etc.  We enjoyed all our trips and particularly outstanding was the elephant safari ( apart from the drenching rain on the drive home!), the highlights of Kandy and the amazing Buddha's at Dambulla.

Our relaxing days at Jim's were also exceptional. We would highly recommend an informal tour round the working farm that provides much of the produce for the hotel and restaurant - you have the chance  to chat informally with many of the large team that work the farm. This is no ""set piece"" - the staff go about their daily tasks . There is a real sense of enjoyment as you wander around meeting so many happy people- including the joy of seeing nine 2 week old puppies with their mother!

The accommodation at Jim's is spread over 3 large ""villas"" with tuk-tuks escorting you to the restaurant or pool or reception where the communal activities take place.  The accommodation is stunning - decor is stylish Sri Lankan using local materials. We coincided with a yoga group and joined them for dinner on occasions  and were able to meet the local Buddhist monk who visited and blessed those who wished to participate. The food is exceptional- we enjoyed Sri Lanka specialities and most of the food is straight from the farm and beautifully presented and served.

Jim's Farm is a wonderful relaxing and well positioned place to visit many attractions of Sri Lanka and more importantly it is a charming place to recharge, eat and drink well and recharge. Looking forward to our next visit!","Another fabulous holiday at Jim's!","2024-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1865780-d2650685-r980889737-Jim_s_Farm_Villas-Matale_Central_Province.html",

Jim was my Dad, and a true old style farmer. I’m afraid he died some 30 years ago. But our small family Suffolk farm was no longer economic. So when I retired I decided to carry on our family’s farming tradition, as a 7th generation farmer, here in Sri Lanka. So I named our company Jim’s Farm as a dedication to him.

He was so professional, safe at driving on the mad roads and the clean air conditioned van meant we travelled in cool luxury.  Nihal was also so great with our kids. Our son particularly warmed to him and often played with him while we ate. We could have gone out on many more tours but equally enjoyed the spice farm with its tour, tea & cake, cooking demonstrations & fantastic pool up at Hill Top Villa. My husband and I tried several massages each and highly recommend the Spa. The foot massage was one of the best I’ve ever had. Each and every staff member worked so hard each day. No request was never too much and the restaurant service was impeccable. The beer is cold and the set evening menu each night is diverse between a Western spin and Sri Lankan rice & curry. The breakfast is set in the restaurant with its hill top views and is beautifully presented with fruit, eggs of your choice, toast, great coffee and whatever the kids need to order too. It sets you up for the day ahead. If you leave on an early tour they provide a packed breakfast on request, What really made our stay stress free was how warm and amenable the chef & all staff were with our kids. They played with them and helped us order any meal we felt they would like and be able to eat at lunch & dinner time. Jesse runs a smooth & wonderful ship at the farm. I highly recommend a stay here. We will return with all our family I hope. It’s in such a beautiful lush setting be prepared when it rains it really rains! But when the sun shines you feel above the clouds and can see for over 40kms. I would love to attend a yoga retreat there too. One day! 
Thank you Jesse & Jim’s Farm our stay in the Hikkaduwa beach house and then the farm have given us very special life long memories.

The views were spectacular, including from the shower!   Bed was a good size and very comfy and the room had good amenities and was very clean.

Gorgeous pool at the top of the hill, where we also had lunch served a couple of times. They located some pool toys for our daughter without asking.

The farm tour and milking of the cows was a particular highlight - fascinating to see all the spices, fruit & vegetables being grown, all the coconuts & learning about the cinnamon production in particular. They were kind enough to gift us some black peppercorns and cinnamon to take home, which was a lovely touch.

The staff were exceptionally friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.

We had a Sri Lankan cookery demonstration & tasted some delicious local food, freshly cooked by their talented chefs.

Dinner was not communal, although we all sat down to eat at the same time.  The food was lovely. We had a 4 course set meal which was always very tasty.

We would highly recommend staying here for a few days and enjoying the tranquility, service & facilities.","One of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1865780-d2650685-r913782446-Jim_s_Farm_Villas-Matale_Central_Province.html",

Special shoutout to Kivindi and Chethiya for helping me plan the rest of my trip, and to Kalpana for the amazing service. Such a great team.

My room was spotless and comfy, not to mention I had a lovely ocean view, and the rooftop is stunning. You can see the entire city from up there. The pool was clean and relaxing, and the location is spot-on.

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm and peaceful. One of the best parts of our stay was the hotel's beachfront location, providing us with stunning views and easy access to the beach.

The food was absolutely delicious. In fact, our return trip was largely motivated by the warm hospitality and fantastic cuisine. Everyone in our group enjoyed the meals, especially the biriyani, which was incredibly flavorful and generously filled with chicken pieces and cashews. We were even able to thank the chef personally for making the best biriyani we've ever had.

Special mention goes to the waitress, Benisha. She remembered us from our previous visit and was extremely helpful, always suggesting the best dishes for us to try and doing so with a big smile. She made our dining experience even more enjoyable. Additionally, since my mother is a vegetarian, Benisha provided her with a full board menu featuring a variety of vegetarian dishes, which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

Thank you so much, Riff Hikkaduwa, for making our stay memorable. We truly enjoyed every moment and look forward to visiting again.","A Perfect Retreat at Riff Hikkaduwa: Exceptional Hospitality and Delicious Cuisine","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r960251188-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Очень красивый, стильный дизайн как самого отеля, так и номеров. Моя оценка 100/10
Теперь по пунктам:
1. Номер. Мы брали стандартный и остались в полном восторге. Большой, уютный и с видом на океан. Уборка ежедневная (по 2!!! раза на дню). Также в номере есть все необходимые принадлежности (зубные щетки, мочалки, шампуни, гели, бритвенный набор)

2. Еда. Завтраки были включены в стоимость проживания и они шикарные. Очень разнообразное меню (не шведский стол, но поверьте, каждый найдет себе вкусности по душе). Рестораны на первом этаже и на крыше - наша отдельная любовь😍 вкусно абсолютно всё! Практически каждый день обедали и ужинали там, всегда все свежее и очень вкусное🤤  

3. Бассейн. Ну это наверное самое инстаграмное место отеля))) бассейн большой, чистый, нам практически всегда удавалось занять лежаки возле него. 

4. Океан-пляж. Большая береговая линия, пляж у отеля чистенький, за ним прям ухаживают. Мы были в июне, поэтому именно возле отеля поплавать не удалось, большие волны были каждый день. НО в 7 минутах езды (на тук-туке😁) от отеля есть «Черепаший пляж», и там практически всегда можно купаться, волны маленькие. Кстати там же можно посерфить, очень рекомендую!

Located on the corner of the first floor, it’s a jaw droppingly large room, with floor-to-ceiling windows and an incredible bathroom. 

The view of the water and the sound of the waves from the gigantic windows is magical. 

The a/c was strong and effective. Much needed in Unnawatuna’s heat. 

The bed was large and comfortable. The room is spacious and the size of some apartments. 

The bathroom is probably the best that I’ve stayed at in the world! Light, and spacious. With a powerful shower where water falls from the 11ft ceiling. 

As there are just 7 rooms, the property never feels busy. There are plenty of dining areas and is a fairly private experience. 

Food at this boutique hotel is a highlight. The menu is delightful and food is delicious. Prices are a tad high for Sri Lanka, but not overly so from an international perspective. 

The pool is warm and spacious. And due to few guests, you can have the pool to yourself most of the time. 

There’s a clean private beach on the property. The seas were rough, but was fine for some beach photos. 

The games room is well-equipped with a pool table, football table, darts board, weights, board games, books and more. It’s very hot though and we couldn’t see a fan or a/c. 

Overall we had a great stay, and wished we could stay longer.","Beautiful room, bathroom and property. An excellent stay.","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r941489305-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Even with factor 60 block, we burnt! ","Value","5","Location","5","Service","5",,,,,,,"I honestly don’t know where to start, our stay at Sielen Diva was exceptional! 

From the moment we arrived we received excellent customer service, the staff were all extremely personable and their level of service was outstanding.   

We were greeted with a cool towel and welcome drink whilst we checked in.  Our room was lovely and had a gorgeous view of the ocean, the bath overlooking the sea was a nice touch.   

The room was very spacious with a safe box, plenty of space to unpack, robes, hairdryer, toiletries, free water daily and a very comfortable bed. 

We stayed for five nights and were genuinely sad to leave.  With only seven rooms and ten staff members you feel at home here.  We got to know the team at Sielen Diva well, including the security guards and all were excellent! Honestly the service we received from everyone was above anything we have received elsewhere. 

The villa is beautiful, it was very quiet and peaceful. This place gave us a chance to relax and unwind. On two days we even had the pool to ourselves. 

The beach area isn’t private but due to its location, it’s really quiet and feels like your own private beach.  The hotel guard helped us onto the beach and even provided water to rinse our feet to get rid of sand.  One morning after a walk along the beach, he even got beach towels for us, something unprompted but just shows how lovely everyone was and their desire for excellence service. 

In five days, we only had one lunch and one evening meal away from the villa.  Whilst the food was more expensive than outside the hotel and other places we had stayed in Sri Lanka, it was extremely reasonable for the quality and taste.  You can tell the ingredients are all fresh and the team proudly shared how they sourced from local suppliers.  

The menu had a wide range of options, I opted for fish and seafood each time and every meal was delicious.  My husband tried their local chicken curry, which again was delicious.   Personal recommendations would be the hot buttered squid, banana leaf baked fish, chilli crab, the Sri Lankan curries  and even their club sandwich.   

For our last night we asked if the chef could make us the chilli crab, but with prawns or fish, as the sauce is out of this world!  He kindly obliged, recommending prawns and it was so tasty; it was clear how passionate he chef was about this work.   The hotel manager even sourced fresh local bread for us, just to make sure our last meal was special. 

If you want a lively hotel, this is not the place for you.  It’s very quiet and peaceful; on an evening there isn’t any entertainment, just good food and a chance to sit and enjoy the sound of the waves with cocktails.  We tried out the game room one night,  playing pool, which was fun.  The games room was well equipped but looked like it wasn’t used regularly. 

There are some local restaurants near by, within a short walk, but as we loved the villa and enjoyed the food we opted to stay in the Villa most nights. 

We were in bed by 10pm most nights, having Netflix in the room was a nice surprise as we got to watch late night movies.

We went into Galle to watch the sunset, via Tuk Tuk and had dinner there.  Galle is worth a visit and the Villa offers a Galle tour, something I didn’t known until the last day unfortunately. 

Turtle Beach is about 15 min walk along the road.  It’s a great place to see wild turtles and you can even feed them.  Sadly it gets very busy and many Russian tourists were crowding and touching the turtles, ignoring the do not touch signs.  We went early and stayed until about midday, opting to eat at one of the local beachside restaurants. 

We would highly recommend the villa, it’s a taxi or Tuk Tuk away from Unawatuna beach and Galle but that’s what makes it so relaxing.  If Sri Lanka was closer we would make this a regular holiday spot for a week getaway. 

Thank you to the Sielen Diva team who made our stay wonderful.","A slice of Sri Lankan heaven","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r940511216-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Sielen Diva is a lovely villa in a beautiful location. But what really sets it apart is the outstanding personalised service you get from George and his team. Since this is a boutique hotel of only 7 rooms you will get excellent service and even make a friend or two.

George helped arrange all our trips out (including a lovely Tuk Tuk driver called Laksman) and also took us on a fun early morning excursion to the fish & vegetable market in Galle; Santa and Isuru were always on hand to look after us and chat about life in Sri Lanka; Tusharu created some amazing dishes, often with the catch of the day fresh from the ocean, and gave us a fantastic cooking demonstration; the rest of the team were lovely too and always had a smile. We were also lucky enough to meet the charming owners of Sielen Diva who were passing through.

It's 25 years since we were last in Sri Lanka and while some things have changed (the roads have improved a lot!), the genuine warmth of the Sri Lankan people is the same It's always been.","Beautiful villa, stunning location, outstanding service.","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r937610915-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review and especially for considering your stay with us as being the best vacation of your life.
Our housekeeping team does a clean twice a day with a morning clean and an evening turndown service. We are especially fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihirpenna Beach on an acre plot of land. The villa was designed by the owner to take full advantage of the panoramic views of the Indian Ocean. When the weather permits, there are stilt fishermen directly infront of the villa and our Chefs purchase fresh fish from them. Sri Lanka has wonderful produce and it is especially important to our Chefs that they only use fresh, local produce in their recipes. They also only purchase from the local markets and fishermen directly to help our local community. 
We especially want to thank you for mentioning our entire team from our security guards, to our housekeepers, butlers, Chefs and managers. The whole team work very hard to ensure every one of our guests have a wonderful stay with us and leave with lovely memories so reading your review is very rewarding.

Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review, we very much appreciate it. We are so happy you enjoyed your stay with us. We are very fortunate to be located directly infront of Mihirpenna Beach. Unfortunately we are unable to control the temperature of the pool being in a tropical country and January being one of the hottest months, the water does tend to be at its warmest during this time of year.  
The Aliya Suite is our largest Suite and very spacious with a king sized bed, chaise lounge, a large dining table and separate wardrobe and seating area. Being on the beach lawn with it's own private deck chairs in the front of the room makes it one of our most popular rooms. Unfortunately as we are directly infront of the beach and with the ocean breeze being strong, the beach lawn Suites do tend to often have the ocean breeze scent which some guests enjoy while others do not. We are so glad that after our team did another clean, you enjoyed your stay in the room. We are also glad you enjoyed the breakfast we offered and the service our team provided. 
Thank you for the feedback regarding the tea and coffee, we will most definitely take this into consideration.

We are very fortunate to be located on an acre plot of land directly infront of Mihiripenna Beach and the villa was designed so every room had panoramic views of the Indian Ocean. Our entire team want every guest to feel right at home and we are specifically decided to be a resident only villa so we can ensure we provide customised service to our resident guests in a private and tranquil environment. Sri Lanka has amazing produce and our Chefs ensure the ingredients they use to prepare each meal is only using fresh, local produce. Seafood is bought from the local markets and when the weather permits, from the stilt fishermen directly infront of the villa. We are so happy our team made your stay wonderful and we will be sure to pass on your compliments to everyone. We very much hope to be able to welcome your husband and yourself to Sielen Diva again in the future. In the meantime, please do keep in touch as we love hearing from past guests. 

Kind regards,
The Sielen Diva Family

Everything about this hotel is exceptional, from the staff, to the views to the food... I simply cannot fault it. My husband and I stayed for our honeymoon as we couldn't have asked for a more magical experience, we were greeted by the incredibly friendly staff who would always go above and beyond to make our stay so wonderful. You're immediately made to feel right at home and relax into the gorgeous hotel environment. 

The setting of the hotel is also breathtaking, you can walk straight from the swimming pool onto the beach. It is also a short walk from the popular turtle beach (worth a visit!) but the beach infront of the hotel is lovely and quiet.

The rooms are equally as breathtaking, I don't think I'll ever wake up to such an amazing view again! 

We were also so impressed with the food, the chef was incredible, we couldn't fault it. We also did the cooking class which I would highly recommend too!

There is a high number of staff to guests and they  are all exceptional. We were extremely well taken care of in all respects,  nothing was too much trouble; but we were given space to do as we please.  

The room was spacious with very comfortable beds.  The outside pool was lovely and the sun beds comfortably shaded. 

There is an extensive  range of food and drinks available. Our favourites were the breakfast pancakes and the Sri Lankan curry and Sri Lankan  breakfast.  We also loved the cocktails.  The standard of the food is exceptional and better than where we ate out locally.

On 4 days we enjoyed trips with the in-house driver to the surrounding UNESCO world heritage sites. The driver was level 1 certified. The rate was very fair, the driver very competent and friendly. 

The hotel supported us perfectly by organizing the trips according to the Covid rules and managed all the approvals from the tourist board. Tho hotel also organized local guides.

The location is very beautiful with a magnificent view to the surrounding mountains. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet. We had two huge rooms for our Family.

We enjoyed a cooking course, the farm tour explaining all the plants and spices of the farm, the beautiful swimming pool, a bike tour through the farm and ayuverda treatment.

The luxury meals are delicious and very romantic.

For all these extras (except the car service) no additional fee was charged. This was the only hotel in Sri Lanka where no extra charge appeared at the end of the stay.

Beautiful view out over the pool and lake. Lovely balcony, where you could hear the sounds of nature around. Very tranquil. Friendly and attentive lovely staff, very helpful. We were greeted with a refreshing towel and drink on arrival, check in was easy and we were helped with our bags. It’s a beautiful hotel in lovely natural surroundings. Our bathroom and room was lovely. They gave us a little cake for our honeymoon and a honeymoon message on the bed. They helped surprise my husband with a birthday cake with his name on it. The pool was clean and the perfect temperature. Highly recommend this hotel. I got a foot massage in the spa which was very relaxing. There is lots of options for the food and it is to a very high standard. We visited Minneriya national park and Sigiriya rock while staying here.

The bathroom was equally impressive, offering plenty of space and modern amenities to make our stay even more comfortable. Waking up to the serene sight of the lake every morning was a true highlight of our stay.
The dining experience was great(we opted for half board). The breakfast spread was varied, fresh, and satisfying, with options that catered to all tastes. The evening dining was equally impressive, offering delicious meals with high-quality ingredients.

The hotel is a lovely oasis just outside of Dambulla.  We had a ground floor room with access to the pool which suited us perfectly.  The room itself was large with a huge bathroom containing both a bath and a walk in shower.  Bed & pillows were both really comfortable.

We were out each morning but returned in the afternoon and made use of the sunbeds and pool which were always quiet (no blaring music & no fight for a bed!) & had beautiful views of the lake. 

Breakfast is buffet style with lots of choice & well prepared.  We stayed on a B&B basis but ate in the buffet restaurant each evening as the choice & quality was so good.  I don't think there was anywhere within walking distance that would have been an option.

The gym is small but well equipped.  

All of the staff were friendly and attentive.  We noted that this hotel has a few trainee managers that seemed to go the extra mile to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay, in particular was Ishodha (not sure about the spelling!) who was especially attentive.  Good luck to him, he has the makings of a fine hotel manager!

We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish, quality stay in this part of Sri Lanka.","Where style, comfort and quality collide","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r1000677427-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Modernist style, beautifully appointed room & grounds. The staff are genuinely helpful & friendly. 

The buffet & room service are great.

We were lucky to get a top floor room in the building not overlooking the pool, in the wing looking to the lake & trees, so were entertained by the monkeys visiting our balcony, along with the squirrels & birds. We could easily see birds including fish eagles & kites. Most of the monkeys run away except a couple of them, so don’t leave food or clothes on the balcony… we were amused that a male knew where to look for food through the window.

There are birdwatching & other tours which we didn’t have time for but wish we had done.

The pool is 70 metres long, & warm, with a bar near it. The gym is very good. 

A ride to Dambulla town is about 15 minutes.

If I had to comment on a negative… the light switches are in very strange places!

The hotel room was lovely overlooking the lake in the garden block. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with a great shower and bath with a view. It was lovely sitting out early evening watching the monkeys playing in the trees,listening to the peacocks and many different birds. I could have stayed there forever with the view. 
The buffet restaurant had lots of choice for both breakfast and evening meal. Lovely to sit outside for both and listen to the wildlife. Loved the different closed areas for starters and dessert which prevents birds flying in to steal the food.
We found the hotel to be both clean and comfortable and staff welcoming and pleasant. 
I would definitely recommend and sadly not enough time to spend enjoying the facilities due to a tight schedule of our tour however we did make use of the wonderful swimming pool which had a lovely view of the grounds.
Unsure if there is any entertainment in the evening as we were shattered and retired early to get ready for another adventure the following day.
Thank you to all the staff for an enjoyable holiday.","A room with a view","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r998170235-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Firstly and most importantly, the hotel is stunning as it suggests from the photographs, but what sets this place apart is the staff, Hasantha and George especially made my stay here amazing as it was my partners birthday and they put on everything amazingly and effortlessly. They go above and beyond in every aspect of your stay you feel like royalty but it is also so effortless for them and always to make your stay as comfortable as it can be. The staff across the whole property are amazing and they all deserve a mention. 

The hotel itself is on stunning grounds, immediately backing onto a stunning beach was lovely to take a stroll down. The rooms offer a view which could be put in a gallery. The pool is a great size and again gives great views. Room is cleaned daily. The massage service and other activities they offer are also top notch. 

There are so many small gestures which don’t go unnoticed from popsicles when it’s really hot, to fresh aloe Vera when you’ve been in the sun a bit too much the previous day and it these things which show the staff across the hotel care. 

Whilst I didn’t get the chefs name, he deserves a huge mention too as the food is honestly some of the best food I have ever had, especially the biryani which I highly recommend. From breakfast to dinner, you couldn’t fault a dish. 

Having stayed in places across Europe, Asia, America, I can easily state you will not receive a better service anywhere, and if there is I am yet to find it. 

The best way to finish this review is with a really big thank you as it’s deserved and i can’t wait to come back!","Amazing stay","2023-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r888241731-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This hotel is breathtaking. The design, service, FOOD and location. 
I stayed in the Musikaya room, on the first floor with sea-facing views/ baths every morning, Also nice small touches like the slippers and open dresser area. The chef is phenomenal, I had a great prawn kottu, avocado salad and amazing breakfast choices. The location is in Thalpe between Unawatuna and Ahangama, what I liked about this is that it was an 8 min tuk tuk ride to the best yoga studio in the south (IMO) Sri Yoha, a fantastic fitness retreat centre; Makahiya fitness and the bustling bars/towns of Unawatuna/Ahangama, while also being in its own serene beachfront location.  Another thing to note is there are many tuk tuks outside the hotel so getting around is not an issue. I WILL return here. Special shout out to Boss Man George :) and Laskshita.

The hotel itself is more like a stunning home (my son said we were 'living like Ronaldo'!) with just a few rooms, all fancing the beautiful beach and ocean.  We were greeted like family and the team could not do enough for us throughout our stay.  Our room was spacious for 4 of us, with a large bathroom.  The breakfasts were amazing (those pancakes!) as was every meal that we had at the hotel.  The pool is freshwater (not always the case) and despite it being a mostly couples hotel, no-one minded our kids enjoying the pool for hours.  The location is great as you are close to lovely beaches at Dallawella (with turtles!) and Unawatuna, as well as the beautiful fort city of Galle a bit further away.  But all within easy reach via tuktuk, which the hotel organised easily for us.  All the staff were polite and friendly, and could not do enough for us as a family.  Special mention to Charith who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and help with every query and question, from restaurant recommendations to lost flip flops!  He made us feel like one of the Sielen Diva family.  A wonderful hotel which we will always remember fondly, and hope to return one day.

It was our first stop in Sri Lanka and the hotel really is a stunning and relaxing location. Everyone that worked there was really friendly and couldn’t do enough for you! A big shout out to Hasanta who managed to work his magic to get us a table at a restaurant in Galle that was full booked which was one of the best meals we had in the country! 

Where they also went above and beyond was when we realised we had left our passport and cash in the safe after we had checked out! 🙈 By that time we had driven 2hrs down the coast so Hasanta reassured us he would keep it in the hotel safe until we returned to the area a week later. It was such a peace of mind and really appreciated! Can’t wait to return again one day and would recommend anyone to book a visit as well!

The electric sockets were fully UK compatible. Two spacious wardrobes. AC and ceiling fan. There was a hairdryer. shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in the bathroom.  
The restaurant was superb. Breakfast was fruit juice, fresh fruits Toast and jams, and then full English. Plenty of fresh coffee. The evening meal was read to us by Madhu the rest manager. The staff were more than happy to help with any requests we had. The water on site was fully drinkable. Each room had a umbrella to use.
The spa had plenty of excellent treatments.dressing gown provided. 
At hilltop villas there was a swimming pool, all pool towels provided.  Daily excursions on AC bus with Jims farm, 
Staff were the most friendly people i have ever met. nothing was to much trouble. 
villa manager, Jesse was very informative about everything, he even changed money for us. We had a tour of the kitchens and a tour of the working farm. 
Every day we had cake and coffee. we had a special visit from a Buddhist Monk who blessed us all. Transfer from Colombo airport 3 hours , the transfer is very smooth.  I cant wait to go back soon. Nikhil and Madhu made this a great holiday along with those whose names i cant even remember.

I stayed there for three nights with two friends after travelling from Mirissa, Ella, and Kandy and it was our favourite accommodation of the whole trip. The staff were very friendly, incredibly kind and helpful - they organised a driver at short notice after our train was cancelled due to strikes, gave us a tour of the plantation, and organised a cooking demonstration.

Its a wonderful place to stay and is in an excellent location for visiting Dambulla and Sigiriya. The farm has a very relaxed atmosphere, is a beautiful place to walk and the pool is also very clean and inviting. The rooms are beautiful, clean and spacious and there are a variety of board games, a pool table and table football.

The restaurant is beautiful. We had two dinners there, one was a four course dinner which was incredible, especially the soup which my friends and I agreed was the best we had ever tasted. On our last night we ordered a Sri Lankan curry expecting one or two dishes. Instead we were served with 12 different curries plus a variety of other sides! it was the best meal we had out of the whole trip.

We used the hotel as a basis for the cultural triangle, but I wouldn't recommend the hotel location for that. The drives to Pollanaruwa, Sigiriya etc are still quite long. But I would definitely recommend to stay at this beautiful place and enjoy nature, the farm and do some nearby activities. We did a farm tour, which was very interesting.

We stayed in the Hilltop Villa alongside the owner, Kevin, who provided us with many a trip in his 1974 Mercedes to dinner and gave us tours of the farm and the nearby village. The villa was beautiful, clean and well-equipped. A special mention to Osana who brightened up our mornings with his lovely smile and trips to breakfast in the farm’s Tuk-Tuk. Jesse, the manager, helped organise a variety of trips and a driver to stay with us. He was also very accommodating when I became ill one day. Himself and Osana made sure I was fed, watered and comfortable - because of this, I made a speedy recovery. 
The farm’s dogs and birds are another perk of staying here - we loved Bingo! 
Dinner was created mainly using the resources on the organic farm and every night it was a surprise. I enjoyed every meal! I also loved the communal aspect as we got to know several families from across the world. 
Overall, I am counting down the seconds until I return. I had a hard time leaving! It was just beautiful. ","A little slice of heaven","2019-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1865780-d2650685-r698934936-Jim_s_Farm_Villas-Matale_Central_Province.html",

The lodges were unassuming in design yet comfortable and spacious inside.
It was a relaxed place to rest after our strenuous climb up the Lion Rock the following day. The highlight for me was the bar pavilion where there were two young musicians performing during weekends.

This was a most leisurely trip for us - 6 friends from Pune, India.. The first stop was Cinnamon Lodge, Habarana. We liked the resort from the word go, due first to it's different styled reception area, instead of a typical hotel, or even a resort, this was different, in the sense it was fully open on the front with a feeling of ancient houses of Maharashtra, India which were called as wadas. every cottage has 2 rooms, one on ground and one above. The rooms are beautiful, they have made a rare combination of privacy and company which is lovely. The lake and the swimming pool is really worth a visit, in the mornings, someone used to play flute which just breezed throughout the resort, giving a very calm feel, without disturbing. Evenings - it was western, party music. The food spread is marvellous with most of Srilankan, Indian, Chinese, Thai and western cuisine on display. The Srilankan food was superb. Mainly the hoppers, milk rice, fish curries, various symbols etc. 
The most remarkable feature was service - service like never experienced, so friendly, so helpful, and always with a smiling face. 
I would especially would like to mention Dinesh, who gave our group a real treat of a service. Our housekeeping person was also very helpful but can't recollect the name right now. 
Overall a great place if you want have a leisurely holiday. especially rewarding if you're a creative person.","Great ambience, food and service at Cinnamon Lodge, Habaranna","2024-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d939424-r971653195-Cinnamon_Lodge_Habarana-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

Greetings from Cinnamon Lodge!

Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback! We’re delighted to hear that your stay in the Satin room made you feel immersed in nature while still enjoying comfort and tranquility. It's always lovely to hear that our gardens, with their lively birdlife and playful monkeys, helped make your experience special.

We’re also glad the pool hit the mark—both for a bit of exercise and some well-deserved relaxation. It’s great to know the space worked so well for reading, resting, and simply unwinding.

We truly appreciate your kind words and hope to welcome you back for another peaceful stay soon.

If you are planning to visit Cinnamon Lodge don’t forget to try their 30+ varieties of home-made ice cream. I should not forget the hoppers made by village amma, that wonderful lady has been working with the hotel for 25+ years. And also, don’t forget to visit their organic farm and butterfly garden and Mr. Chinthaka would be one of the best tour coordinators who can give you tremendous amount of knowledge during the visit.

The staff made sure everything flowed smoothly, from check-in to departure. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with a rustic charm that matched the overall aesthetic of the lodge. I particularly enjoyed the balcony views, where I could spot birds and monkeys in the trees. It felt like being in the middle of a living forest. The buffet spread offered a decent variety, and the dining area was beautifully set, especially in the evenings.

it was a real pleasure to have you here with us for several days. Thank you very much for this detailed review, which gives our future guests some wonderful insights. I will forward the review to Prasad and he will be very happy that you mentioned him. In the end a place can only be as good as the team behind, right?

I am hoping that all the yoga and the EFT sessions with me were a good start into a new period of your life. And for this I am wishing you only the very best.

Take care, keep on tapping, meditating and relaxing in shavasana ;-)!

Elke was very welcoming and friendly and very knowledgeable about yoga and healing therapies. 
The house is beautiful with lovely courtyard in the centre and rooms on top floor all around, most with balconies but some quiet open spaces to sit and read. 
Rooms were comfortable and typical Sri Lankan wooden furniture for beds, wardrobes etc. 
We did Yin, Hatha and Aerial yoga sessions with Elke which are charged additionally and early morning meditation is free. 
Aerial yoga was an exhilarating experience and a must try as Elke is very patient and very safe teacher. 
I also did some EFT - tapping sessions with her which was very helpful. 
The staff are all lovely as they are part of the family and Prasad who took care of all our needs was amazing, so kind and patient. 
Food can be ordered A la Carte or can pay $18 for selected meals and some hot drinks included. 
We had authentic Sri Lankan curries a few nights which were very tasty and delicious. 
It’s a good place to unwind and rest and the options to choose to do the yoga practices and meditation is great.

It was an oasis of calm and beauty, providing the perfect space for relaxation and rejuvenation. After a busy year, I came here to unwind before continuing my travels around Sri Lanka, and it exceeded all my expectations. The peaceful surroundings, impeccable service, and wonderful amenities made it an unforgettable experience.

* Elke answered all of my questions prior to booking so I was very clear on what I was booking and how much it would cost. I did loads to research prior to booking. 
* Elke and her team were incredibly welcoming from the moment I arrived. Their kindness made me feel completely at home.
* The house is stunning, with several balconies that offer breathtaking views of the serene landscape. It even has a charming little library.
* My bedroom was the perfect retreat, featuring a comfortable bed, mosquito net, and a lovely deck where I could enjoy my morning tea while watching monkeys play in the trees.
* I spent many hours by the beautiful pool, swimming at my leisure, surrounded by nature's tranquility.
* A peaceful walk around the area gave me the chance to greet the friendly, smiling locals.
* The food was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. It was served on the verandah, with views of the pool and trees, making every meal feel special. There are no restaurants nearby, but the food here was some of the best I had during my entire trip.
*  I arranged for a local masseuse to visit, and the massage was wonderfully relaxing, adding to the overall rejuvenating experience.
* The house is about 20 minutes by tuk-tuk from Galle Fort, which I visited a couple of times during my 10-day stay.
*  As a beginner, I took part in Elke’s Yin yoga class, and she was incredibly attentive and supportive. The morning meditation was also a peaceful start to each day. There are various packages available for yoga and meditation, or you can simply relax and enjoy the stay.

While Niyagama House was the most expensive place I stayed during my month in Sri Lanka, it was by far the best. 

Overall, I absolutely loved my time at Niyagama House and will definitely make it a priority to return in the future.","A Serene Escape","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r993940264-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The yoga was awesome! We tried the aerial yoga which was great.

Was mir vorher nicht klar war, dass es auch für unsere Gastgeberin das erste Retreat in ihrem neuen großen wunderschönen Raum war. Ich weiß gar nicht, wo ich anfangen kann mit meinem Lob und Teilen, denn an diesem Ort hat einfach alles für mich und uns gestimmt: Vom Empfang der Gastgeberin Elke, über die liebevoll und individuell gestalteten und sehr gepflegten Zimmer (jeden Tag bekommst du wunderschöne frische Blüten im Zimmer arrangiert) über den unfassbar schönen, großzügigen Retreat-Raum, der rundum verglast mit Fenstern, die sich alle öffnen lassen, einen Panoramablick in den Dschungel bietet, bis hin zu entspannenden Pausen am herrlichen Pool. Die einheimische Küche hat uns jeden Tag mit köstlichen Currys verwöhnt, ganz zu schweigen vom Sri Lankanischen Frühstück, das ich absolut lieben gelernt habe. Jeden Morgen beim Frühstück besucht Elke jeden einzelnen Tisch, erkundigt sich, ob etwas fehlt, hört nach, welche Pläne für den Tag anstehen, gibt super wertvolle Tipps, arrangiert Fahrten, erfüllt Sonderwünsche und ist einfach immer für alles ansprechbar. Das Gleiche gilt für ihr super professionelles und gleichzeitig herzliches Team. Hier werden Wünsche erfüllt, bevor du sie überhaupt ausgesprochen hast. Ganz gleich, ob du hier ein Retreat veranstalten willst, an einem der Angebote vor Ort teilnehmen magst oder einfach nur eine Zeit der Entspannung suchst: Niyagama House und Elke sind auf allen Ebenen eine hundertprozentige Empfehlung!","Niyagama House: Außergewöhnliches Retreat- und Entspannungs-Highlight im Süden Sri Lankas","2024-11","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r982336714-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We were thrilled to return for the fourth time. Practicing yoga with Elke is always a highlight—she has an extensive knowledge of yoga and leads inspiring classes, but what truly sets her apart is her sweetness, humility, and wonderful sense of humor. Elke is the perfect hostess.
The shalas are the most beautiful spaces we've ever practiced in, and the house, with its stunning architecture, is impeccably clean. The pool and pool area are top-notch, and the food is absolutely delicious. A walk through the lush garden, surrounded by a variety of plants, birds, and monkeys, only adds to the sense of tranquility.
Niyagama House is the ideal place to find peace of mind, calm, and balance.

The hotel is set a little away from the main road and offers a peaceful retreat.  The staff are helpful and always have a smile on their face.  
Our room was luxurious with a great view of the lake, garden and pool.  Although we didn’t use the pool, it looked very inviting.
There are indoor and outdoor bars and a large open restaurant adjacent to and opening onto the garden.  There is an A La Carte or buffet option: both offering delicious food and a variety of options.
This is a hotel where large tour groups may use, but the space is plentiful.  We found this not to be off-putting.

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Jetwing Lake! We're thrilled to hear that you had such a fantastic stay, from the warm and welcoming greeting to the stunning room upgrade. It's always great to know that the little touches, like the politeness of the staff and the gorgeous view from your balcony, helped make your time even more special.

We're also glad you enjoyed the food, especially the Sri Lankan dishes and the Egg Hoppers! The atmosphere with the fire torches really adds to the experience, and it's great to know that both your dining experiences and the excursions, like the visit to Sigiriya Rock and the safari at Minneriya National Park, were memorable.

Your comments on the cleanliness, eco-friendly initiatives, and the professionalism of the staff truly reflect the essence of what Jetwing Lake aims to provide. We’re so happy you had the chance to appreciate both the service and the sustainable practices. We hope you’ll return to one of the Jetwing hotels for more amazing experiences, and we’re delighted that you had such a great time overall.

Thank you again for the thoughtful review, and we wish you many more unforgettable adventures!

On arrival we had the politest greeting with drinks & snacks, received a tour of the hotel and was shown to our room - a complimentary upgrade to the super deluxe.  When the young lady asked if it was ok to come into the room and then took her shoes off, we knew we were on holiday and we knew this hotel, and Sri Lanka in general, was going to be epic. 

After getting our head around the size of the room, the gorgeous view from our balcony over the pool & lake, the huge bathroom and the secret cupboard (I'll leave that as a surprise) we headed for a wander around the lake and to the bar for a celebratory drink where we were met with the same high level of service from the bar staff. One drink quickly turned into three or four.

Dinner time was fantastic and we dived into anything & everything Sri Lankan - all of it tasted so good.  We were half board for info and the food was buffet style for us. They lit fire torches outside adding to the atmosphere. Safe to say we slept well on night one ready for our first excursion of the holiday the next day.

Jetwing Lake is perfectly located for Sigiriya Rock which we went to the following morning. We then had a few hours relaxing by the amazing pool watching the birdlife, and then in the  afternoon we had our first safari close by at Minneriya National Park.

Our second evening and the following breakfast was just good as the first. During this breakfast we also ventured into the world of Egg Hoppers.  You have to try them!  The lady cooking the Egg Hoppers deserves a shout out for her friendliness, and cooking skills of course. 

The setting is beautiful and unlike anywhere we had stayed before and the level of cleaniness all around the hotel & gardens is definitely worth mentioning. Our room was spotlessly cleaned during our stay. Every member of staff we spoke to was polite & friendly & professional, from cleaners & gardeners to reception & restaurant staff. The sustainability & eco side of the hotel is also worth mentioning and it was nice to stay somewhere which has a real commitment to it.  Most of it you don't see but the little things, like water & bathroom condiments being refilled in glass bottles, I'm sure makes a noticeable difference.

From Jetwing Lake we went on to stay at Jewtwing St Andrews and Jetwing Yala later in the holiday and each of these hotels, although both different in style, was equally as good. I would highly recommend staying at any of these Jetwing hotels.","A great start to the best holiday ever!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r995263288-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Used by lots of tour groups that they handle well and we never queued at all.  
Overall, smart, clean and functional hotel with attentive, smiling staff everywhere. 
One tip is to take an early evening cycle on their free bikes or walk with a camera around the lake. The bird life is amazing.

The bed itself was supportive yet yielding. The room had a big bath as well as a separate shower. Perfect.
The food was varied, well-presented and tasty. The morning coffee was too weak for us, but they brought our own pot with a stronger brew.
We took a 6am bird walk with a local guide which was amazing. The lakeside is abundant with birds of many kinds.
All staff were nice except the one who told me wouldn't be interested in the gym because I have a big belly. He was rude.

We are thrilled that every detail, from service to food and welcoming smiles, made your stay unforgettable. We eagerly await your return next year to your home away from home!

This was our second visit, and everything was just as warm, welcoming, and wonderful as we remembered.

From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us like family. A special shout-out goes to one of the team member at the main restaurant – I believe his name was  saranga  – who went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. His kindness and attentiveness truly stood out.

What touched us the most was their honesty and thoughtfulness. We had accidentally left behind an earring, and to our surprise, the team reached out to let us know and ensured it was returned to us. That kind of genuine care is rare to find and speaks volumes about their hospitality and professionalism.

Every detail – from the service to the food, to the welcoming smiles – made our stay unforgettable. Cinnamon Harbour truly feels like a home away from home. We’re already looking forward to coming back again next year!  
Specially  f/b service team 2 girls a one is bit smaller and another a white girl always clam  I forgot there and saranga I think if I’m not wrong the name they are 2nd family members to us

Thank you for choosing Cinnamon Lodge Habarana during your recent trip to Sri Lanka and for taking the time to share such a detailed review. We're truly delighted to hear that you loved our location, appreciating its setting within a nature reserve, the peaceful walks around the lakes, and the wildlife encounters with monitor lizards.

It's wonderful to know you found your deluxe room great, with its colonial feel, lovely colours, comfortable bed, and effective air-conditioning. We're also glad you enjoyed the good shower in your bathroom, despite it being a little dated. We're particularly pleased to hear that our pool was the best of the Cinnamon properties you experienced and that you had no trouble with sunbeds.

We sincerely appreciate your candid feedback regarding the dining experience. We understand that the buffet style may not suit all guests, and we regret that our à la carte option didn't feel like a comfortable alternative for you as a couple. Your comments about the bar service, the comfort of the seats, and the visible broken concrete in the bar area are also very valuable. Please be assured that we've taken note of these points for our ongoing improvements, as we continuously strive to enhance our guest experience.

Despite these points, we're very happy that you still found the overall look of the place great, especially our open-plan and outdoor reception area, and that you had a lovely stay overall.

We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Cinnamon Lodge Habarana in the future, providing an even more seamless and enjoyable experience.

Situated in the middle of a nature reserve and we did walk round the hotel grounds, next to lakes which was very peaceful.  We stayed in a delux-room, top of one of the chalets and the bedroom itself was great. Colonial feel, lovely colours, comfortable bed and air-con worked, a 5 minute walk from the main restaurant and bar, a walk where we did occasionally meet some wildlife in the form of the ubiquitous monitor lizards which was fun. Good shower in bathroom which was a little dated, but totally fine.  It’s a big place & caters for large tour company tours so as a couple we weren’t too interested in the large buffet style option for dinner. They don’t really cater for anything else; an a-la-carte option in a separate room/area was available, but we would have been eating on our own and this felt a bit ""second class citizen"" so we went out to nearby restaurants which suited us much better. Pool was the best of the ones we experienced at Cinnamons and we had no trouble getting a sun-bed. Bar service was a bit slow, the seats quite uncomfortable without cushions, and the bar area had a fair bit of broken concrete visible which spoiled the look a little. Still, the overall look of the place is great and we loved the open plan & outside reception area.   One annoying point was the inconsistency of getting a glass of water at breakfast, some gave you one without question, others charged you for a bottle of water which is pretty annoying at breakfast. Not sure why it was so hit and miss for the water. Anyway, lovely place to stay overall.","Beautiful lodge-style accomonation on a nature reserve","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d939424-r1010587292-Cinnamon_Lodge_Habarana-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

After doing lots of research about a place to stay, I decided on this guesthouse as it fulfilled my requirements - beautiful clean accommodation, peaceful environment, delicious food, highly rated yoga classes, great service. After my time here, I can say that it was even better than anticipated.

This guesthouse on a tea plantation is a little paradise. In the mornings I would drink my cup of coffee on the balcony while listening to and watching the incredible surrounding nature - monkeys climbing on the trees and birds chirping.

The hotel is beautifully constructed and the family who runs it maintains it meticulously. The food in the restaurant is on par with the best as the chef is very skilled. Everybody who works here is friendly and treats you very well.

Hatha, aerial and yin yoga is all offered here. Elke, the owner and yoga instructor, is a superb teacher who can adjust to all skill levels and quickly helped me improve my skills.

Galle Fort is a fun 20 minutes Tuk Tuk ride away. I was considering staying there for a couple of days, but I'm glad I didn't as the Sri Lankan heat is more unbearable in town. Visiting Galle Fort for a few hours was enough and I was glad to return to the Niyagama House pool afterwards which is surrounded by nature.

Overall, I highly recommend Niyagama House - it is an upscale hotel without the upscale price tag. Contact the hotel directly for the best price. This unique and special guesthouse is also great for long term stays.","Unique and special guesthouse","2024-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r946261709-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you so much for your incredibly detailed and positive review of your recent stay at Cinnamon Lodge Habarana!

We're delighted to hear that despite the drive from Colombo, you found our location to be a perfect hub for exploring the ancient capitals, Sigiriya, and the surrounding nature parks. It truly is an ideal base for discovery.

It's wonderful to know that our Deluxe Suite perfectly accommodated your party of four with its spacious two floors and common areas, and that you enjoyed the balconies. We are especially thrilled that the dedicated butler service was a pleasant surprise and that Asanka made your stay so comfortable and memorable. We'll be sure to pass on your high praise to him directly for being so helpful and always a step ahead!

We're also pleased that you loved how our hotel blends seamlessly with nature, offering you the chance to spot wildlife and enjoy tranquil strolls around the lake. It's a key part of the unique experience we offer.

Your compliments on our delicious breakfasts and dinners, with their large variety of local and continental options, are much appreciated. We're also glad you found our staff friendly and very attentive, and that our currency exchange service was convenient for you.

Thank you for your fantastic feedback following your recent stay with us, accommodating a French incentive group of 106 persons for two nights. It's truly rewarding to hear that ""everything was perfect there as usual"" and that you found our landscaping and maintenance to be consistently top-notch, with the beautiful surroundings scoring at least a 7 out of 10 for you.

We truly appreciate your kind words about our services across all aspects. We've also carefully noted your observations regarding the need for room renovations and the suggestion to improve the quality of food compared to your previous stays. Please be assured that these are crucial insights, and we are actively looking into these areas to ensure we continuously uphold and enhance the Cinnamon Brand's quality standards.

We are delighted that, overall, you had ""nothing to grumble"" about! We value your continued patronage and your candid comments, which are vital for our ongoing improvement.

We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you and future groups back to Cinnamon Lodge Habarana very soon.

Warm regards,

Purchase alcohol in duty free on arrival ",,,,,,,,,,,,,"From the moment my husband and I arrived we felt like we were in a little piece of paradise. The place is so calm and peaceful and we were exceptionally lucky to be the only guests here for a couple of days. We stayed for a total of 4 nights. We really appreciated the wet towel and fresh coconut on arrival. We were very kindly upgraded to a balcony room which I enjoyed drinking a cup of tea on each morning and listening/watching the monkeys and the birds. The swimming pool is huge and big enough for exercising in. The food here was very tasty. We particularly enjoyed trying a new Sri lankan dish each morning for breakfast. Janika (waiter) was particularly attentive to all of our needs without being intrusive. The staff in general at Niyagama House are gentle and friendly. Elke is a beautiful soul who has an air of calmness and kindness about her. She has designed a beautiful property that has western comforts yet in the middle of a tea plantation in Sri Lanka with all the beauty of nature this brings. We also enjoyed trying a couple of yoga classes with Elke. She is an excellent teacher and was able to find a style that my husband and I as beginners were comfortable with. I enjoyed these classes so much that I feel inspired to begin regular classes back at home. During our time at Niyagama House we both tried Ayurvedic massages. I had a 60 minute massage and my husband a 90minute massage. He enjoyed his massage so much that he had a second one two days later. Niyagama House was part of our honeymoon stay and the staff went above and beyond to make this extra special for us with flowers on our bed and dinner table each evening. The bedroom itself is big and spacious with an excellent mosquito net so we did not have any bug bites during the night. Everything was very clean. We really appreciated that the bed was prepared for sleeping each night with beautiful flowers whilst we went for dinner. 
My husband and I have just returned from our time in Niyagama House. We were very sad to leave but feel very relaxed and that our stresses have melted away after 4 wonderful nights. I can't recommend this place enough. We have stayed in resorts in Maldives, Dubai, Vietnam, Mexico amongst others and Niyagama House tops the list of being the best value, most beautiful location and overall the most excellent experience! We are already thinking about our return visit. Thank you so much Elke and your team for making our honeymoon stay so special. 

Top tips 
Stay for at least 3 nights to enjoy the full experience. 
Book a balcony room if available to experience drinking tea and watching the monkeys in the morning. If no room is available however there is a beautiful shared balcony space you can use. 
My husband and I don't eat much seafood but it looked tasty! We can highly recommend the vegetable curries. 
If you have enough time I recommend a trip to Galle Fort for dinner, walk and watch the sunset with an ice-cream. Also be sure to visit Barefoot store for beautiful souvenirs at a very good price. Aqua Pizzeria is nice if you are looking for a cheaper option and a bit of a change in cuisine. 
If you drink alcohol, purchase this at DutyFree on arrival. You can also prebook to collect this on arrival. 
Although more expensive that independently booking an uber/taxi we recommend the transfer service to the airport. The driver has a very comfortable air-conditioned van with cushions and cold water which meant we could rest and not be sweaty arriving at the airport. 
If you book an Ayurvedic massage be aware that this a more gentle massage compared to Swedish styles but they are extremely relaxing. My husband fell asleep both times. 
Don't be afraid to try a yoga session. Elke is an excellent teacher and I am confident she can cater to all abilities. You won't feel awkward/uncomfortable in her presence as there is no judgement. 
There are many books available to read in the library. You can 'swap' your book if you run out of reading materials. 
You are in a tea plantation so there are some insects. Be sure to bring an environmentally friendly mosquito repellent e.g. citronella with you. 
No need to bring shampoo etc with you as luxurious shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body lotion is provided in beautiful ceramic pots in the bathroom. These were some of the nicest toiletries I've had even in comparison to larger resorts in Maldives and Dubai.","Beautiful honeymoon stay in secluded paradise","2022-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r829908269-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The Yoga- Room has a wonderful view to the garden with the sound of (morning) birds- like in a fairtale. Elke is amazing. She helped us with all our wishes and concerns during our stay.

The whole place is made with love and we instantly felt good there and never wanted to leave. 
We will definitely come again – for Yoga, good food and to calm down and let the good vibes touching our souls.","Our personal highlight in Sri Lanka","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r747088594-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Everything here really exceeded our expectations, so we extended our stay.

The estate is situated a bit up surrounded by a tea plantation and with lovely gardens surrounding the house. It's very quiet and peaceful.
You really get a nice feeling when living surrounded by nature, jungle and can watch animals like lovely birds and monkeys etc
The house is beautiful and our room was spacious and very comfortable, so well planned in every detail. We had an own balcony, but even if you don't have there are some really nice ones for everybody to use.
Lovely pool and pool area.
The staff is very welcoming and helpful, always with a smile. The food is lovely.
Elke, the owner is a great host, really checking that all is great, also helped out with our planning for the visit, taxi etc.

We had really great Hatha YOGA classes every morning and in addition we joined some nice Yin and meditation classes in the evening. Elke is an amazing yoga teacher! She is experienced and checking on each student, making everyone feel safe and comfortable. Always with warmth and a smile.

Can't really don't find anything to improve right now, so If you want to recharge and relax this piece of heaven is the right place to be!!

Der er kun 5 værelser og derfor er lille intimt sted der primært henvender sig til par/venner der rejser uden børn. 
Vi boede der er uge og nød hver dag (indtil der tjekkede gæster ind med børn)
Personalet gør rigtig meget for at imødekomme ønsker til mad mv. De er meget høflige og hjælpsomme. Kokken laver fantastisk mad så det er ikke nødvendigt at forlade matriklen hvis man ikke ønsker det. 
Der serveres afternoon tea hver eftermiddag. Hyggelig “gimmick” som gør at gæsterne lige samles og får mulighed for at tale sammen eller bare nyde lidt lækkert til ganen og udsigten udover vandet. 
Fin mindre pool som rengøres hver dag. 
Der kan ikke bade lige udenfor villaen grundet voldsomme bølger. Ønsker man at bade ved stranden skal man lidt op ad stranden fra villaen. 
Villaen ligger i udkanten af Hikkaduwa. Der er 15-20 minutters gang op til der hvor butikker og restauranter ligger som perler på en snor.

If you're a details person read on............

Ideally I wouldn't write this review, through through pure selfishness so that when I want to book again there is availability! 
Villa Saffron is the ONLY place I have EVER wanted to return to, and we have travelled quite extensively over the years.

Sunil is one of the most thoughtful people and is keen to ensure your stay is perfect, he caters for all your needs, and is able to offer advice for places to go and see. Kason is also a key member of the team who is also very helpful, either one is available at the property 24 hours a day so you feel confident you are in safe hands. All the team ensure the Villa is spotless and everything is available for you, they go about their work quietly without disturbance in their polite and charming manner.

The beach is glorious, it is swept each day by properties and restaurants to ensure it is maintained and free of any debris (though there is little anyhow). 
To the left, you will find a long, peaceful walk with scatterings of bars, go to Catamaran - run by Sunil (a different Sunil to Villa Saffron) and his family.  
To the right there are lots of bars and restaurants, a short walk along you will find surfers racing the waves and places you can stop and watch. 
There are fishing boats which go out at night and if you are lucky you may find them pulling their catch in as you are eating breakfast, it was exhausting just watching them!

We stayed in the Saffron Suite which was stunning, and huge. The balcony offered a glimpse of the sunset and provided some much needed shade at the end of the day. Outside the 2 rooms upstairs there is a seating area inside and another on the balcony, these can be used by other guests but as there are just 5 rooms at this property and there are seating areas downstairs there is so much space we found we were able to be on our own most of the time.","Stop looking and get booking if you want luxury, peace and tranquillity - before its too late.","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r996801314-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Only downside was that in one room the air conditioning did not cool enough, luckily there was also a ceiling fan.","Great accomodation at the sea.","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r963882535-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Visiting at the start of the off-season, we were delighted to find that we practically had the entire villa to ourselves, providing an intimate and exclusive experience.

The villa's staff were outstanding; their attention to detail and genuine care ensured our stay was comfortable and memorable. The facilities at the villa were first-class—everything was clean and well-maintained, from the spacious interiors of the rooms, huge bathrooms, to the expansive balcony offering plenty of privacy. The ambiance was perfect for relaxation and unwinding.

One of the highlights was the food prepared on-site; it was simply first-class, rivaling top restaurants in flavor and presentation. Having the ability to walk straight out to the ocean and enjoy a clean, serene beach was the cherry on top of our relaxing stay.

While the villa isn't close to major shopping areas, it didn't detract from our experience as the tranquility and beauty of the location were exactly what we needed after days of travel and sightseeing. Villa Saffron is the perfect place to recharge, making it an ideal retreat for adults looking for a peaceful getaway.

We highly recommend Villa Saffron Hikkaduwa and are already looking forward to our next visit.

Architecturally designed with beautiful touches.  It is definitely a private home not a hotel kind of place, which is exactly what we wanted. We had the largest room there (Saffron) up on the first floor with a huge external balcony too, overlooking the pool/ocean. All the other rooms looked lovely too, all with there own special features. We ate well, sitting on the terrace enjoying the delicious food and relative calm. The grounds were very well looked after and it was a lovely place to sit and chill by the pool. The surf was a short walk up the beach, the main reason for staying in that area, and did not disappoint. The non-surfer was equally happy walking on the beach and just enjoying Villa Saffron! Sunil and his team were incredible…..could not fault their attention to detail and were always available, yet very discreet, should anything be needed.

Tucked away from the bustling road, this quiet retreat provided the perfect escape. The highlight was undoubtedly the outstanding staff, with Manager Surin leading the way in ensuring a memorable experience.

The location strikes a perfect balance—serene and peaceful, yet just a swift 5-minute journey to the vibrant restaurant and shopping hub. The villa’s limited size, with only 5 rooms, lends an intimate atmosphere that adds to the charm.

A piece of advice: book the rooms on 1st floor to enjoy added privacy. The ground floor lacks the seclusion found in the upper levels.

Хиккадува - маленькая деревенька, одна улица, на побережье, немного отелей, гестхаусы, магазинчики, кафешки. Эта вилла - уютный большой дом, в котором 5 комнат - 5 номеров. Отношение персонала - наивнимательнейшее, помощь во всем. Это не отель, но у вас уберутся в номере, поменяют полотенца (зубные щетки и тапочки рекомендуем взять свои), покормят в удобное для вас время завтраком, обедом, ужином, принесут сладкий комплимент в 5 вечера с чаем/кофе. Очень приличный уровень питания - прекрасный шеф, который делает отличное домашнее кокосовое мороженное и восхитительные овощи в темпуре, равиоли с тыквой или рыбу в белом соусе. Вашему маленькому привереде будут подбирать рацион и терпеливо готовить на разные лады картошку или рис (наш 7-летний молодой человек мало что ест, но приехал домой весьма упитанным)) , отдельные слова благодарности - Sunil Dissanayake. Не было ничего, что бы мы попросили и не получили. Благодаря Санилу гость чувствует себя как дома. Спасибо от всей нашей семьи! Пляж напротив виллы прекрасен, но вход в океан каменистый и мы были в сезон больших волн. Купаться не реально. Но в 5 минутах езды на тук-туке хороший пляж (turtle beach), приплывают огромные морские черепахи. На пляже можно расположиться «диким» способом на полотенце под пальмами (осторожнее, кокосы)) либо в отеле на пляже - хорошая инфраструктура (шезлонги, полотенца, бассейн, бар, можно взять обеды шведский стол). Местные жители очень приветливые и доброжелательные, отдых прошел на отлично.","Прекрасно отдохнули всей семьей","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r919072496-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

They have to go and buy ingredients for what you order from the menu so you have to order your dinner in the morning. The food was well executed but not exactly plated or anything. It is a very good option for families. If it is raining you have to leave the main dining area as they are no screens in case the rain beats in. The rooms are large and the four poster beds are soft and comfortable. The rain shower in the upper floor is run by a pressure pump so if the power fails you have to use the hand shower.

It is a family friendly resort, and there were guests of the age of 12, and under, who really enjoyed the pool. All requests were promptly obliged by Sunil and his team. The place has a decent beach, which was very clean as well! 

All the staff - restaurant and the room maintenance were very good. And the food... was amazing! Starting from the authentic rice and curry dishes for lunch, to the other traditional food - string hoppers, coconut roti, kola kenda and the fresh fruit platters for breakfast. They serve tasty cakes like pineapple upside down, at tea time as an accompaniment to tea and/or coffee.
The chef was great and came out of the kitchen to check with us if everything was alright. 

We would highly recommend this place!","A family friendly villa in Hikkaduwa!","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r900227358-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

From start to finish the team treated us like kings. The food is incredible, the care that is taken in preparing the meals is something special and the team have a strong commitment to sourcing all ingredients naturally and locally. The accommodation was perfect; glamping in the jungle with nature on your doorstep but still with those home comforts vibe, you can really see how much thought has gone into this set up. 
As for the safaris JUST WOW, hands down the best experience we have ever had! Nicky our ranger was so knowledgable about both the park and the wildlife and the jeep team really go all out to make sure you see as much as you possibly can. Our only regret - not booking a 3rd safari, we saw so much on our dusk and dawn safaris and had the best time but left with major safari blues and a desperate want to do it all again. 
Big big love and thank you to Ruwan, Nicky and the whole team for making our experience, fun, authentic and so much more than we expected. Additional temple visit and cooking class just created the perfect memories for us. A team who are so passionate about making your stay incredible.

Earl, unser Guide während allen Safaris hat sich so super gekümmert und sich bei jeder Sichtung die wir gemacht haben mit uns gefreut. Er konnte uns unglaublich viel über die Tiere und den Park erzählen, was es natürlich noch interessanter macht. Auch die Autos und der Fahrer sind spitze.

However, my feelings about our stay are mixed. While the camp’s facilities, service, and the safari experience itself were exceptional, our visit was marred by poor organization (by our tour operator - Aitken Spence), and a lack of proactive solutions to enhance the experience (by the staff of Camp Leopard).

We initially booked two nights, expecting to arrive on October 30th, have dinner, and enjoy an early night in preparation for the 6 a.m. safari the next day. The morning safari was spectacular, lasting four hours and offering incredible sightings, including a leopard—an unforgettable moment, especially for my husband on his first-ever safari. However, the remainder of our day on October 31st was left unstructured. When we asked about additional activities, the only suggestion was to “read a book.”

This response was particularly frustrating because there were missed opportunities for the staff to go the extra mile. They could have coordinated with neighboring camps or tour operators to secure an afternoon safari or suggested other nearby activities to make the most of our time. Disappointed with the lack of options, we decided to shorten our stay and move on to Galle.

Despite this setback, Camp Leopard has many strengths. The setting is serene, with a well-kept camp that blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings. The bonfire arranged on our first night was a thoughtful touch, allowing us to enjoy a delicious meal free from the company of mosquitoes and other bugs. The staff were friendly, the food was well-prepared and beautifully presented, and the safari arrangement was seamless.

I believe Camp Leopard can offer an extraordinary experience, especially for those planning their visit independently. With better integration of activities and a more proactive approach from the staff, this place could truly shine as a must-visit destination in Yala.","A Beautiful Camp with Room for Better Coordination","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1188994-d7595081-r982359967-Camp_Leopard_Yala_Safari_Glamping-Kataragama_Uva_Province.html",

The people at Camp Leopard really care for the animals and environment.  We were so impressed.
They are connected to other drivers so when there is a sighting they get a call and we head straight there.
Such a great experience.  Will definitely be back.

The company you choose makes all the difference. We had a guide and driver and sometimes another person. Would join us to spot. A lot of other safaris were just a driver.  A driver can't drive and spot very well alone.

We had booked a full day safari in Yala and two nights at Camp Leopard.

How Ruwan and his team took care of us was an incredible experience - even in the context of the entire stay for holidays in Sri Lanka. 
His extraordinary openness, cordiality, warmth and care accompanied us from the first minutes of meeting. When we came to Camp Leopard, we were mainly focused on a safari adventure. However, Ruwan suggested that we also take a walk around the area and a trip to the nearby Kataragama temple, one of the most significant in the whole of Sri Lanka. It was a wonderful spiritual experience for us to be able to watch and participate in the ceremony.

Ruwan's stories about Sri Lankan culture and its history were so interesting, we felt that we had unexpectedly received such a beautiful lesson in the history of Sri Lanka, which will remain in our memories forever. It was something amazing! Thank you very much Ruwan for heart you gave us during that afternoon with us. We feel very grateful and can't wait to meet you again at Camp Leopard!

The next day we went on a full day safari to Yala, which was also an exceptional experience! Being able to watch the rhythm of wild animals from sunrise to sunset is an experience worth every penny. Our guide was the fantastic Ruwan (a different person than Ruwan at Camp Leopard), who has several years of experience in national parks. His incredible intuition, focus, attentiveness and knowledge meant that we always knew where to go in search of a leopard (seen 4 times!!), elephants, bears, crocodiles or other species of amazing wild animals. We also had a fantastic driver who could ""sneak"" so as not to scare the animals - or drive fast and dynamically to the place where they were at the time! What an adventure!!!
During the safari we had fantastic meals prepared, both breakfast, lunch and coffee and cake tasted like from the best restaurant - with the most amazing view (e.g. of bathing wild animals!).

Additional aspects that affect the uniqueness of this place:

- excellent Sri Lankan cuisine!!! The chef cooks with passion and a great sense of taste! (Although if someone prefers European, they will probably be satisfied too - we ordered traditional cuisine all the time).

- all dishes - both in the camp and on safari - are served on ecological tableware (BRAVO!!!)! Zero plastic - this is Camp Leopard's policy

- wonderful, comfortable tents! Air-conditioned, very comfortable mattresses in the beds, mosquito nets, warm shower, toilet. Wow!!!

- respect for animals! There are 5 dogs in the camp, each of them is vaccinated, wears a collar with a name. Each of them was taken in after difficult experiences: the first is blind in one eye, the second has had a paw operation, the third was saved after being bitten, etc.
I must admit that this attitude moves me a lot, especially in Sri Lanka. A wonderful idea!

- roasting marshmallows in a bonfire (our 8-year-old was delighted!!!) and a unique atmosphere during every meal.

At the end, we said goodbye to the entire Camp team and felt like we were leaving our family. 
Ruwan! We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything you gave us during our meeting! You create an absolutely unique place - we are already planning to return for another safari with you ❤️. 
I also know that no matter how much I write, it will not do justice to what we experienced. Simply put - we recommend Camp Leopard to everyone - it is an experience that will stay with you forever!","Unique experience!!!!

Their safari is a bit more expensive than the ones you will find elsewhere, but you pay for what you get. The safari guide did not get out of the park until i saw a leopard, and the driver was in contact with all other drivers to make sure we did not miss any sightings.
Camp Leopard’s staff will gladly talk to you of you feel like chatting, they will answer your questions about how life is in Sri Lanka, and let you into how it is like to live and grow up here.
Cherry on top was the evening Puja in Kataragama: the guys accompanied us to assist to the rituals and explained to us what was happening, making us feel not as outsiders disturbing, but rather like we were taking part in the ceremony.

Super comfy beds and definitely the glamping vibe! The shower even had hot water which was lovely. The tents even have AC! You are out in the bush so expect bugs etc but you have a bell that you can ring if you need a hand getting anything out of the tent.
Special mention to Nicky who was so lovely, friendly and welcoming! A true asset to the Camp Leopard team. The food was amazing and our three course dinner by the camp fire was just the perfect end to our evening.
Both safaris were amazing and we saw so much wildlife and even two leopards which was incredible! Our driver was great and our guide was amazing, so friendly and very informative, with amazing eyesight!

Gorgeous glamping tents, incredible, fresh, full of flavour, beautifully presented cuisine which catered to all diets. Loved our bonfire night! We went on two wonderful animal packed safari's, a morning and an afternoon, as well as two guided trail walks. What an experience! Our ranger Shermal was so knowledgeable and friendly, a great asset to the team. My final compliment, they are eco-friendly. I will be back!

In that time we did a dusk and dawn Safari, and the experience was INCREDIBLE!

Everything from the accomodation, the staff, the food, the safari to the camp’s dogs was amazing!

We arrived outside of the camp grounds and were greeted by Chathu, our safari guide and wildlife expert. Chathu is a positive person with a great sense of humour. She made us feel very welcome before the three of us hopped in the back of the truck to be taken to Camp Leopard.

When we arrived, we were greeted by the rest of the Camp Leopard team, Tharaka, Milhara, Laiiya, and Handa. Along with the camp’s friendly canines. 

The accomodation is very nice, but be mindful you don’t leave any food in your bags. Unless you want thieves in the form of squirrels helping themselves to your items. Apparently they’re a fan of coffee sachets, as my partner found out 😂. However, we were warned.

The safari itself is one of our best experiences from our time in Sri Lanka. But please note, it is luck on the day as to what animals you’ll see. You’re dealing with wildlife and it’s always a roll of the dice where that’s concerned. With that said, during our two safaris, we were blessed to see the big 5 (leopard, wild bore, water buffalo, sloth bear and elephants).

The food that the camp provides is delicious. We were treated to a traditional Sri Lankan lunch and dinner during our stay, both times we were given more food than we could consume. After the dinner we had s’mores over a camp fire and good conversations with fellow guests at the camp.

The experience with camp leopard is one we can’t recommend enough. And we consider it a must if you’re visiting Yala National Park. ","A Must In Sri Lanka!

It is amazing to be in the wild at sunrise, hear the sounds and the soak in the scents of the woods when all awakes. We saw many birds, millions of butterflies, even stole a glimpse of young female leopard moving past a heard of water buffaloes - no reaction on either side - the leopard slipped in the bushes while the buffaloes kept on munching grass. We saw jackals, deer, rabbits, monkeys, lizards and a very lazy crocodile. And all of this before breakfast. Just regular sandwiches and coffee, but with an incredible view. And then we ran into elephants - a shy young elephant who was “hiding” behind a tree - not successfully, and then Raja - a really big mature elephant who walked in the middle of the road and simply stopped all traffic. He came very close - we could touch his head, but we didn’t, because your are not allowed to.

The location is a short drive from Yala but also right next to a national park, so you feel fully immersed in wildlife - expect bugs, frogs, monkeys and an occasional snake. Camp is very homely, with very good amenities for glamping (generally clean, hot water, flushing loo). We loved the little touches - fresh flowers, locally made shampoo and the camp is especially beautiful when lit up at night.

Onsite the staff were kind, attentive and flexible to our needs, creating a very welcoming and familial atmosphere. Food was amazing fresh sri lankan cuision. The evening meals were superb - four courses plus smores served by candlelight outside by a bonfire. Only feedback is that there way too much food for two of us!

The safaris were incredible. We went to block 1 and 5 - would strongly recommend block 5 for a less commercial, more jungle experience. Our guide was extremely knowledgable and shared great stories about the wildlife and local culture. The team's passion for sustainable conservation shone through and with their expertise we saw four leopards, elephants, tropical birds and eagles and much more .

We had lunch by a river, where we could swim and cool off before tracking leopards in the evening. I have to be honest that we didn’t actually see a leopard (which is apparently a rare occurrence), but the whole experience was still worthwhile. 

Marc is incredibly knowledgeable about the flora and fauna of the region, and if you ask, he’ll also get you up to date with some of the history in the region. Marc happily accommodated me as a solo traveller, without the massive surcharge that can often mean. 

The camp itself is well set up, with various areas for relaxing, including a dining room, lounge and outdoor picnic table. Each “tent” also has a small patio at front. The food was amazing and the atmosphere in the camp lovely.

I personally loved the mirrors in the lobby washroom. Lobby washrooms were super clean. We met a very nice gentleman at the lounge Mr. Asela and he was very friendly and polite. He assist us with the rooms and the rooms were super clean and spacious. Specially we need that as we have 2 kids who love to play on the floor 🤩. We enjoyed our evening by the rooftop pool and the jacuzzi…. And it was very relaxing. I must mention the restaurant staff was very helpful and the breakfast buffet was absolutely fantastic… we enjoyed all the Sri Lankan items in one corner.

Everyone was very helpful and humble who always gave respect when we used their services. The people at reception were always kind,  the waiters at the restaurant too and the security were always there to help, There was one day where we had many people over for dinner and the waiters made the table really well and extended their closing hours so we could enjoy our night. 

The only thing I’d change about the hotel is to add some privacy in the bedroom’s bathrooms as there are gaps in between the doors in the toilet, which doesn’t make people feel comfortable to use. Furthermore, if the windows could be covered more to block people from seeing from the bedroom and a proper door instead of the door with gaps would be beneficial too.","The Amazing NH Collection Colombo!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d11953119-r1010703321-Nh_Collection_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",
