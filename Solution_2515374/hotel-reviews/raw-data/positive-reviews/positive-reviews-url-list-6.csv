Rooms are spacious, clean, and tastefully furnished. I had a sea-facing balcony which was perfect for enjoying the early mornings and sunsets. Housekeeping was prompt and professional throughout my stay.

The service stood out—staff were warm, courteous, and genuinely attentive. From check-in to departure, everything was handled with care and professionalism.

The food was excellent. The breakfast buffet had great variety, and the quality of ingredients was high. I also enjoyed dining in the other on-site restaurants, which offered both Sri Lankan and international dishes.

The pool area was peaceful, clean, and well-managed. I also visited the spa, which offered a very relaxing and well-executed treatment.

Despite visiting during the off-season, the resort operated smoothly, with no compromise on service or amenities.

Overall: A beautiful, well-run property that delivers on comfort, service, and location.

Our recent stay at Cape Weligama was truly something special. After reaching out directly to the Resplendent Properties reservations team, we were set up with an incredible package for our four-night stay in a Prestige Villa during the shoulder season in May. Their promptness and professionalism, ensuring all our queries (including airport transfers) were handled within 24 hours, really impressed us from the start.

Arrival & First Impressions (10/10)
Landing in Colombo, we were quickly greeted by a hotel representative who guided us to our ride – a surprisingly spacious 10-seater Toyota Hiace. I'll admit, when the concierge first mentioned it was their only transport option, I was a bit skeptical, but boy was I wrong! This vehicle was pristinely maintained with plush seats, and our chauffeur, Harish, made the 2.5-hour journey incredibly comfortable. Most of it was smooth expressway driving, with only the final 20 minutes navigating the charming, narrow, twisting roads of Weligama town.

Stepping into the resort, we immediately felt that sense of minimalistic warmth and remote luxury. The front desk team, led by Salman, was lightning-fast with our check-in. Salman then took us on a wonderful buggy tour of the resort, giving us a perfect orientation before showing us to our stunning villa.

Location & Design (9/10)
Cape Weligama truly boasts the best location in Weligama, perched dramatically on a cliff overlooking the vast Indian Ocean. The resort's design, courtesy of renowned Thai architect Lek Bunnang, immediately reminded us of the Four Seasons Langkawi, albeit without the Moroccan touches. There's a beautiful prevalence of dark wood throughout, complemented by his signature purple wall in the main restaurant, which adds a distinct character. With just 30 villas and suites, the resort feels wonderfully intimate and compact. Just a heads-up: the path to the family pool and kids' club can be quite a steep decline, but buggies are always readily available to whisk you around.

Our Prestige Villa (9/10)
Our recently refurbished Prestige Villa was a dream at 180 sqm, offering supreme comfort for two adults and our daughter. It opened into a separate, inviting living area complete with a chaise, work desk, a fully stocked minibar, and a TV. This led seamlessly into the bedroom, featuring a king-sized bed with just the right level of softness, and another TV.

From the bedroom, you step into a walk-in wardrobe, which then opens into a huge, luxurious bathroom. It boasted a twin vanity, a lovely free-standing bath, and separate toilet and rain shower, which even had a sauna – a delightful surprise! The bath amenities were natural and custom-made with intriguing local spicy fragrances.

One of the highlights was the enormous outdoor seating area connected to our villa – it was absolutely perfect for a peaceful al fresco dinner. But the real star was the semi-private pool, shared between just 3 villas. Since it was the shoulder season, we practically had this huge pool all to ourselves, and our daughter couldn't get enough of it! The only minor points preventing a perfect score were the occasional dripping sound on the AC outdoor unit when it rained, which could be a bit disruptive, and the water temperature in the bathroom being a little erratic at times.

Service & Amenities (8/10)
The team at Cape Weligama, despite being fairly new, radiated a wonderful sense of warm, personalized service. Achal and the entire housekeeping team did a magnificent job, keeping our villa spotless whenever we popped out for breakfast. The kids' club staff, particularly Nithmi, were truly awesome – our daughter had a blast.

The concierge gave us a brilliant recommendation to visit Hiriketiya for sunset and check out Smoke & Bitter, a bar voted among Asia's top 50. And wow, did we have a fantastic time there! The family pool and beach shack were undergoing renovations during our visit, but they thoughtfully opened the magnificent Moon Pool for families, where we spent a good amount of time, with Kavindu always attentive to our needs. The on-site boutique, selling charming locally-made cotton clothes and Dilmah teas and spices, is a lovely spot to pick up some authentic Sri Lankan souvenirs.

However, there were a couple of areas that could see improvement. The gym, located beneath the main pool, had a distinct musty smell that made me feel slightly sick after about 30 minutes – definitely something they should look into. Another minor point, for a boutique property of this caliber, was the somewhat limited interaction with the management during our stay.

Dining (10/10)
Simply outstanding! We ended up having most of our meals right at the resort, and every single one was a delight. The Restaurant serves breakfast (a wonderful mix of local and continental à la carte options), lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. We feasted on loads of Sri Lankan Appa and curries, primarily sticking to the incredibly fresh, domestically sourced seafood. The service was personal and attentive, with Wishwa, Ramesh, Anjana, Nethmi, and Rusith taking wonderful care of us. On our last night, we tried Tableau for dinner, where Chef Dulitha put on a spectacular show with his innovative fusion Sri Lankan cuisine. A true culinary highlight!

Departure (9/10)
Checkout was efficient and seamless, and our excellent chauffeur Harish was there to drive us back to the airport. My only small suggestion would be to reconsider asking guests to fill out the survey right then and there. Perhaps asking the previous night or sending a link later would be a more relaxed approach.

Value for Money (10/10)
At around $500++ per night for our villa, you honestly couldn't ask for more. Even their peak season prices of $1000 seem entirely justified for the exceptional level of property and experience you get.

Probability of Revisiting (10/10)
Without a shadow of a doubt, we will be back! There is truly nothing that comes close to Cape Weligama in Sri Lanka, or even in India, in terms of its unique charm, luxury, and setting. With passionate owners like the Dilmah Group behind it, I can only see this resort growing further and returning to its previous glory, or even surpassing it, very soon.","Cape Weligama: A Slice of Cliffside Paradise in Sri Lanka","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1016675805-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

The check in process was very welcoming and pleasant. The staff were friendly and warm… the Resident Manager shared his contact and ensured any matter would be taken care of if needed. One particular staff I’m grateful for is (Salman) who was helpful with every request. This may sound hysterical but he was genuinely working hard everywhere at every time. Even though he’s working tirelessly day and night, he never said no to any request and actually did everything in his power to coordinate with the rest of the team and ensure every need was met. 

Even though there was no buffet for breakfast, the menu covered almost every type of food. For shorter stays, every item will surely not be covered. The taste and presentation of the food was beautifully executed as well. From the western dishes to the authentic Sri Lankan ones, it was truly remarkable. The usually overlooked bread basket was also splendid; special shoutout to one of the crispiest croissants ever!

The villas were also very cozy and beautifully designed to give it a nice touch of tradition whilst portraying the naturalistic theme the entire hotel is built upon. The Prestige Villa definitely weakened the competition and this was evident upon arrival at the next resort on this trip. 

All in all, if an all rounded experience is what’s needed, this is the place to visit. Definitely recommending for a hearty experience!","Luxurious service within majestic nature!","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1015858045-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

But my partner and I felt this place was truly an out of ordinary on several levels. I wanted to write this for others as I myself was unsure before booking it. But also as a reflection on an experience I won’t ever forget. 

We came to Sri Lanka because we wanted a luxurious break with some natural exploration and cultural exploration. My partner had been to India. I’ve spent time in Thailand and Indonesia for work and pleasure. I’ve stayed in seaside shacks I loved, airbnb and vrbo rooms and villas, boutique hotels and mandarin oriental /four seasons resorts in the past in my travels across the world. 

Arriving in Colombo - it’s worth paying for the expedited immigration- not at all necesssry but it was nice. We spent the night at a place near the airport as we arrived after midnight- cheap and cheerful and clean. We had arranged a driver for the whole trip (which is normal for Sri Lanka - they quote an all inclusive price including driver’s accomodation). A dedicated driver was the same price as airport hotel transfers and inter property transfers and gives you flexibility and a bit of a guide. Some drivers steer you towards places where they get commissions as is normal - so be aware. 

We took local roads to cape Weligama and with lunch it took us more than 6 hours - by highway it would have been half. And probably safer with less dodging tuk tuks, but also less colourful. 

The place is spectacular. I read before I booked to get a villa If you can afford it and I strongly agree. Again it isn’t critical but we loved the villas. And we had a premier one #37 which is closer to the center of things. It was beautifully designed - there is a good sense of privacy (although landscapers a s staff will sometimes walk around the shed but it didn’t feel bothersome). 

The bathroom is huge and gorgeous and luxurious. Pictures don’t do it justice. The steam shower was very nice. The towels and linens were commiserate with the environment. 

 Breakfast outside on our lanai/porch every day was magical. If you are in a villa it can be floating in your private pool or delivered. The fruit was particularly great. There were great squirrels around and one morning a mongoose as well as beautiful birds. It was idyllic. 

Overall the service was great and people seemed to geninuinely want to contribute to the experience and take pride in their environment. It has a relaxed atmosphere and not the Disneysque happiness at gunpoint feel. It is definitely not over programmed - while there are things to do and excursions - of you show up with a “here we are, entertain us” attitude, you may be disappointed. This is for people who want to connect with their environment and bathe in elegance and sophisticated design carved out of nature on the edge of the ocean. 

We particularly enjoyed the cooking class / some of the best food we had in Sri Lanka. It was great to see the extremely fresh ingredients and learn about the spices. We asked about a vegetable we had seen in a supermarket and presto it appeared - they take a lot of pride in their cuisine and ingredients. Aruna Kumara was the chef and he was ridiculously patient with us and we left feeling we could actually cook the dishes back home. Very highly recommend it. 

Also the spa was great - one of the best massages I’ve  had anywhere in the world was by Rina who was strong and anatomically focused/educated. It is usually one or the other if you are lucky. We went back a second time. The couples massage was also a great atmosphere and a centrepiece of our stay. 

Maga was the other massage therepist we encountered and she was lovely. She also runs yoga three days a week - perhaps my only constructive thought was that it would be nice to have yoga daily.one yoga session had the entertainment of monkeys cavorting in the trees. 

The restaurant is solid but it is also easy to eat out in the village - you could walk to local restaurants which looked good or quickly drive to beachside places where you pick your fish and they cook it. 

In addition to the pools shared by residences, there is a common moon pool with a breathtaking view and they will make you a coconut to drink :) pro tip - take it back and put it in your fridge. Cold they are on another level. 

Also you can walk down to the beach and swim in the Indian Ocean. There is also a bar there. The whole complex has pretty good wifi coverage. 

High tea was fine- not their strongest offering but it was fun to try the teas. Piuli (sp?) was a lovely and cheerful guide and introduced me to teas I would never have tried and now brought home.

We went on the local tea plantation tour. It was interesting. A little odd. Worth it to learn about tea and see cinamon being made. 

A note of recognition to Niswanathan (sp?) who I believe is the food and beverage manager and was accomodating and lovely when asked for help. 

Finally If it is in season - strongly recommend the maritime experience/whale watching cruise. It isn’t cheap - especially compared to local tours. But when we went out we understood why. It was fabulous. The crew is lovely. There was a very knowledgeable guide. The food was great. We were under sail a lot of the time. They are respectful toward the maritime life and a lot of local charters were awful - one of them almost rammed a Bryce’s whale rushing to get to it. 

Also - definitely recommend their sister property Wild Coast Tented lodge for two nights. But we love Cape Weligama so much we came back for an unexpected last night before we left Sri Lanka and it was the perfect ending to our trip.","An extraordinary experience.","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1004371366-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

From our arrival and an upgrade from villa to luxury villa, every moment here was a dream! We were fortunate enough to be at a villa next to the moon pool with views of the sea. 
The Moon Pool is one of the most special places in the world. The photos do not really show the sheer size of the pool. With views over the surf it feels more like swimming in a warm clean lake. We even came swimming here in the rain! 
The breakfast was really something! (as with every breakfast in Sri Lanka). 
We chose a villa as we were on our honeymoon and the apartments / rooms overlooked the family pool. Being April however (on the shoulder season) the hotel was quiet and often we were the only people in the pool. 
The villa we stayed in was enormous. With a shared but private pool. We had no need as we were so close to the Moon Pool. 
The restaurant for dinner was great too - although def on the more expensive side. We tuk tuk into weligama and tried the increibdle RISE pizza one night and loved it. the hotel can arrange the Tuk Tuk so I wouldn't let the price of the restaurant hold you back its really easy to get out. 
We had fun with a few games of pool. The surf here at the new beach was a little rough for the swimming but if we had bothered the beaches on either side of the property looked pretty good for swimming. 
We can not wait to come back. A wonderful, honeymoon stay.","Perfection.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1003879907-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

They were especially careful with my severe gluten allergy, with the main chefs offering to make or adapt any dishes I wanted, which I really appreciated. Given this, we were a bit disappointed that we weren’t able to eat at Tableau restaurant as my husband doesn’t eat fish, and they couldn’t adapt one dish.

Rooms are enormous, even our junior suite (smallest alternative) was larger than any other hotel room we have ever stayed at. All thinkable amenities included, quite a generous minibar policy too, where everything in the minibar is free once.

Staff is friendly, attentive and professional. Food was extraordinarily good, with a huge variety of everything from local curries to cordon bleu - the chef's version of the latter was very delicious! 

But what really sets Cape Weligama apart from other options, is the property: it's like walking into an enormous tropical garden, with fruit trees, flowers, birds and butterflies everywhere. On the property we also saw komodo dragons, cameleons, bright blue kingfisher birds. The pretty moon pool overlooks the beautiful bays below the cape where the property lies, but our most terrific experience was just sitting outside the hotel in the afternoon, with some wine, seeing the sun go down, listening to the life in garden; suddenly two grey langurs (rather big monkeys) sat down on the roof above us, before they ran off into some other trees on the property. A peacock wandered by. Next thing, a wonderful moonlit dinner on the nearby terrace. Cape Weligama is very tranquil and relaxing, but also interesting and fun!

Rather pricy for Sri Lanka, we would still chose this hotel over any other, should we return to the island.","Great hotel in a tropical garden","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r999888520-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

However, the music was a bit too much for a relaxing dinner and to enable dining conversation.  We stayed two nights and the second night was the worst! I'd suggest management  turn the volume down so people can hear each other talk. If not make sure you book a table outside or as far from the stage as possible. 

There is no air con in the bedrooms, just a fan and no fly screens so be prepared if it's a warm night. Our driver was really surprised when we mentioned no air con...

We chose 98 Acres Resort & Spa for our honeymoon, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. The resort is nestled among beautiful tea plantations with breathtaking views of Ella Gap, offering the perfect peaceful and romantic atmosphere.

Our chalet was charming and thoughtfully designed, blending beautifully with the natural surroundings. Waking up to the misty mountains and the sounds of nature was a dream. We especially loved relaxing on our private balcony — it quickly became our favorite spot to just sit back and enjoy the moment together.

A particularly memorable part of our stay was a traditional blessing ritual arranged by the resort. It was such a meaningful experience and added a lovely cultural touch to our honeymoon.

We also had complimentary access to the Ravana Pool Club, which had a great vibe and gave us the chance to unwind in a fun and relaxing setting. It was definitely a highlight of our trip!

While everything was truly special, we thought that a honeymoon cake or some romantic bed decorations could have made it feel even more personalized. Maybe it’s something the resort could offer future honeymooners.

All in all, our stay at 98 Acres was unforgettable. The staff were so warm and welcoming, and every detail was taken care of.

Wir waren in einem der Häuschen in der Lagune untergebracht und waren mit dieser Wahl sehr zufrieden. Das Gelände des Resorts ist riesig und es fühlt sich alles sehr privat und familiär an. Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich und nehmen sich Zeit für Fragen oder Anregungen. Einzig allein die Kosten für den Verleih der Kayaks und der Räder haben mich etwas irritiert. Irgendwie wäre es speziell für Nichtkiter schön, wenn der Verleih im Übernachtungspreis inkludiert wäre. Dies soll ebenfalls nur eine Anregung sein. Wenn der Wind passt, ist das hier für Kiter wirklich ein Paradies. Der Pool ist super schön und fügt sich ganz natürlich in die Landschaft ein. Die Möglichkeit eines Ausrittes auf einem der Pferde habe ich sehr geschätzt und ebenfalls toll, war es zu beobachten, wie liebevoll der Pferdepfleger den mit den Tieren umgeht.

One has a private balcony overlooking the garden & pool and the other, the master sea view suite has an enormous bathroom with claw foot bath. Thick foliage somewhat obscures the sea view but it is still a magnificent room. 

The public areas are beautiful and we breakfasted daily with a troupe of langur monkeys as our guests! The food is excellent and the pool is a welcome sanctuary from the heat and humidity of Galle.

But it is the lovely staff that makes this place extra special. They anticipate your every need and getting to know then all was a privilege.

They have converted an ancient house into this hotel and maintained the same style and architecture. Front door is usually locked but as soon as you press the buzzer on the right side, staff would come and attend you.

We came in a scorching hot day. As soon as we entered the hotel, staff guided us to the lobby/ lounge area. We were given a cold towel and a passionfruit popsicle as the welcome drink. I thought that was genius. Something cold to cool down. Place is clean, tidy and well maintained. 

We stayed at the premier seaview room. It was on the upstairs over looking fort walls and the front st. Room was surprisingly quiet. Bedroom was extremely spacious with a coffeetable and an old-school couch. Bathroom is the biggest I have ever seen in my life with a freestanding bathtub.

Staff were friendly and attentive. There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. However, staff would deliver a pot of tea as soon as you request one.

Well located and an oasis of calm from bustling Galle Fort where everything is within walking distance.

The house is beautifully fitted out with a veranda looking out onto the charming small garden with pool. Langur monkeys bounce through the surrounding trees.

The rooms are an utter delight. We had the garden view room so facing inwards from the street. Very spacious with a very large and comfortable bed and plenty of storage. We had a delightful balcony on which we could sit and the bathroom is accessed via the balcony. 

The bathroom had a lovely powerful and hot shower, basin and WC. Lovely cosmetics supplied and plenty of towels. Accessing via the veranda means a torch is helpful at night but there is a large privacy screen so there is no feeling of being exposed or overlooked.

Very good aircon and great soundproofing. We could not hear anything outside at night.

Breakfasts are a substantial multi course feast with the main dish ordered the night before so the kitchen has time to prepare it. Delicious. We had dinner one night which was a huge Sri Lankan curry feast, again delicious. Wine and beer is available but no spirits. Meals are taken at a shared table.

The staff are very attentive but discreet and someone was always available to deal with any matters. 

This was our last stop on our Sri Lankan holiday. We were so pleased that we had chosen to stay in Galle and particularly at Taru Villas.

From the moment I arrived, the staff were warm, courteous, and always ready to assist with a smile. Their hospitality created a welcoming atmosphere throughout my stay.
The room was spacious, airy, and exceptionally comfortable—not the typical stuffy hotel feel, which I really appreciated. The modern design and thoughtful in-room amenities added to the comfort. I also loved the bathroom—it was clean, well-equipped, and stylish.
One small hiccup was an unexpected fire alarm test during the afternoon while I was napping. The alarm came through the room speaker without prior notice, which was quite startling. I had to call the reception to confirm it was only a test. Later that evening, I noticed a notice about the alarm testing outside the door, but it definitely wasn���t there earlier. That said, it wasn’t a major issue—just something that could be improved in future with earlier communication.
Breakfast was another highlight, with a generous variety and the added bonus of being served until 10:30 AM—perfect for a relaxed morning.
Overall, a smooth and pleasant stay. I would gladly return and recommend it to others.","Excellent Stay – Comfortable, Welcoming, and Well-Appointed","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r1013581286-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The buffet breakfast offered a wonderful variety and delicious spread, catering to all tastes. For dinner, we dined at Prego, the Italian restaurant, and it exceeded expectations. The pizza was absolutely authentic, full of flavor, and generously portioned – easily enough for two!

One of the highlights was the rooftop infinity pool – the views were breathtaking and the rooftop area was peaceful and relaxing, perfect for unwinding.

The service was top-notch, and I would especially like to thank Mr. Rishitha Perera (Revenue Manager )for his warm hospitality and assistance in organizing our stay. His helpful insights made a big difference.

Nestled in the forested hills north of Kandy you really do feel a part of nature, within 5 minutes of checking into our room we were watching birds, lizards and monkeys in the surrounding trees from our balcony. 
We stayed 5 nights in the Sky Tented room with its private infinity pool that had the most amazing view across the valley and forests.
The resort is lovely. It was smaller than I was expecting, but that gives it a personal and intermit feel. 
The staff couldn’t be more attentive and helpful. 
The dinning experiences were delightful and after informing the resort, when I booked, that both me and my husband had vegan dietary requirements the chef and staff met the challenge with enthusiasm and smiles and were able to serve us up delicious and interesting (veganised) local dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is very much appreciated as we know how this can be quite an effort.
The elephant excursion we booked through the resort was incredible, with an informative guide and great driver. It was also simple to book a car and driver at the resort to take us down to Kandy Royal Botanic Gardens, which was a surprisingly delightful way to spend a morning without having to travel too far. 
We were also taken on a nature walk through the resort’s garden where we were shown spices, fruit and the local abundant bird life. 
Our only regret was that we didn’t book more days there as we passed up a few of the other interesting excursions on offer so as we could spend some more relaxing time enjoying the resort and it’s tranquility.","Nature and luxury go hand in hand at Aarunya Nature Resort","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r969640033-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The best resort we have ever stayed in, perfect resort to relax & actually unwind. We took all inclusive package & Sky tented room with private pool overlooking a spectacular green valley. anddddd it was sooo much worth it. Their super excellent service spoiled us from the moment you reach the resort. We were welcomed with a spectacular view & super warm staff. Also given a welcome 10 minute massage.  In the package, all meals were included which had 5 course meals every time. The chef was great & food was so delicious every time. Every day 30 minutes massage was also free in the package which was the cherry on the cake to relax completely. The property itself was beautiful & had short in the jungle kind of walkways to explore. It was a perfect getaway & the staff made it extra comfortable for us with their service. It’s a boutique resort so has like 9-10 rooms only mostly all with private pools I think. So the staff gives you full attention & comfort, be it getting you food in your room or at their restaurant. They have one restaurant at the lobby & fixed 4-5 course meal menu but still with 2-3 option in every course. They have Ala carte options too. Kids might not feel much to do in this resort apart from pool or some games. Thankyou to the whole staff for make it a perfect & super excellent stay 7/ for a thoughtful parting gift.

It's delightful to hear about your wonderful experience at Taru Villas! The intimate atmosphere created by having only four rooms certainly adds a personal touch to your stay. The combination of friendly, welcoming staff, refreshing ice lollies, and fresh fruit juices sounds like the perfect start to a memorable visit.

The decor's classiness, alongside a lovely pool and cozy seating areas, creates an ambiance of luxury and comfort. It's impressive that the villa maintains a delightful fragrance throughout, further enhancing the experience.

Your description of the breakfast as one of the best during your two-week trip, with its wide range of options from pancakes to traditional Sri Lankan dishes, highlights the quality and variety of their cuisine. The thoughtful gesture of organizing a delicious cake for your honeymoon is a testament to their attentive and considerate service.

Your recommendation for others to stay there, coupled with your appreciation for the 'smiley staff', underscores the exceptional experience Taru Villas offers its guests. Thank you for sharing your review; it's very helpful for anyone considering a stay at this charming villa!

This traditional Dutch Villa property has so much character and has been renovated and maintained with so much care - you can’t help but fall in love with it.
However it is the staff who make the experience truly magical. From the warm welcome to the delicious meals - we could not have asked for more. Special mention goes to chef Manju who is able to create everything from traditional rice and curry to the most amazing seafood platter we have ever had - we are especially grateful to the staff who were able to source the fresh seafood with only a few hours notice for our farewell dinner. 
We stayed as a family of 5 in the 2 upper floor rooms so it felt like we had the place to ourselves but it was also nice to meet the people staying in the poolside rooms over breakfast.
One thing we didn’t expect was the wildlife including a family of monkeys who seemed to love eating the flowers on the trees around the property and also some exotic reptiles. The staff always made us feel safe and looked after us in all respects.
Other highlights include relaxing in the freestanding bath in the huge bathroom upstairs and lounging under the frangipani trees next to the pool.","An unforgettable experience","2023-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d9591203-r880634582-Taru_Villas_Rampart_Street_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Taru Villas has an elegant colonial charm; understated but sophisticated decor, a beautiful garden with a small pool and sitting out area. Our room is was hugely comfortable with a palatial bathroom for those who love to languish in a bath; the bed was soft and there was a beautiful view.

Breakfast was plentiful and afternoon tea with a slice of cake was served by the pool.  The service is as discreet and impeccable.  Altogether a lovely sojourn.

Thank you for this amazing review! 

We offer our best in every way possible, and to be complimented as the best hotel in Galle is indeed very rewarding!

This boutique property on Rampart Street is closest to the Ramperts of this Fort and the front of the house overlooks the sea.
The property only has 4 bedrooms, 2 overlooking the garden pool, and 2 on the first floor.
We upgraded twice, first from a poolside room to the first floor room , overlooking the pol.What a room !
We would have been very happy there , but saw that the other room was vacant and overlooked the sea and was even larger and we were able to upgrade to that room as the property was quiet.
There are at least 4 staff led by Chamuth, who described himself as the Villa Guardian  and was available 24 hours a day.
We had booked on a B& B basis and then realised that we could eat her and had a lovely traditional Sri Lankan meal , which weirdly was priced in dollars but had to be paid for in SLR. 
The meal was very good but was quite expensive  but due to the personal service was worth it. 
in fact it was the most expensive meal we had in Sri Lanka ( including dinner @ AmanGalle) largely because an average bottle of wine was $35.

This place would be put to its best use with a group of friends taking over the whole Villa, but we enjoyed the personal service immensely and was rather spoilt by all the communal areas and the lovely pool.

I would highly recommend this Hotel and believe it’s the best in Galle but not the priciest for accomodation.","Probably the best Hotel in Galle","2022-11","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d9591203-r868265671-Taru_Villas_Rampart_Street_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I have a five year old daughter and she loved the place. There are separate activities organised for kids (like face painting, coin hunting, magic show) which my daughter enjoyed. 

The view from room are spectacular. We booked an ocean facing room and you can see the Indian Ocean from the room and adjoining balcony. Perfect place to de-stress with morning cup of tea or a glass of wine as you enjoy the sunset.

The breakfast spread is diverse with regular offerings and a special section for local Sri Lanka delicacies. They have Indian chefs to take care of Indian traveller needs - Puri bhaji, chole, dosa, etc

The pool is awesome with spectacular views of the Indian Ocean and there is an adjoining games/lounge area. What will win your heart is the exceptionally warm service, truly Taj standards. 

I would like to call out few individuals who made our stay memorable. Huge thanks to Asiria, chef Dalip Singh, chef Paramesh Gowda and his team at Palms; Don at Tease Bar (who whirred up amazing cocktails every evening), Sachith from house keeping. And above everyone, the General Manager Mr CB Matthews for his sterling leadership.

The sea-facing balcony in our room offered breathtaking views — and we clicked lovely photographs showing waves from there!

The swimming pool was the highlight ,many peoples were making reels for their social media. Kids loved the play area, again sea facing, open area. On our first day of stay, face painting was available. The health club was well-equipped with elliptical and treadmill machines, tried my hands for a quick workout.

In the night, there was the lavish dinner spread—a wide variety of dishes, and the Indian food, kadahi paneer to dasi and hopper,  was exceptionally good. Breakfast also impressed us with its extensive variety, kids have a lot of options to select their choice of food.

The bathroom was spotless, stocked with Taj branded toiletries, and the staff service was full of smiles and attentive throughout our 2 days of stay.

Greetings from Taj Bentota Resort & Spa

At the onset I would like to thank you for being a valued patron and delighted to know that you had a happy and comfortable stay with us.

I will share your feedback with our team and I am sure that this feedback will serve as an encouragement to all of our associates as we strive to create warm and memorable guest experiences.

Further to your feedback to the beds at the beach, wanted to share that since it is a public  beach, the beds are provided by the villagers. However as you would have noticed, the hotel provides the beds within the premises on the lawns

Also further to your observation on the LKR payment, the government has mandated for the room charges to be collected in USD. We do apologise that the team did not explain this better.

Thank you for your appreciation for our team members, Menaka and Chef Dalip. Your encouragement will further motivate them

Once again we thank you for sharing your valuable feedback and look forward to  welcome you back as and when you plan your next trip to Sri Lanka

Warm regards, 

Sibi Mathew

A couple of things did take away from the experience. At the beach, no beach beds were available unless we paid extra – which felt a bit unreasonable for such a basic amenity. And during checkout, it was quite odd to find out that LKR and UPI online payments weren’t accepted. It would’ve been helpful to be informed about these payment restrictions earlier.","Heartfelt Hospitality Made Our Anniversary Special","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1014995633-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The Accommodation is beautiful with stunning views of the fort. The staff are amazing and are truly attentive to all your needs. They go out of there way to say hello and guide you through the cuisine and hotel amenities. We had our own private pool which was luxurious. The only downside is the access road to the hotel (no fault of the actual resort owners). For my mind a hotel that is bringing in tourist dollars should be looked after however it is hard for any car to enter and exit. Additionally because of this you are stuck having to use the tuk tuks outside the hotel (again not associated with the hotel and scare away any other driver) rather then use pickme or uber. The local authorities should really look into making it a more hospitable environment outside the hotel and keep the tourists coming.","Only place to stay in Galle","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r1010542006-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The check-in staff were also attentive, and provided us with maximum assurance and hospitability by kindly arranging an upgraded, Signature room! 

The welcome drinks also had plentiful cool and warm drinks to choose from and we were able to enjoy them in front of the truly beautiful view captured from the lobby floor. 

The signature room was the perfect room that overlooked the Galle fort, beach and the hotel garden and pool as well as clean facilities. 

The rest of the stay was spent on enjoying the set-menu meals, where all options were perfectly curated to the local and foreign preferences. Each meal from lunch to dinner to breakfast was able to be enjoyed because of the peaceful restaurant service provided by the restaurant staff such as Nihal Ranasinghe!

For those who enjoy exploring, the hotel garden had a convenient access stairway to the beach, a mini library, spa and a great outdoor view that wrapped around the beach coast letting you truly enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of Galle!

Overall, the staff, services and facilities provided by Le Grand Galle show that this hotel is definitely a must to return as it is family-friendly, traveller-friendly, and beautifully scenic!

We ate breakfast and dinner here and absolutely loved the meals.

Loved everything about this place! We didn't kite surf and didn't make a difference to our experience. Hired kayaks and went around the lagoon and I went galloping on horseback along the beach at sunset which was amazing! 
Despite it being very windy (typical for that time of year) the restaurant/bar area and the beach front villas are well designed that it didn't matter and were able to get out of the wind. Meant the flies were less of a problem too. 
We stayed in a beach villa and loved it! Felt very safe sleeping under mosquito nets and loved the outdoor shower. Enjoyed coming back from dinner and counting how many frogs had made an appearance. 
All I would say is the stay here was by far the most expensive place to stay and eat from our trip but for the remoteness of the place I can understand and would happily go back.","Perfect end to a perfect holiday around Sri Lanka","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r956480303-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

First of all, we would thank you for taking the time to write us an Amazing review.

You have truly captured what Elements has to offer, and seems like you have fallen in love with the experience.

It's indeed so generous of you to write the review, and we fully understand why you were hesitant to do so. Don't worry the spirit of Elements will remain the same for years to come.

It's perfect for me. Truly authentic and a perfectly wonderful rustic living resort with just the right amount of needed touches to add a spark. 

We loved it so much we are coming back for a month this summer. That should be a true testament. And I am not easy. 

I could actually imagine living at Elements for a year or more and never be tired of it.

Expect a feeling of wildness. Expect to never wear shoes. Go kiteboarding every day and lay on a hammock at the end. Walk alone the beach and visit with local fisherman. Marvel at the surroundings and how pristine and beautiful it is. Eat well. Dream well. And wonder why you ever paid a fortune to stay at resort factories elsewhere in the world.

This is NOT the place if you are expecting Dj clad resorts or Aman style pampering (or prices). This IS the place if you want to truly detach and let go. Manage your expectations as to what you are after and you will find a true gem. 

For kiteboarders, it is one of the best spots I have ever been to. As well, the area is brimming with other spots to explore reasonably by boat (direct from Elements) or by Tuk Tuk. But you will enjoy just right outside the door both a lagoon and the ocean with fantastic conditions. 

My only suggestion for Kiteboarders is to perhaps bring some of your own gear. The rental kites, boards etc here are adequate but could use a bit of TLC. Do not expect new and cutting edge kites and boards. 

Lastly, I confess to being reluctant to even post this review. I really don't want anyone else to discover it. But I also can't help but make sure that people understand the specialness of this location and lodge.","Leave Your Shoes at Home","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r939663887-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

We were very impressed with our beach villa - a beautiful, spacious hut with a stunning outdoor bathroom.

We also loved the resident animals - all the dogs, donkeys, horses and ox.

The staff were the best bit and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. My husband was unwell due to sunstroke and they gave him an aryuvedic tea to settle his stomach.

One thing to be aware of at this time of year - the flies were a big problem due to low wind. They were everywhere and really spoiled our dining experience sadly.

Even though dolphins are common in this area we were the unlucky 2% that didn’t see dolphins or whales on the morning trip. We were absolutely gutted and planned to do the trip on our second morning but we couldn’t go out due to bad weather. Elements gave us a 25% discount and were surprised we were so unlucky - this is the downside of travelling in low season - there were very few boats out so little information about where to find the beautiful creatures.","Beautiful place, would recommend","2023-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r921554226-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

The garden setting was beautiful, and the food good, with plenty of choice, although a few more ""non Sri Lankan"" options would have been nice as my wife hates ""curry"". However what really set the Fox apart was the staff, at all levels, who were friendly, efficient and professional. 

A special mention should go to ""AK"" (Amith?) who took the trouble to remember our food and drink preferences, and spent time chatting about local places of interest, history etc and our plans for the rest of this trip.  He is a real credit to the hotel, as are his colleagues. The art display and historical photographs in the underground bunkers were an additional element that added to our stay.  

The Fox is a little out of the centre, not really walking distance, but that wasn't an issue for us.

But they did not give up asking around and they organised us a room in another hotel and also the transfer to the hotel.

They arranged that the day after we could stay in a beautiful room back in the Fox.

Everything was perfect. The food was excellent and the dinner was served in the romantic garden. After the hustle and bustle of the city, you immerse yourself in an oasis. You wouldn't expect such a great big well-kept garden in this hectic city. The pool was nicely warm and inviting for swimming. We were there at the weekend and we saw prefotoshootings for several marriages. For us as foreigners this was very interesting and entertaining.

The whole team, including the chef in the kitchen, the serving staff, the manager, the people at the reception, was very kind and helpful. They were always present, attentive and hospitable.

Food was an excellent representation of Jaffna cuisine and Chef Pushpe and his team are fantastic, the variety and quality perfect. 
My suggestion is to eat the local food, but omelettes and pastries are available.
Highlight was the Kottu corner which is excellent. 
Service!! Wow the waiters are so helpful speak excellent English. Scotty our waiter for most of the time told me he learnt how to speak English from you tube and speaking to himself in the mirror 
AK or Kumar was also brilliant. 
This team is led by a dedicated management team who work with the team and drive the vision of the company. 
Must see is the bunker, war time bunker turned into an art gallery, the theme of the hotel is Sri Lanka’s famous artists and each block is named in honour of one of them. 
Rooms are clean modern and fresh and each has a balcony, there are also 4 rooms in the original house.

The resturant staff in particular were excellent and always helpful.

Our room was within the old/heritage section of the hotel. The room was clean and nice, the bathroom was lacking a shower screen (appeared to be removed?) so got a bit wet but not terrible and we didnt mention it to the staff. The room did get a little warm at night (there is AC & fan), i think AC unit may hit a certain temp or running time and cut out potentially. As a result we did get a few mosquitoes in the room and had some bites during the night, nothing unbearable just a little annoying. Most mornings there were multiple wedding photos taking place on the grounds and you could hear them (very quietly shuffling outside) - if you're a light sleeper you may wake to them (my husband did but my daughter and I did not).

Next time we come I'd book a room in the newer section at the back. My parents room was in that section and was great - all the minor room issues would be resolved by booking the different room.","Lovely oasis in Jaffna","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d12210527-r993887105-Fox_Resorts_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",

Ayubowan!

Thank you sincerely for your glowing review and for taking the time to share your experience at 98 Acres Resort & Spa.

We are truly delighted to know that every aspect of your stay — from the breath taking views and beautifully designed rooms to the warm hospitality and spa indulgence — contributed to a five-star experience. Your kind words about our team and their attentive service mean the world to us.

It’s wonderful to hear you enjoyed both the local charm and international flavours at our restaurant, and that waking up to Little Adam’s Peak left a lasting impression.

We can’t wait to welcome you back for another unforgettable stay in the heart of Ella!

The rooms were beautifully designed — spacious, clean, and blending perfectly with the natural surroundings. Waking up to the sight of Little Adam's Peak right outside our balcony was absolutely unforgettable.

The staff were warm, friendly, and attentive throughout our stay. Every detail was taken care of with a smile, and they truly went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed.

We also enjoyed the delicious food at the restaurant, with a great mix of local and international options. The spa experience was equally wonderful — relaxing and professional with the most calming atmosphere.

We were all so in awe of the amazing picturesque views from pretty much every area of the facility. Our rooms had endless views of the canyon and mini Adams peak. So wonderful to wake up to and have a relaxing morning on the balcony. 
The room was so well layed out and spacious. Especially the shower and being able to look at the view while enjoying the rain head shower. 
Only negative would be to put a screen on the balcony door so you have the option of leaving open to allow ventilation. Especially as there is no AC. The fan however was ok. 
The restaurant and food was outstanding. Great touch having live music every night. 
One very disappointing experience was the Pekou tour that was organised by the staff manager with their inhouse naturalist (Sam). It was for 5 of us which cost 50usd each. Very expensive but we were happy to pay for the experience. 
Unfortunately Sam did not explain too much and seemed to be in a hurry as he was always well ahead of half of us. We asked for a toilet break only to be told there was not one available. 
Towards the end we wend down a very challenging descent which was very overgrown and we all experienced scratches and irritations as we had shorts. Sam had trousers and was oblivious to this. 
We were very disappointed with Sam and his lack of attention and knowledge of the area. 
Please in future pre-warn the guests of what to expect so we could be better prepared. Overall the 3 hour walk was very enjoyable and challenging. 
This did not take away from the excellent experience at your facility.","Family Holiday Experience","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1013068312-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The hotel offers a lot to do and you could easily spend a few days here. The on-site restaurant was very good, and the breakfast was large and delicious.

We only had one issue during our stay. During check-out, they were so kind as to do a blessing for my husband and I, giving us each a bracelet and box of tea.

All the staff were friendly and helpful, and even during our departure, the hospitality was excellent. However, we did face a small issue with the shuttle service for dinner. Despite calling in advance as instructed, the shuttle was not sent. After waiting, we had to walk. I reported the issue to the manager, who kindly assured me that they are working to improve their standards and ensure this doesn’t happen again.

The highlights for us were the food and the spa. They offer a really good selection of Sri Lankan cuisine—elevated just enough to feel special, but still authentic and full of Sri Lankan hospitality. It’s also reasonably priced. If you’re not in the mood for Sri Lankan food, their Western options are also excellent. I recommend the Eggs Benedict.

The spa area has beautiful views, and it’s a lovely place to relax while being pampered. Again, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the experience.

Suggestions for the hotel: It would be great if the hotel offered some excursions in their brochure, like private tours to nearby waterfalls or small adventures to make the most of the area.

A special mention to the staff who truly made our stay memorable — everyone was so friendly and always greeted us with a smile. Mangala provided us with outstanding service, and Prabhat was  attentive to our requests. We were also touched by the beautiful room decoration done by Asanka it made us feel truly welcome and celebrated.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a peaceful and pampered getaway.

Ayubowan!

Thank you so much for your lovely review and for choosing 98 Acres Resort & Spa, even on short notice! We’re delighted to hear you enjoyed the warm welcome, stunning views, and delicious food – especially the club sandwich and breakfast. We're also glad you took part in the early morning Little Adam’s Peak hike with our guide and enjoyed the tea and cookies afterward!

It was a pleasure to have you with us, and we too hope you can stay longer next time!

The Cliff Edge moon pool - stunning location and views. The staff at the Cocoon Bar were super friendly and always looking out to offer us a cool drink

Restaurant - the staff were flawless. The Executive Chef came out the first night to say hello and to discuss any requirements and subsequently arranged the most delicious Sri Lankan meal. Each meal was delicious and beautifully presented.

The Spa and Ali - I visited three times during my stay for various treatments including the 90 minute Ceylonese massage which was heaven. Ali was brilliant. The spa could do with a steam room and sauna to complete the overall experience.

The Front of House staff - for the warm welcome and personal farewell, assisting with our transfers and also day trip requirements. Plus a special gesture ( and much appreciated one) offering us a late check out to prepare for a late flight out of Colombo

The thoughtful gardener - he saw how delighted I was to have a peacock on our balcony.

Cape Weligama was our last big stop in the country. We were here for 3 nights and 4 days.

Coming from Ceylon tea trails and Anantara (more similar to Cape weligama) - we had the same level of expectations when it came to the level of service and room amenities.

Initially when we were shown our premier villa we were blown away by the view, outdoor living area, spaciousness, cake and Prosecco upon arrival - first impressions were overall very good. 

However we noticed some shortcomings to do with the room and general service (although staff are lovely and sweet) they weren’t as attentive compared to the other locations. 

We shared our honest feedback with the hotel and they have blown us away by how they have treated our concerns. 

On the second to last day Monty (GM) himself went out of his way along with his staff to ensure my husband and I would end up having a memorable and beautiful stay with Cape Weligama. They have really taken on board our feedback and have completely changed our minds about the place. They were able to move us to an even better room, offered us a complimentary evening dinner and met all our needs. 

Needless to say, after this will be back to stay at Cape Weligama.

Our 25 yrs son spoke highly of his experience during his backpacker/surfer visits to Sri Lanka, but we were looking for a higher level of comfort.
Cape Weligama is a member of the Relais and Chateaux hotel association. We have a friend amongst the management team at R&C whose advice I sought prior to our decision to book. I personally don’t enjoy Indian spices although my wife loves curry, hence the combination of western and local cooking at the resort was important. The resort scored perfectly well in that respect, overall, the food offering is very good.
We had booked a King bedded Master Suite and were allocated one in the eastern beach side of the property at ground floor level overlooking the “family” swimming pool in the “Arthur C Clarke” building of 4 suites.  The villa blocks are named after reputed writers, personalities, or navigators, coincidentally my wife’s maiden name is “Clarke”. We were a little disappointed with the view from our ground floor suite, the upper-level suites have more light, especially on the west side of the resort (closer to the adults-only halfmoon shape pool). During the first 24 hours there seemed an absence of senior management presence at the resort, but this significantly changed on our second day when having expressed our disappointment, the assistant Executive Director Mr da Silva met with us and expressed his objective was to ensure our full satisfaction. Since then we received an outstanding level of personal attention to our needs thought our stay.
Two days prior to departure, we received a complimentary upgrade to one of the higher elevation villas – this was very appreciated and offered spectacular sunset and ocean views with an abundance of wildlife proximity. Should we return, this would be the sector of the property that we would prefer.
The rooms are well constructed with good quality furnishings. Not quite the latest technology seen in more modern luxury hotels, but the internet connectivity was excellent, and everything works. The rooms resemble the earlier Aman properties we stayed in such as Amanpulo in Philippines.
There is direct access to a small beach where the hotel has a rustic bar with limited drinks. We sensed that this area could be improved with more extensive cocktails and smartened up.
As a guest you are assigned a “curator” or butler who’s role is as an individual concierge and point of contact with the hotel. Our curator “the Brilliant Brenden” was very attentive, and instantly responsive on WhatsApp, not only helping whist in the resort, but also being on hand and contactable during our off-property excursions.
Another star performer in their team was Mr Senith, the restaurant manager. Each day we would discuss our bespoke menu, and which place and time we would like to eat. These intimate dinners were a big plus to us offering variety and complete segregation when we wanted it, or mixed dining with other guests when we preferred. The Chef’s “Tableau” by example was a fun evening very well done, as was snapper fish cooked to our own recipe with roasted fennel and hollandaise sauce, as well as curry for my wife!
Activities included a marine biodiversity experience on a catamaran. This requires a 6am hotel departure. We do find nature and marine life interesting, and we encountered multiple dolphin pods, sadly we didn’t get to see a Blue Whale. The experience which included a swim and lunch at anchor near the port was not ideal, the sea was not particularly clean and visibility was impaired for snorkelling. Although we are boating enthusiasts, this would not be an adventure we would repeat.
Cape Weligama now has a dedicated naturalist, Mr Damitha who is very knowledgeable and added further engagement for us in the environment. Damitha is a recent addition to the team and should be encouraged to develop a broader range of nature activities. The property is home to numerous wild species. Complimenting the families of roaming Peacock we saw Indian palm chipmunk, monkeys, iguana, lots of beautiful birds and a quite rare civet.
The resort offers a range of spa treatments and massages that were professionally delivered. My afternoon Balinese massage performed by therapist Mega was a daily treat! However, the spa building does lack a relaxation area or any steam room/sauna plunge pool facilities which would be a welcome improvement.
Incidentally, prior to arriving in Sri Lanka I discovered that the production and sale of cigars is prohibited anywhere in Sri Lanka. This is a negative to be aware of; cigar smokers should travel with adequate stock for the duration of stay.  Thankfully, I stocked up at our previous destination and enjoyed my Habana cigar most evenings after intimate dinner with a welcome cognac or scotch whisky over a game of chess. Some political lobbying from the tourist department about cigars might be an initiative to create a useful concession in the rule.
This review is written from a global travel context using global not local comparisons. Overall Cape Weligama provided great personalised service and comfort throughout the eight days of our visit and is likely to be a destination of excellence by Sri Lankan standards. I would highly recommend it as a luxury destination for a global luxury traveller.","Luxury on Sri Lanka’s south coast","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r989773403-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Positives:

Beautiful location and Spectacular views.
Had Some of the best laid out rooms of our Srilanka tour
Had Some of the best food we had in our Srilanka tour.

Good access to the South region including the charming town of Galle.

We enjoyed our time here.

Negatives:

Service Level was not in line with expectations for an ultra lux resort.  Customization, be it tours or meals, was accommodated but after making it feel that you were being granted a ""favor"" , rather than a welcome and natural accommodation of the requests.

Staff communication was not as expected.    Hotel Senior Management was not at all visible, in contrast to all the other hotels we stayed at in our Sri Lanka tour.

The biggest negative is the value and quality of the ""experiences"" offered.  In my opinion massively overpriced in relation to what is provided

The beach is tiny. If you are looking for beach access it may be better to stay somewhere else (maybe the nearby Marriott).

All in all, this is a good hotel that could do a lot better by raising its service level and providing better value.","Nice Stay at the Cape Weligama","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r987900505-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Even though we stayed during COVID and there weren't as many things to do in Galle, my husband and I were very content spending time in the villa as the view is nice and the pool is also relaxing. While we were there, a family of monkeys passed through the trees and one of the staff members gave us bread and banana to feed them!

Something I appreciate was the mosquito repellent lotion in the room. I get bitten by mosquitoes all the time, but the lotion that Taru Villas makes and provides in the rooms was really great. I wish I could have taken it with me!

Also, the turndown service in the evening is very nice as we're able to come back to our room after being out during the day and the sheets and towels are replaced and everything feels refreshed.

Mostly commendable is the service of the staff. From the time that we stepped in, they were full of smiles and provided us with everything we needed. They were so attentive but not intrusive - which is extremely important. 
The hotel is located in a very convenient place within the Galle Fort and the location allows you to explore the Galle Fort leisurely.

Rampart Street fits into the brief perfectly. It is a gorgeous house with a colonial feel, great art on the walls and spotlessly clean.

The staff are just lovely. Friendly and professional, and keen to offer any help and advice, or just to let you get on with it.

The modest pool was a godsend, as Galle was very hot on our visit. We have been a number of times, however never stayed at hotel with a pool - and now I would say that it  is a pre-requisite (for us). 

The food was great - a good selection of classic dishes, both Sri Lankan and international, and served with pride. Very tasty, good size portions and a nice dining space.

Unusually for us, we did make use of the communal lounge area, watch a a couple of films - and that was fun, as we almost felt like we were residents of Galle !

Thank you for your review and for providing your constructive feedback.

We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.

Due to Sri Lanka's tropical climate, mosquitoes are unfortunately prevalent throughout the country. However, we take every precaution to ensure that this does not affect our guests - this includes monthly pest control treatment for the entire property, mosquito coils placed in public areas and citronella oil burners placed in each room . We also place a bottle of our home-made mosquito repellent in each room. 

Despite this, we understand that mosquitoes can still be an issue. Your feedback has been passed on to our team at Rampart Street so that they can do their best to counteract this issue. 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we hope you return for another stay at Rampart Street on your next visit to Sri Lanka.

The only two niggles: the sheer volume of mosquitos was incredible, but little the hotel can do about this! Mosquito net over the beautiful 4 poster bed, but didn't stop the little wotsits getting in. Secondly, the bathroom for room #2 is only accessible from the balcony, not directly from the room - so you really need to assess whether that middle of the night wee is worth going outside with the mozzies!

He struggled to describe his experience. It was a curious combination of excitement and awe which didn’t make sense at the time but piqued my interest. 

I finally did book in for a night in February 2024. I was greeted on arrival at the car park and a buggy was sent over for my bags. At reception were 4 individuals who were ever willing to assist me with any queries I had. A glass of fresh Amberalla (a type of local mango) juice and a 5 min relaxing neck massage from the on-location wellness spa attendant set the tone.

I was curious to see the resort so Gayan; the chief ambassador and I hopped into a buggy. The next 30 mins was most amazing. Even though I now live in the UK; I was born and have lived & worked in Sri Lanka for 25 years but never appreciated the sheer natural beauty that this country has to offer.  Dusk was approaching; the mist and darkness made the distant mountainous terrain look like the backdrop of a movie set. I was privileged to have seen the landscape at that specific time and let the image permeate and imprint itself into my psyche.

The final stop was the spas. Aarunya Resort has an on-site western wellness spa and an Ayurvedic clinic too. I decided on an Ayurveda massage which had me encased in a paste made from indigenous leaves and herbs. The clinic therapist was very knowledgeable and explained the entire process at every step.

Massage complete and now to my room. Each villa is named after the trees/bushes which surround it. I stayed in ‘Pepper’ with ‘Clove’ and ‘Nutmeg’ being about 20 meters further down the path. The villa has it’s own dipping pool with a view of the mountains.  The room was extremely spacious, decorated in a colonial style with an enormous en-suite. A four poster bed, a divan, a seating area and an office desk (with connectivity) occupied the room’s ample space. The free mini bar, some resort-chef made chocolates, Wi-Fi and satellite TV enabled me the home comforts I required for the hour before dinner.

The menu clearly had the luxurious touch and each dish was lovingly crafted and presented. The enormous wine list was quite unique for Sri Lanka too. Truly a 5 star experience.

The next morning, I walked around the resort to marvel at the natural landscape. The resort is situated on 10 acres of land and has 8 private pool villas with incredible views. There is a meeting room, library and a fully equipped gym on-site. Walking though the tea bushes, I discovered an open air tea room which serves high-tea. The rustic yoga studio is next to the spas and was in full swing and so was the village hut where guests learn about local agriculture and partake in a traditional meal made within the hut.

The resort is surrounded by nature trails and is 30mins away from a golf course and also the city of Kandy. Many of the guests had returned from a day’s excursion and relaxation was the focus.

My realisation is that this resort is a labour of love - there is a certain meticulousness to the detail at every turn. From the light switches to the sloping of the roof lights, from the wording on the menu to the presentation on the plate; it’s just so perfectly aligned with the vision of it’s creator.

The breakfast choice was western or Sri Lankan. I chose Sri Lankan and was not disappointed. Six courses of wonderfully prepared local cuisine. Just enough to tickle the taste buds with whole lot of flavour. 

This resort needs to be experienced first-hand. No amount of description can do it justice. I was there barely 24 hours but this experience will live with me forever. Thank you Aarunya Resort, we shall meet again.

Pros:
- Beautiful design and breathtaking view into the djungle (depending on the room type)
- Ideal for relaxing
- Staff is super friendly and always helpful
- Good (but bit pricy) food
- Butler service, in-room dining and minibar free of charge

Cons:
- Especially for Sri Lanka super expensive
- Air condition in tented sky villa is (by principle) not very helpful because the tent heats up super quickly. We tried to let it run almost all the time at the lowest temperature possible and it was still so warm that it was hard to sleep at night
- Condition of tented sky villa and its interior was a bit used and had at some places stains
- Location is a bit remote between Kandy and Dambulla - consider this if you plan to make trips to Kandy, Dambulla or Sigiriya","Real blizz with some minor cons","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r941984329-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Unfortunately, there were a few technical issues with the room, such as the hot tub not heating up to be hot and the controller for the AC wasn’t working as it should. There was also some building work going on at the resort which was next to our villa so there was some noise in the morning (this may only be applicable to the villa we stayed in).

Nestled amidst breathtaking Sri Lankan hills, this intimate haven surpassed every expectation, offering a symphony of breathtaking scenery, luxurious comfort, and impeccable service.

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the resort's breathtaking setting. Lush greenery hugged our private villa, with the majestic Mountains painting a dramatic backdrop (we even could see Hunnas Falls from our room). 

Our villa was a haven of tranquillity. Stepping inside was like entering a luxurious cocoon, with minimalist elegance blending seamlessly with warm Sri Lankan touches. My sun loved having his own bed in the spacious room, while we had the king-sized bed and private pool and jacuzzi on the balcony – the perfect spot to unwind with a glass of wine under the starlit sky. Every detail, from the plush towels to the locally sourced toiletries, exuded quality and thoughtfulness.

The staff at Aarunya truly made our stay unforgettable. Their genuine warmth and attentiveness were unparalleled. Every request was met with a smile and a can-do attitude. We had almost all our meals at our private villa and only had breakfast at the main dining area with stunning views.

Aarunya offered everything we needed on a holiday and leaving it was bittersweet, but we carried with us a deep sense of gratitude for the experience. It wasn't just a vacation; it was a complete immersion into nature's splendour, luxurious comfort, and genuine Sri Lankan hospitality. Aarunya is more than just a resort; it's a piece of paradise, a sanctuary for the soul, and a place we will undoubtedly return to for years to come.

5 stars – highly recommend!","Paradise Found: 5-Star Serenity at Aarunya Nature Resort","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r932787841-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We had a lovely beach villa. The villa has a porch swing and a giant hammock to enjoy the view. 
It is owned by a very nice Swiss-German family and their two lovely daughters.  They are always inn for a chat and are very passionate about their project and involving the local community. 
We were there 2 nights with our two boys 14y and 11 y old and had a great time. The dolphin watching tour was amazing. The boys swam in the ocean for hours and there was a lovely pool.  We could borrow bodyboards and had lots of fun. You can also learn how to kite if you are in to that. 
The food is excellent and the waiters were very friendly, funny and helpfull. We got fresh tuna and  traditional Sri Lankan curries. We asked not to add all the spice, because our European taste buds can not take it, and it was perfect. 
There are donkeys on the beach and several, well cared for, dogs and cats. 
We were really sad to leave and would go back there in a heartbeat. 
Definitely worth doing a detour for this hotel. ","Hidden Gem ","2022-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r874104929-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

The staff is super friendly, everything was perfectly organised, food is super delicious and the resort in general is just a beautiful place on the beach and in the nature. We stayed as a couple in a lagoon villa and can highly recommend.

The kite spot is a dream for every kitesurfer. On one side there is a lagoon with flat water, on the other side you can ride in the open sea and enjoy the waves.

We have visited the resort in July 2022 during the crisis in Sri Lanka. But in the Elements Resort we did not notice much. Everything worked perfectly! The transfer from and to the airport was organised from Elements and worked, although there is a big fuel crisis in Sri Lanka.
There is no reason to not visit the Elements Resort in this crisis.

One issue that should be addressed is the smell of the drain near the bidet - was in room 1905. I did not use the bidet but that drain makes the bathroom smell like sour water. I didn’t complain to staff at front desk as I knew there wasn’t likely much they could do about this, however building management should look into this.","Great stay!","2025-05","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r1005492673-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The staff was exceptionally welcoming and supportive, especially Nethmi at the front desk. She warmly welcomed me, assisted me throughout my stay, and was kind enough to show me to my room and give me a tour of the amenities. Her kindness and professionalism truly made my stay even more enjoyable—thank you, Nethmi, for going above and beyond!

While the in-room dining menu and food selection could have been better (though I’m sure the hotel restaurants offer more variety), the excellent service and room quality more than made up for it.

I would definitely stay here again, and for anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing stay, I highly recommend this hotel!","Great place to stay in colombo","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r998216611-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We booked a heritage room which opens to the front courtyard. Spacious and comfortable room with necessary amenities. There was no shower cubicle and water splashes everywhere. Staff was kind enough to provide us with extra floor mats. Better to fix the problem permanently. 
Buffet was not that great and didn’t have much variety or authentic Jaffna food. Exceptional services by the restaurant staff. Apologies for not remembering their names. 
Highlight was the opportunity to visit traditional bunkers with impressive art work. Worth a visit.

We left on Saturday 7th June with lasting, fond memories and very much looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka again, if not in Bentota, we will definitely book another Taj hotel on the island.

 

We'd also like to extend our gratitude to all the unsung hero's working behind the scenes to create such a beautiful ambiance. The maintenance team, the gardeners, the chefs, they all do a tremendous job ensuring everything works well,  the grounds looking beautiful and the guests fed to such a high standard 

 

The house keeping staff looking after our room were exceptional and the waiters, waitress and guys working around the pool were all so friendly and never without a smile. The reception team were always welcoming and helpful and the security team and the front gate were always ready to greet us no mater what time of day or night.

We had an unforgettable honeymoon at 98 Acres Resort & Spa. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality stood out. The staff greeted us with a traditional ""Aarathi"" ceremony, setting a serene tone for our stay.

We chose the Royal Deluxe Cabana on a bed and breakfast basis. The accommodation was a blend of rustic charm and modern comfort, featuring eco-friendly designs with thatched roofs and furniture. The balcony offered panoramic views of the lush tea plantations and the majestic Little Adam’s Peak and Ella rock. 

A highlight of our stay was the complimentary sunrise tour arranged by the hotel. Accompanied by a knowledgeable guide, we trekked to the top of Little Adam’s Peak. The sight of the sun rising over the misty mountains was truly magical—a moment we'll cherish forever.

Dining at Restaurant 98 was a delight. We enjoyed a diverse breakfast buffet with both Western and Sri Lankan dishes, including the must-try egg hoppers.

On site parking available",,,,,,,,,,,,,"From the moment we booked to the day we checked out, 98 Acres Resort & Spa offered an exceptional and seamless hospitality experience that exceeded all expectations.

Reservation Experience:
We took advantage of a special Room Rush offer and booked a Suite Room directly through their website — a fast, intuitive, and convenient process. What truly impressed us was the thoughtful follow-up. A day before our scheduled stay, the hotel sent a personalized reminder email — a first for me with any hotel, and it genuinely saved the day as I had completely forgotten the date!

Getting There:
We drove from Colombo via Beragala–Wellawaya–Ella route, which took about 5 hours. The scenic journey itself was a treat — filled with lush greenery, waterfalls, and mountain views that set the tone for what was to come.

Arrival & Check-In:
We arrived at 2:00 PM and were warmly welcomed by the smiling staff with a traditional blessing and a refreshing iced tea. The check-in process was swift (just 5 minutes), and we were chauffeured to our suite in an eco-friendly electric buggy.

Personal Butler Service:
Our butler, Mr. Haridharan, was exceptional — offering a full room tour, explaining all facilities, dining options, and activities around the resort. His attention to detail made us feel genuinely cared for throughout the stay.

Exclusive Offers:
Upon check-in, we received 15% off at the Ravana Pool Club and 10% off on the nearby Mega Zip Line adventure — an unexpected bonus!

Dining & Culinary Experience:
Dinner was a delight, enjoyed in our room with a golden sunset view of Mini Adam’s Peak and Ella Rock. Their à la carte menu features both Sri Lankan and Western options. Every dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and served in generous portions.

The Main Restaurant is just a two-minute walk — spacious, ambient, and operated by highly professional staff. The bar offers a wide selection of beverages including exclusive 98 Acres cocktails. We highly recommend trying their signature drink called “Pickle” — a unique, refreshing cocktail experience.

Unmatched Views & Ambience:
Every villa is strategically designed to face breathtaking views of Ella Rock and Mini Adam’s Peak. Sunrise was absolutely magical. If you’re into stargazing, this is the place — the night sky revealed a million stars, a rare sight for city dwellers.

Facilities & Activities:

The Mini Bar was well-stocked (chargeable)

Gym and spa services are must-try

ATV rides, zip lining, skywalks, abseiling, and more at the Ravana Adventure Zone, just a short hotel shuttle ride away

GoPro and drone video options are available at very reasonable rates (bring your ID or driver’s license)

The Halpe Tea shop on-site offers the finest Ceylon teas to take home

Service & Staff:
The staff — from housekeeping to the executive team — are impeccably trained, respectful, and proactive. Their warm hospitality reflects true Sri Lankan charm and professionalism.

Unique Touches:
As a final gesture, guests are blessed according to their faith before departure — a thoughtful spiritual send-off. We were also gifted a complimentary pack of Halpe tea.

---

Final Verdict:
98 Acres Resort & Spa is not just a hotel — it's an experience. With top-tier service, stunning scenery, mouthwatering cuisine, and well-curated activities, it is undoubtedly one of the best resorts I’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended for both locals and international travelers.

The restaurant was again beautiful and the staff were extremely polite and attentive. 
The hotel is a short walk from Ella and the nine arches bridge, making it the perfect location for your stay exploring Ella and the surrounding area. One morning we joined the ranger and walked to Little Adam’s Peak, approximately 15/20 mins from the hotel and well worth the early morning wake up call, the views were incredible.

We hired a driver (Randika from SeeLanka Tours) and he came to collect us in Colombo from our hotel, and drove us to 98 Acres in Ella. We even saw a wild elephant on the side of the road, and visited a beautiful waterfall along the way. So even the drive to Ella (which took 5 hours along the southern expressway) was fascinating. 

Once we arrived in Ella, we were so grateful to have chosen 98 Acres. We had a beautiful room that overlooked nature. We even had a peacock come and sit on our verandah on the final morning before we checked out. He was completely at ease, chilling there for at least 2 hours, giving us a chance to carefully take some pics without scaring him off. 

The staff were amazing - absolutely 10/10 in their friendliness and helpfulness. The food was spectacular, and the chef went to such great lengths to ensure we had food that was within our dietary requirements (gluten free for me). And the place is so unique and with such spectacular views over Little Adams Peak and Ella Rock. Every day provided such wonderful opportunities for photographs. 

There were a few minor things I noticed which weren't 5/5: 

1. The glass for the shower doesn't extend to the wall, so every time we used the shower, water splashed over the toilet. 
2. We did hear the noise of the buggies (vehicles which carry guests around the property) from our room, and because we had the top floor of the villa and another couple had the lower floor, there was some noise transfer (we could hear them talking). I ended up using ear plugs the first night, but didn't need them the second night. 
3. We had an Ayurvedic 1 hour massage at the Spa on site, but neither of us were impressed with our therapists. My friend and I are both trained in Ayurvedic massage and we both teach massage. If I visited again, I would find a massage clinic off-site where I can get a proper Ayurvedic massage. The upside was that the view and environs of the Spa on site at 98 Acres was stunning, so we got some great pics for facebook and Instagram.","An amazing place to stay in Ella","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1007072048-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Here, Cape Weligama (Relais & Chateaux) stands out as the premier destination. This renowned hotel boasts 39 boutique villas and suites spread across 5 hectares of a former coconut grove on the dramatically picturesque Cape Weligama. The primary draw of this location is the stunning views, views, and more views.

The Ocean Terrace Restaurant, where guests gather for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is perched on a cliff, providing an unparalleled vantage point to take in some of the best scenery imaginable. 

Cape Weligama also offers three secret spots—secluded areas perfect for watching the sunset. Each spot is equipped with a table and chairs, and can be reserved for a romantic lunch or dinner. 

The villas themselves are spacious, each covering at least 130 square meters, and are built in the local architectural style. Each villa features its own private pool (shared between two or three villas) and a spacious terrace furnished with a table, sun loungers, and a sofa. It's an idyllic spot to sip tea while listening to the tunes of Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.

The cuisine at Cape Weligama is another highlight. Talented chefs deliver an impressive culinary experience starting with breakfast. However, the evening meals truly showcase their skills. A standout feature is the Chef's Table at the Tableau restaurant, where a seven-course dinner is prepared before your eyes. This culinary journey includes appetizers, soups, sorbets, main courses, and desserts, making for an unforgettable dining experience.

Chef Ishara Wijesinghe has honed his craft in various countries including Dubai over a 20-year career. He returned to his homeland to perfect his skills in Sri Lankan cuisine, infusing it with European gastronomic techniques. The result is exceptional—his cooking method could easily earn a Michelin star. Guests can ask about the secrets of local cuisine, get excellent recipes, and engage in conversations about global culinary traditions and life in general.

For those seeking adventure, Cape Weligama offers a variety of activities, from surfing lessons and whale watching excursions to guided tours of nearby tea plantations and historic sites. In conclusion, Cape Weligama is not just a place to stay; it's a destination that offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and immersive cultural experiences.","Wonderful Stay","2024-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r952674682-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

All of the butlers, to bartenders, to maintenance around the property to the managers, were genuine and sincere to see you. Another highlight was tasting the different fruit or flavor infused arracks at the Surf Bar onsite. The drinks the bartenders made with those arracks were unreal! 

We stayed in the master suite, and the room was huge with a large private deck with seating. The all wood walk in closet was a nice touch to tuck away our suitcases out of the way, and the rainfall shower was the best treat after a swim at the beach nearby. The shower room also turns into a steam room, although we didn’t try it. And the half moon infinity pool! Highly recommend a swim there at dusk, as it’s pretty incredible to watch the sun go down and surfers below.

The Cape Weligama hotel is at the luxury end of the market price wise but mostly lives up to expectations. The villa was beautiful and we shared the private pool with only one other villa (tbh we had it to ourselves most of the time) and housekeeping by Sadasheena and Vimukthi was fantastic. We were there for 13 nights, started on half board for one week then cancelled that for the 2nd to give us a bit more freedom of choice as the evening menu did not appear to change.
We got out and about using a brilliant local tuk tuk driver, Viraj +94 773969530, who was a very safe, honest and reliable driver and I highly recommend using him. He lives with his family a few hundred yards from the hotel and would appreciate the work.
Inoka looked after us on arrival and Madushan was invaluable in making our departure so easy and stress free.

Food excellent large choice. A number of items repeatedly not available - would suggest amending the menu.

We stayed three nights and felt that it may be better to have a menu which changed as opposed to the same, however there was a wide choice. 
2 swimming pools, the half moon one was beautiful and quiet and no children under 12. 
Staff excellent special mention to waiter ‘Wishwa’ who went above and beyond especially when they had some staff off sick. 
Rina in the Spa - excellent pedicure. 
Negatives
Steam room in our bathroom did not work and could not be fixed
Lighting in wardrobe/ dressing room poor

It was a very generous serve with plenty of lobster and the pasta was cooked to perfection. 

Breakfast was also delicious with plenty of choices and fresh juices. The staff were all incredibly friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.

 The villa rooms are incredibly large and spacious and tastefully furnished, more like the size of an apartment. 

The property is very hilly but good if you like the exercise. There is no beach to swim at as rocky below, although the pool is fabulous. Buggy's are available on call. 

We booked a premier villa but did have to share the pool with others which I was not a fan of. Plus, we had another villa above us which took away our privacy.

Disliked  · The only dislike was there were no fans outside on the verandas which was annoying if just wanting to relax and read, without them it was far too hot. 

Overall - Lovely traditional boutique style hotel nestled on a side of a hill with a beautiful sweeping ocean vista below.

Firstly,  the rooms are outstanding.  We stayed in a junior suite which was so well equipped. Many bottles of water,  replenished daily with a very well stocked mini bar with beautiful little chocolates and biscuits left in the room every night. 
The bathroom was outstanding, again with EVERY detail covered. 
The restaurant and food was of an exceptional standard and the service was superb. My breakfast,  daily,  was a delightful 'Crab chilli scrambled egg on toast with a crab emulsion'. Dinner was equally exciting and delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed the private candlelit dinner over looking the sea,  watching the fisherman coming and going in the dark. 
Service - how or where do I start? Nothing and I mean NOTHING,  was too much trouble for any member of the incredible team that made our stay so exceptional.  Very special thanks have to go to Thorundu and his team, also the delightful restaurant manager,  who constantly pointed out things of interest,  including rare mammals and planets that could be clearly seen at night through his telescope.

Although my parents were slightly delayed at check-in and Niroshan wasn't available at that time, he had thoughtfully arranged for his guest service manager to personally look after them. Everything was handled with such warmth and professionalism.

Thank you once again, Niroshan, for your kind attention and memorable service. We are truly grateful — and we will definitely return once we’re back in Sri Lanka.

The staff was so friendly and accommodating, probably few of the best from among all the Sri Lankan hotels I’ve been to. 

Due to the continued rains we weren’t able to use the pool but the pool area was very pretty.

Me and my husband wanted to go to Kandy  for his birthday, but I had to reschedule this booking 2-3 times because I got sick. I left a note in the initial booking that it was my husband’s birthday and they actually followed through and got a cake with candles and everything even after we went there 10 days later. Both my husband and I got surprised 😂❤️ Such a sweet gesture.

Conveniently located. 

 One of the best rooftop views in Colombo (@ night). 
 I had visited a magnificent Amari hotel in Bangkok few years back hence my expectations were understandably high & was not disappointed!

We had dinner at their Ahara Restaurant.  International buffet.  Reasonably priced. 
Beautifully and tastefully done Restaurant. 

The food was exquisite! Chefs stationed at the buffet were helpful and knowledgeable, they were only too happy to answer any question pertaining to displayed food items.

Mr. Udesh gave us a most hearty welcome and was ever so courteous throughout the evening. 

Apart from the dinner buffet, we ordered drinks: cocktails & cocktails - delicious!

Our servers Mr. Umesh & Mr. Theekshana were friendly and obliging.  Very well trained. 

Prior to dinner, we visited the rooftop bar and the Italian restaurant.  The ambience was cosy and classy.  Wonderful staff there too. We will visit for a meal to this restaurant in the near future. 

Much thanks to all front office staff for their hospitality as well.

Great job... Amari, Colombo!!!  We were impressed!","Lovely city hotel ","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r997900110-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Our bedroom was incredibly comfortable—like sleeping in a queen’s retreat. And the bathroom? Taking a shower felt like being in a tropical forest—absolutely magical and refreshing.

The staff was attentive and patient with us. As Deaf travelers who rely on ASL, we really appreciated how supportive they were. They communicated with us using apps on our phones, which was awesome and made us feel truly welcome.

Another highlight was the boat tour around the area. We saw bats and many beautiful local birds—very cool!

The only possible downside is that the location is quite secluded and set in a residential neighborhood. But for us, that was actually a plus. We wanted peace, privacy, and a break from the typical tourist crowds.

We stayed at *Waterland Hotel in Negombo* in the *Monsoon Family Villa* for two nights.  
We were a family group: parents and three grown-up children.

The hotel staff were kind and attentive, making us feel welcome throughout our stay.  
The location is peaceful, not in the city center, and right next to the Dutch Canal.  
The rooms were spacious, clean, and had a private pool.

Breakfast was excellent – it's recommended to pre-order special dishes from the menu the evening before.  
Dinner was very tasty, and we especially recommend the local Sri Lankan dishes.

In the morning, we went for a walk and visited the local fish market.  
We also took a family boat ride from the hotel along the Dutch Canal for $55. We saw interesting wildlife, and our guide, Medzara from the hotel, was wonderful.

The hotel features a billiards table over 100 years old. We met Mark, the hotel owner, who was very friendly and shared stories about the place.

There are also bicycles available – it’s a good idea to request them in advance so they can be prepared.

We warmly recommend the hotel!

In my previous reviews I have written extensively why Waterland is my most favorite little hotel in Sri Lanka. In short, its exquisite beauty in the milieu of the majestic Maha Oya, environment-friendly building standards, friendly & efficient staff, and divine privacy for each villa, create an atmosphere to make you feel special.
Around the time of the sunset, we had an opportunity to observe the devotional ritual of fishermen in front of the church on the bank of Maha Oya just before their night departure to the sea. A melancholic melody of blessings from the church choir echoed through the serenity of dusk hinting a sense of harmony.
We were very happy to see the gracious owner, Mark once again on the premises, who made us feel even more special with a champaign welcome. We enjoyed a tasty hoppers dinner on our private deck in a festive atmosphere surrounded by Mark, two of his senior staff members, twinkling lamps, flashing red, green, blue hues emanating from the private pool and an occasional flying dog bat whizzing by above us.
We will be back to Waterland soon enough.","Another magical night at Waterland","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r1009332098-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We stayed in the Elephant villa which had a lovely small pool with fantastic views of the river. The villa was charming with an interesting bathroom- the open shower was in the middle of the room adjacent to an indoor pool with fish. The bed was large & comfortable & the air on was excellent. We were introduced to the ‘mini bar’which had only a bottle of water in it. Maybe this could be improved with a few beers/soft drinks?
Breakfast was lovely. We are not big breakfast lovers but the Sri Lankan omelette was lovely. We took advantage of the floating breakfast on our final morning which was an interesting experience! We ate dinner & the curry & rice was lovely if a bit cold. I’d like it a bit warmer.
We did the boat trip & saw lots of monitor lizards, birds & enormous fruit bats. It lasts about 1.5 hrs & was very interesting & worth the money.
The highlight was our own pool & whilst facing north you get plenty of sun from 9.30am, in fact we got too much & suffered later.
The location near the airport lends itself well for the beginning or ending of your holiday & I’d recommend this hotel.with a couple of minor tweaks it would be perfect eg. Music a bit loud at breakfast, more comfortable dining chairs, options in the mini bar.","A hidden gem","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r1001523573-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

It's good of you to describe the boat safari so lovingly.  While the hotel itself offers the chance to experience life by  the water, the boat safari offers the delights of being on the water.  The guided tours on decorated boats have become an integral part of the Waterland experience.  It's so nice to hear that you had such a magical experience on the boat safari.

Wir freuen uns, dass Ihnen Ihr Aufenthalt gefallen hat und Sie die Einrichtungen, das Essen, die Villa, den privaten Pool und die ruhige Umgebung genossen haben.

Vielen Dank für Ihre Sorge um die Tiere. Wir stimmen Ihnen zu. Vögel sollten grundsätzlich nicht in Gefangenschaft gehalten werden.

Im Laufe der Jahre hat sich das Hotel um streunende Hunde, Katzen, Vögel, Reptilien und andere Tiere gekümmert. Wir bieten diese Tiere dann zur Adoption an.

Die Vögel wurden verletzt und dem Hotel zur Pflege übergeben oder gerettet. Sobald diese Vögel in Gefangenschaft sind, haben sie kaum Überlebenschancen, wenn sie in die freie Wildbahn entlassen werden.

Wir werden die Gründe für die Käfighaltung dieser Vögel besser kommunizieren.

Alles Gute vom gesamten Waterland-Team.","4032","790048013","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/17/2d/0d/caption.jpg","3024","4032","790048014","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/17/2d/0e/caption.jpg","3024","1200","790048015","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/17/2d/0f/caption.jpg","1600","3024","790048016","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/17/2d/10/caption.jpg","4032",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2025-02-25","OTHER","5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sehr nettes, familiäres Hotel mit komfortabler Ausstattung und sehr freundlichem, kompetenten Personal.

Nothing is too much trouble. The reception staff from the bell boy to the money exchange service and customer service assistants, all have lovely smiling faces and are so helpful.  Chamodi was amazing when we needed to change rooms due to myself having an injury to my ankle 2 days before arriving and having a little difficulty with walking. 
 Lovely huge pool, The pool guys Priyantha, Sarath, and Nimal cann ot do enough for you and work extremely hard to ensure everything in and around the pool is clean and tidy and you have everything you need. 
Rooms spacious and clean, with everything you need, BUT the hairdryers are not the best, and lighting in bathrooms is not good for ladies applying make up. Seating is not comfortable on the terrace and could do with some improvement, it seems they are more for aesthetics than comfort. 

The Buffet restaurant is what took my review from 5 star to 4 star.
Food was of a high quality and plenty of choice, BUT some of the combination options seemed a little strange, such as when battered fish served there were no Fries, ( in fact  there were never any fries in 2 weeks) Sri Lankan bbq night was a huge hit with the most gorgeous baked potatoes, ( would have been nice if they could have substituted the mashed potatoes at least once or twice on other nights). Roast Potatoes not parboiled just potatoes cut and put in an oven, and came out very hard and barely roasted.  Vegetables very fresh but were almost raw, aldente is good but these were the wrong side of aldente. Food that was not cooked on the stations, was not hot, in fact was barely warm.  
The 2 cool rooms, one for salads and one for desserts, need to be monitored very carefully by management, many times not enough tongs/ serving slices, meant cross contamination. If anyone had a nut allergy they would not be able to have anything in the dessert room. Thankfully nut allergy was not a problem for us but a fish allergy was, and almost caused a problem in the salad room had I not been so vigilent watching my sister in laws choices, as labels had been moved around. 

Afternoon snacks very very poor.

If you require milk for tea in your room just ask in the buffet restaurant they are happy to help. 

On the whole we had a fabulous time, yes it was rainy season, but rain was mainly at night or early morning. Yes we will be back next year. Trips we did this time Udawalawe, Pinnawala, and Colombo city tour, all booked with Bonni at Ranga Tours, just outside the hotel across the train track at the massage centre, which also did amazing 1 hour massages for just £15. 

A couple of things to bear in mind and for management to review.
lots of small steps 4 or 5 at a time, but better handrails needed with these not something i would normally think of but an injury (before I came) made me realise that people with mobility issues could use some extra support. Better lighting in bathrooms. Better hairdryers.","3rd time in sri lanka, and the best hotel we stayed in.","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r1014768754-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The service throughout our stay was exceptional.  All the staff were helpful, friendly and a credit to the hotel. The hotel had excellent facilities, lovely grounds, was well maintained and always clean. 
Although there was limited access to the beach, the hotel grounds and  pool more than made up for it. 
The choice and quality of food in the main restaurant was excellent. There were always a good mix of local and western dishes. While mainly buffet style, there were also a number of chef stations offering freshly cooked options. There was also a room within the buffet area dedicated to the most amazing cakes & desserts.... so many wonderful choices!!
While all the staff provided top class service, we would like to highlight a few individuals for a special mention. Our room attendant, Mahish was fantastic. He was always helpful, friendly and efficient and provided flower and towel creations on a daily basis.
Kasun in reception also stood out by giving excellent service. Always helpful & friendly and often going the extra mile in ensuring we were looked after.
While the hotel was well located for trips out (we had 4 days out on trips) and the local town, Kalutara was well worth visit, we also spent a good deal of time using the pool. The pool attendants were brilliant. Nimal & Priyantha were lovely people, always helpful and attentive.

The booking process was smooth, and I did it online. They have a pretty functional web site and are very responsive with the phone.

Location
It's located in Thissamaharama away from the clutter of the city in a very quiet environment. Perfect place for a relaxing stay.

Hotel
The front of the hotel just faces the main road and looks quite ordinary but don’t let the looks from the front deceive you. The back of the hotel is totally different from the front. It looks over pure greenery of the grass covered open area and the paddy field. The paddy was still young, so it had brilliant green which was soothing for the eyes. In between there is a nice pond which attracts birds. The pool is also situated in the garden overlooking the paddy field, which is quite nice.

Accommodation
We booked a triple room on half board basis. Our room was on the upper floor next to the stairway leading up to the garden. The room is spacious but not the largest in the class, very clean, and it has a private balcony with a breathtaking view of the green paddy fields and the garden. Great place to read a book and relax while zipping tea. The room consists of all the basic facilities including TV, sofa, safe etc… Also, it had tea making facilities. The only negative point I had with the room is its bathroom. It’s a bit cramped and the door of the bathroom cubical was hitting the shower head which misaligns it. And the showerhead is too far for a short person to adjust. Though it’s not a dealbreaker it was a bit inconvenient. But it had all the toiletries.  The beds were very comfy and overall, I am happy with the room though I had some negatives on the bathroom.

Food
We had dinner and breakfast from the hotel. Both were offered as buffets. The spread was relatively small but quite sufficient to fill you up. It was just right for us, and we loved it. The service received during meals was great. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful. 

Service
We received great service from the hotel staff. The staff was extremely friendly and quite happy to respond to our requests and was ready to provide a detailed explanation of the aspects of the hotel when we had questions. Loved the great service from the friendly staff.

The hotel offers some excursions like safaris, but we didn’t took part because we came there to have a relaxing time which we did.

Overall, we loved the stay at the hotel. It's an excellent place for families or groups of friends to have a relaxing time with some safari adventures.","Comfortable stay with friendly service...","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1576453-r1011866025-Kithala_Resort_Thema_Collection-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

I stayed here for two nights and slept very well both nights. The room was spacious and clean, and the food is surprisingly good, compared with a standard hotel buffet. The staff were all extremely friendly, which to some extent may be an institutional policy since EVERYBODY goes out of their way to say hello/good morning, which was much appreciated. However it went beyond this. After learning that I felt unwell, one guy working in the restaurant called Chaminda went out of his way to find off-menu Sri Lankan remedies (such as lime juice) that would help me feel better. While the pool is nice and it's generally a good place that I would recommend, it was this kind of proactive kindness that made me feel really good about my stay. Thank you brother Chaminda! The only small downside is that when we were checking out, a few minutes before settling our final bill we put our own suitcases in our car in preparation to leave instead of asking a porter, and the security man from the front desk suspiciously came over to our room/car as though he thought we were planning to make off without payment, which was unnecessary. Otherwise this place is amazing and I would definitely stay here again!","Extremely comfortable and friendly","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r1015996760-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

This was not my first visit, and every time I return, I’m reminded why I choose this property — the exceptional service and genuine hospitality that goes above and beyond expectations.

From the front desk and concierge to the room service and Flow restaurant staff, the level of professionalism, courtesy, and care is truly world-class. Every interaction I had during my stay was with someone who was not just doing a job, but clearly committed to creating a memorable experience for guests.

The staff at all levels are courteous, helpful, and pleasant — real ambassadors of Hilton’s service excellence. Their dedication to guest satisfaction is evident in every detail, and they truly uphold the highest standards that the Hilton brand is known for. Without a doubt, the people here are Hilton Colombo Residences’ greatest asset.

I would like to take a moment to personally acknowledge a few team members who stood out during this stay: Vinya, Jinanjali, Manodya, Tharaka, Travene, Dasantha, Denuvan, Chanthula — and especially Chef Rohan, whose warmth and culinary expertise added a special touch to my experience. There are certainly many more who contributed to making my stay exceptional — these are just the names I happened to catch.

To the entire team at Hilton Colombo Residences: thank you once again for a fantastic stay. I look forward to returning soon.","A Consistently Outstanding Experience at Hilton Colombo Residences","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r1001779545-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

As a Diamond member, this remains my top choice for accommodation. During my recent stay, Sabarishna from housekeeping went above and beyond—his service was outstanding. Additionally, many other staff members have consistently delivered top-notch hospitality, making each stay truly enjoyable.

However, the security staff remains a major disappointment. Despite my previous complaints, their service standards are well below expectations. I have never encountered such arrogance at a Hilton property. Today, I once again had to report an incident to the front office after being obstructed on my way to my room while using the digital key. Their attitude and lack of professionalism are unacceptable and do not align with the otherwise excellent service provided by the rest of the team.

Overall, while the hospitality from most of the staff is impeccable, the experience is tarnished by the unprofessional behavior of the security personnel.

I truly enjoyed every moment. All the staff were incredibly friendly, respectful, and helpful — always smiling and easy to communicate with. The food was delicious and varied, and everything was very clean.

The room was spacious, spotless, and super comfortable. It had a fridge, great air conditioning, and was well-organized to make you feel right at home. The view from the room was absolutely stunning — like living inside a painting, whether from the balcony or through the window.

One of the highlights of the trip was the boat safari — we saw crocodiles up close, water buffalo, exotic birds, and even bats hanging in the trees! It was such a magical and smooth experience, perfectly arranged and timed.

Another unforgettable feature was the swing they have at the hotel — it’s literally suspended between the hotel and the sea, and as you swing, you feel like you’re flying between the two worlds. It was such a peaceful and thrilling experience at the same time!

From check-in to check-out, everything was seamless and smooth. Big thanks to the whole team for making this stay truly unforgettable. I would definitely love to come back again!

An essential part of the experience is the extremely attentive and helpful hotel staff! We spent a lot of time enjoying the private plunge pool. Two of the bedrooms have attached bathrooms, AC and are luxurious. The third one is also beautiful and cozy but can’t be cooled down as well as the two others. Breakfast was delicious and there are differen options to choose from. Some things that are good to note: 1) There are no restaurants or bars nearby but there’s no need for them since the hotel restaurant serves excellent food. They often ask you to book lunch and dinner in advance. If you wish to try some other restaurants in Negombo, Pick Me app works well and also the hotel staff helps to book tuktuks, taxis, and any other trips. 2) The nearby beach is not suitable for swimming. However, we walked there and watched birds and saw some local fishermen drying fish. We also found the walk through the local neighborhood interesting. 3) There is a church on the other side of the river and some religious music can be heard in the villa but we liked it. The atmosphere of Waterland is fascinating in many ways and we already miss that. We will definitely be back if we ever have the chance to visit Sri Lanka again!","A perfectly relaxing visit in a special atmosphere!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r995147053-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

What a hidden gem! I love it when I stay somewhere that totally exceeds my expectations, and this place ticks every box and more. The MOST comfortable bed I have ever slept on (in over 30yrs of travel), stunning views, rooms, service and attention to detail. My friends and I stayed in The Peacock Villa, a split level two bed, with a triangular private pool (deceptively large) overlooking the river, for two nights after a long journey out to Sri Lanka from the UK. It was the perfect spot to decompress for a couple of days. Nothing was too much effort for the staff, from getting our room ready early after a long journey, to organising tuk tuks (big shout out to Nicolas and Sunni who ferried us around multiple times!) to arranging a rover boat cruise (a must) and talking us through the breakfast menu! The local resteraunts are great value and catered well for our less spicy European taste buds. I'd recommend a resteraunt called Toro for a good all rounder, and some great live music. The fish market in negombo is worth a visit (via tuk tuk, which are plentiful and inexpensive, however I would recommend using the same drivers and contacting them by WhatsApp, or being firm on the rate prior to the journey if flagged down). We had no issue paying US dollars or rupees, but found the gold shops gave the best rate changing GBP into local currency.
Wouldn't hesitate to stay again, was really quite spectacular. And watching the fireflies dance over the pool on the last evening was something I will cherish. If you follow the road from the hotel to the right, a 10 min walk will take you down to the beach/estuary where you will get a wonderful sunset/sunrise view.","Superb","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r995085368-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

It's good to hear that you enjoyed the cozy feel, the villa, the luxury of a private pool.  The private pool is indeed one of the defining features of a stay at Waterland.

The menu at Waterland is quite limited.  This allows us to do lots of live action cooking with fresh ingredients and to ensure that what we serve is special.  It's gratifying to hear that you appreciated the range of the menu and the local sourcing of the ingredients. 🍽️

You will not find a fresher cup of coffee anywhere on the island.  The coffee is grown locally and roasted and ground on site.

Your suggestion that guests explore the grounds is excellent.  The garden is the pet project of the manager and he and the staff have done a marvelous job of transforming a coconut plantation into a tropical oasis.  In addition to the beauty of the garden, the garden offers a chance to see how different fruits, herbs, and spices are grown.

Your kind words about the staff are most appreciated.  The staff are professional to be sure, but it their warmth and gentle personalities that really stand out. 

Thank you for recommending Waterland so highly and for taking the time to write such a lovely review. 🙏

Bei der ersten Reise im September 2024 wohnten wir in Bentota. 
Unsere zweite Reise nach Sri Lanka (April) hat uns nach Kalutara geführt in das Royal Palms Beach - volle Empfehlung ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - sehr gepflegte Anlage, nettes Personal, saubere Zimmer, großer Pool, weitläufige Liegewiesen, super leckeres Essen und man ist schnell im Ort - wir haben unseren Urlaub hier genossen. Der fehlende Strand hat uns nicht gestört, da man zu dieser Jahreszeit wegen der Strömung eh nicht baden konnte, den Strandspaziergang konnte man ca. 100 m weiter oder bei Ausflügen nachholen.
Touren - Wir hatten von zu Hause aus vorher einen Guide in der Nähe des Hotels gesucht und mit Kasun’s „Darshana Lanka Tours“ einen Volltreffer gelandet. Alle Touren wurden nach unseren Wünschen angepasst (da wir ja schon vieles gesehen hatten - mit den Veranstaltern kommst du eben mehrmals in die Kräutergärten); unterwegs gab es Empfehlungen und auf unseren Wunsch Essen in lokalen Restaurants; die Zeiten richteten sich nach unseren Wünschen (wenn wir bleiben wollten, blieben wir eben länger); notfalls wurde die Tour angepasst; Kasun begleitet die Touren in Englisch, da wir nicht alle gut englisch sprechen/verstehen (wir waren zu viert unterwegs), haben wir natürlich einen deutsch sprechenden Reiseleiter bekommen; die Fahrer waren alle sicher unterwegs und vieles mehr - alle Ausflüge waren ein Erlebnis 👍🥰
Und wir hatten nicht nur einen Reiseveranstalter gefunden, sondern eine gastfreundliche, liebenswerte Familie kennengelernt. Im heimischen Garten haben wir zusammen Tee geschlürft, die Anpflanzungen erkundet und probiert, frische Kokosnuss geerntet, getrunken und gegessen und eine schöne Zeit verbracht. Und bei Papa gab es tolle ayurvedische Massagen. Es war eine neue Erfahrung und gut für die Gesundheit.🤗🍀","Volle Erholung mit vielen persönlichen Ausflügen","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r1005678596-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The choice of food in the main restaurant was very good and there was always a good selection of local dishes; although we had to be careful about spiciness on some of them. The delicious desserts were mainly European style and fresh fruit.

The standard of our room was very good. It was large, clean and cleaned daily. Our room 130 was on the ground floor with a balcony and a view of the pool and the sea. 

There were never any problems with sunbeds and the pool staff were always helpful and made sure you had a sunbed of your choice. The pool was beautiful and maintained to a high standard. The pool bar was an added bonus.

 Buffet food was delicious and had a good selection daily even though 2 of us were vegetarian, never had an issue. Deserts are to die for. Cocktails are very basic and not much choice, but again knew this on booking and found drinks to enjoy. 

All the staff were polite and friendly and had no issues. I did see some guests being rude to them, but these guests appeared to have no manners for guests also. The staff dealt with them very politely and professionally. The guests are multi cultural, which is great to see and to speak to them 

Check in and out was quick and easy. The only issue I would mention is that my pick up wasn't till 5pm and they are strict with no food or drink inclusive package  from 12. 

The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels offered daily. On my birthday I had a towel elephant and a happy birthday in the room, which was a very nice thought . The room was kept at a good temperature and the bathroom was basic, but had what was needed. Our room was near the railway track and this was not an issue. Didn't wake us up and when heard, it was only for a few seconds. 

Booked a 2 day trip to Ella and Kandy with the mercury rep this was £270 and included the hotel stay in Ella. ( This includes train and safari). Good value and 2 very long days as early starts. The hotel supplied a packed breakfast.

The pool was kept clean and there were plenty of sun loungers, again the pool staff were great and put a towel out for you . 

There is a bar above the restaurant, which is comfortable and has a band in, It would be nice to see some Sri Lanka dancers or music etc, in the evening.  The gym was also cool and had enough equipment for a work out. 

Do read on booking that there is no beach, but it was still lovely to see and hear the sea. Also 1 glass of wine at lunch and dinner only. I had read  this on booking so it wasn't an issue.as saw several guests complaining about these.

Overall one of the best hotels U have stayed in and hope to return one day.

Pros

Staff on arrival were amazing.... Drink and flannel to cool is down.  Always polite, well spoken and helpful.

Room was large with beautiful view over pool, grounds and the sea.
Bed comfortable (see cons) with lovely soft pillows
Bathroom, small but everything clean and refreshed daily.

Grounds immaculate.

Pool was amazing.... Swim up bar, what can I say ... And the selection of AI cocktails were perfectly blended by great staff..

Plenty of sunbeds under brollies or palm trees.

Had a problem with Aircon.... Sorted within 5 mins..... Again great staff service

Food - I can't even put into words my feelings on the food..... AMAZING.., I only ate the Sri Lanka food and it never failed to satisfy..... 

Cons - these are cosmetic but should be improved.

Bedroom, 
Twin room beds were comfortable BUT adults should never be given single beds... I kept waking up ever time I turned over as bed was only fit for children.  Used to American queen beds in twin room.

Bathroom.
Was a bath with shower over. Large glass fitment meant getting in and out of bath difficult for older people and quite dangerous.

Overall fantastic hotel...","Royal Palms Resort","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r1001140819-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Tip the driver - it is hard and tiring work to bounce around driving the jeep all day looking for animals.
If we go again, we would do a half day safari and half day on a boat. That said, we saw a leopard and a bear (even more rare) only at the end of the day, so no regrets doing a 12 hour safari.

Tarique Omar’s passion remains and the service and comfort were excellent. Old staff like Das and the new GRO Lakshi made us all feel at home. The local cuisine was originality plus plus. We thoroughly enjoyed boatman Mubarak who knew exactly how to pole a boat taking us on a sunset boat ride in the backwaters. To see the sunset and the moon rising at the same time in utter tranquillity was stunning. Then the boat ride in the expansive Kala Oya estuary with its myriad of shorebirds in their thousands was dazzling, followed by a ride inside the mangroves and a visit to the great Baobab tree. While we could not spot the leopard in Wilpattu National Park we enjoyed the birdlife and landscape composed of Villus, the small natural lakes. 

“While I think of them they are growing rare
after the distances they have followed
all the way to the end for the first time
tracing a memory they did not have
until they set out to remember it
at an hour when all at once it was late
and newly silent and the white had turned
white around them then they rose in their choir
on a single note each of them alone
between the pull of the moon and the hummed
undertone of the earth below them
the glass curtains kept falling around them
as they flew in search of their place before
they were anywhere and storms winnowed them
they flew among the places with towers
and passed the tower lights where some vanished
with their long legs for wading in shadow
others were caught and stayed in the countries
of the nets and in the lands of lime twigs
some fastened and after the countries of
guns at first light fewer of them than I
remember would be here to recognize
the light of late summer when they found it
playing with darkness along the wet sand”

We enjoyed our visit overall and thanks to the acting manager Laksy who looked after us well as the manager Tarique was away for most of our stay.
The accommodation is somewhat basic being in a well converted container but don't be put off as everything works fine although it's not large.  You get what you pay for.
The food was fine and we had no complaints on that score.
Our real disappointment was the full day safari. This was organised by Backwaters. Our driver/guide had very limited English and we learnt little from him although he tried hard. Matters weren't improved by his being in a large cab with us sitting in the open back. So he had to lean out of his window to communicate with us! If we had known his limitations we would have taken our usual driver with us and the experience would have been completely different.
On the first evening we did a river trip which was fine as we insisted on an English speaking waiter coming with us as the boat driver wasn't going to be able to do more than point at the birds!
On our second full day we used our usual driver for birdwatching etc. There are so many species in the area.
Later in our holiday we met another couple who had a similar safari experience so it clearly wasn't a one-off.
A shame as otherwise we enjoyed our stay. We were somewhat disappointed by Tarique's reaction to our complaint when he returned the night before we departed.","Our stay spoilt by the full day safari","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12549273-d13356734-r943498750-The_Backwaters-Eluwankulam_North_Western_Province.html",

La communication avec Tarique était bonne en amont du séjour, permettant d’organiser notre séjour et nos activités avant notre arrivée, notamment le safari d’une journée (je recommande vivement une journée entière, c’est mon safari coup de cœur, nous avons pu voir de nombreux animaux de près et 2 léopards !) et une session de kayak sur la rivière. 

Concernant la chambre avec terrasse sur pilotis, le cadre est idyllique, perché dans les arbres, entouré du seul bruit de la nature environnante, une vraie bulle de sérénité ! Les lieux étaient très propres et agréables. L’équipement nécessaire est disponible, sur place ou sur demande. Concernant les prises, certaines sont britanniques et d’autres indiennes donc le choix est là selon votre adaptateur. Un bémol serait le confort du lit, un vrai sommier serait nécessaire pour le confort de tous. Toutefois, tout le reste était largement supérieur à ce point ce qui a permis d’oublier cet inconfort. 

Les parties communes sont très relax, permettant de prendre du temps de détente dans un environnement naturel et préservé. Les petites citations sur la nature et la balade en bord de rivière et forêt avoisinante sont vraiment sympa. Il y a également de belles espèces d’oiseau à observer sur le bord de rivière (martin pêcheurs, aigles, paons …). 

La cuisine est très bonne, nous avons pris plaisir à prendre notre petit-déjeuner et diner à l’hôtel. Le personnel est également très gentil et serviable, nous avons fortement apprécié leur disponibilité et professionnalisme. Je remercie tout particulièrement Tarique pour notre dernier échange sur les oiseaux et sa délicate attention ornithologique qui m’a beaucoup touché 😊. 

Un point à mettre en avant est la démarche écoresponsable de l’hôtel. Cet aspect n’est pas assez mis en avant lors de la réservation donc j’ai été très agréablement surprise de trouver un hôtel œuvrant tant à la préservation de la nature ! (eau filtrée, kit picnic zéro déchet, récupérations etc …). Cela m’aurait encouragé à réserver plus longtemps afin de faire d’autres activités qui sont organisées dans le plus grand respect de la nature (notamment les sorties découvertes des dauphins, j’ai découvert sur place que cela est effectué avec des pêcheurs et non des tours irrespectueux). Cela nous donnera une bonne excuse de revenir dans le futur 😉  Merci à toute l’équipe et au plaisir !","Excellent","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12549273-d13356734-r940991882-The_Backwaters-Eluwankulam_North_Western_Province.html",

There are lots of activities to choose from - we really enjoyed the jeep safaris in Wilpattu National Park, the sunset boat trip and taking a kayak out on the river where we saw masses of birds.  A really great stay - would highly recommend.","A wonderful relaxing stay","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12549273-d13356734-r940621104-The_Backwaters-Eluwankulam_North_Western_Province.html",

The staff welcomed us with genuine warmth and made sure every member of our family felt comfortable and cared for throughout our stay.

The hospitality was exceptional — the team was always friendly, attentive, and ready to assist, which made traveling with kids so much easier and stress-free. The hotel’s peaceful atmosphere and beautiful surroundings were perfect for a family getaway.

We also loved the food! The restaurant served a great variety of delicious western, indian and Sri Lankan dishes that everyone enjoyed, including options suitable for the little one. Every meal was fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.

All in all, Hotel Sigiriya offered us the perfect blend of comfort, excellent service, and tasty food. It truly made our family trip special. We would happily return and recommend it to other families visiting the area!","A Wonderful Family Stay at Hotel Sigiriya, Sri Lanka","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r1015370828-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

herzlichen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, Ihre Eindrücke Ihres erneuten Aufenthalts im Jetwing Blue mit uns zu teilen. Es freut uns außerordentlich, dass wir Sie auch bei dieser Reise wieder von unserem Haus überzeugen konnten.

Ein besonderes Dankeschön für Ihre wertschätzenden Worte über unsere Teammitglieder. Es erfüllt uns mit großer Freude zu hören, dass Sie sich durch Niroshan so herzlich betreut gefühlt haben. Sein Engagement, seine Freundlichkeit und sein hoher Anspruch an Servicequalität spiegeln genau die Werte wider, für die wir bei Jetwing stehen. Wir werden Ihr Lob mit großer Freude an ihn weitergeben.

Ebenso bedanken wir uns für die freundliche Erwähnung von Rochell und Benoit aus dem Guest Relations Team. Dass Sie sich durch sie nicht nur professionell, sondern auch persönlich gut aufgehoben fühlten – und sogar in Ihrer Muttersprache Benoit kommunizieren konnten – freut uns ganz besonders.

Ihre Anregung hinsichtlich einer festen Zuordnung von Roomboy und Servicekräften während des gesamten Aufenthalts nehmen wir gerne auf und prüfen dies im Rahmen unserer Qualitäts- und Serviceoptimierung.

Es war uns eine Ehre, Sie erneut bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen, und wir hoffen sehr, Sie bald wieder im Jetwing Blue willkommen zu heißen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

First and foremost, I am truly grateful to Mihirini who greeted me at the restaurant and went out of her way to ensure that I had an excellent stay. She also arranged an excursion to Pidurangala Rock and Sigiriya Rock. As I was going for a sunrise hike, she arranged a packed breakfast for me to take which was such a kind and thoughtful gesture. 

The food at this hotel is outstanding! I especially loved the Nasi Goreng! The food selection was wonderful. There was a wide variety of Sri Lankan dishes and I particularly enjoyed the curry and dhal.  There were also a lot of Western options. The food was displayed beautifully each day, and the desserts are not to be missed! I found all of the restaurant staff to be kind, helpful and welcoming. I am especially grateful to Moksha who looked after me at the restaurant and also arranged a packed breakfast on the day that I was checking out.

The housekeeping staff were wonderful as well, especially Madusanka.

The atmosphere was very relaxing. It felt like a retreat with the spectacular infinity pool and the lush green hills and palm trees. I enjoyed watching the sunrise from the pool and the sunsets were just as fantastic!

I really loved that the staff wore traditional Sri Lankan clothing, it was a really beautiful touch.

The arrival, check in, check out and all interactions with staff were excellent, they really know how to make you feel welcome. The room we had was large, very comfortable, spotless with large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. So far, all very 5 star. However, i can't give 5/5 as although the dinner and breakfast had good variety and quality, it was all luke warm. None of it was hot and we were there at the start of dinner. Only having a buffet option for dining in guests is also quite poor for a 5 star hotel. As it is in Kandi, I suggest only going B&B.

I need to specifically acknowledge the FLOW restaurant staff, chef Rohan was outstanding and makes delicious meals with his crew. His talent to make diveryof meals to satisfy anyone from any continent is amazing. I think the Hilton is extremely lucky to have him as the main Chef- you can ask anything special and he will make sure you enjoy his culinary expertise. Stop by the Hopper station run by Janaka.
Rukmal, Raj, Bandara and Nirupika were really outstanding with their customer service to handle guests when the restaurant is fully packed. They greet you and provide everything possible to make you satisfied with the meals. The bar and the restaurant is led by Kasun and he makes sure everyone who comes to these places is satisfied and happy. Try the cocktails made by Hearth with his assistants Suranga and Pasindu. You will never, ever be disappointed. This is my place to stay for my future visits too. I highly recommend this place for anyone who travels to Sri Lanka.","If you go to Sri Lanka this is the place you stay","2024-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r987510916-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

It's marvelous to hear that you had such a relaxing and enjoyable stay after your long flight to Sri Lanka. 

Your review will help others make more informed choices about whether they want to stay at one of the high-rise hotels on the beach in Negombo or whether they want to have a more personal experience off the beaten track.
 
It's lovely of you to highlight some of the special features of a stay at Waterland including  the stunning terraces, the refreshing private plunge pools, the exotic setting, the luxurious rain showers, the combination of modern and heritage design, and the welcoming and helpful staff.

It’s fantastic that you had a chance to enjoy the pool at night – there’s something magical about swimming under the stars. 

Most travelers are now staying at Waterland for several days.  In addition to the billiards, massages, swimming, cooking classes, and photoshoots available on site, your review helpfully notes some other experiences for travelers to consider including a boat safari from our private dock, a visit to the nearby fish market, and exploring the neighborhood by bicycle.

It's wonderful to hear that you were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the cuisine.  The restaurant is fortunate to be led by a dynamic Executive Chef.  He reworked the menu in the summer.  The menu now focuses on live action cooking and highlights special dishes of Sri Lankan cooking,

How kind of you to remark that the photos do not do the property justice. There is a magical feeling at the property.  It is indeed difficult to capture that feeling in photos or video.

Many of our guests are coming to celebrate honeymoons, anniversaries, birthdays, and other special occasions.  It's been fun to develop romantic experiences including the floating breakfast and lunch, the romantic welcome with a heart-shaped platform, the boat safari, and the private dining.

Fresh lime juice drinks. Good location to explore",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed two weeks arranged via Tui. Tui was really helpful arranging two trips whilst we were there - a one day one and a two day overnight (in Ella). trips were long days but the hotel location worked well to cover all we visited.
We had a lovely welcome on arrival and a room looking over the sea and pool (302) on top floor. You can hear the trains but we love trains. We were not quite sure when we arrived at this 28 year old hotel what to think but it envelopes you in the warmth and friendliness of the staff. Clearly need for some room upgrades. The pool attendants have been with the hotel since it started (this is not a chain hotel so hence authentic and charming) and ensure everyone has towels and beds - they work really hard. Our room was clean and attended to promptly twice a day including amazing towel art creations!! We loved all the food - delicious curries lunch and supper with snacks morning and teatime if you are all inclusive. Gym is really well kitted out too. You can walk to local Keels supermarket easily to pick up any snacks etc and local gift shops nearby too.
We knew the beach had been washed away so not a problem for us as pool is good size. And also the one glass of wine restriction at meals - if you want more you can purchase however was good way of not drinking to excess!! Yoga sessions to be recommended 2-3 times a week if you like relaxing. We missed the cooking demonstration and kitchen tours due to our external trips. All the bar staff work hard - you can get drinks from pool bar and Cabana bar (latter good to watch sunsets) from 10 am. Their fresh lime and soda is addictive - all hand squeezed.
They also do pork bacon every morning which is unusual in this part of the world.
We weren’t keen on having to wear a green plastic wrist band throughout our stay. They don’t have herbal tea but will make you fresh ginger, lime, mint tea if you ask for it. 
The cashier service is really really efficient. - you can change larger notes to tip (that’s expected in Sri Lanka) and they changed English notes. The laundry service was exceptional and really reasonable - highly recommend.
Watch out for the local iguana family near the pool plus two baby turtles went the wrong way and were rescued. 
To conclude - not 5 star standard in facilities but has masses of character and the staff make it a lovely experience","Rustic charm","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r996726450-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

In my view it is certainly nowhere near 5 star standard, an average 4 star at best.   The hotel is located right next to the sea and not beach as described in other reviews.  We had a problem for the first 3 days as the television would not work despite 3 attempts by various members of staff to rectify the situation.  In the end, they did as I suggested and changed the tv and remote to give us a set that finally worked ! We understand the beach was washed away and now you certainly couldn’t swim immediately on the sea side of the surrounding fence as it was far too rough. The pool was perfect and meandered from the pool bar area, under a bridge to the other side of the hotel and was a great temperature and kept very clean by the hard working towel / sun bed guys. The hotel has a great reception and bar area with beautiful antique ornaments, furniture artefacts  and wall mounted old doors etc throughout. We were on all inclusive basis and whilst there was plenty of food to choose from I was very disappointed that the food was not kept hot in the serving containers.  This meant various dishes had been sat for a long time and were less than luke warm when serving yourself ! Not everyone closed the lids on dishes which meant the flies helping themselves to what was on offer, not a pretty sight.  Vegetarians were very well looked after with a good range of dishes, sadly the same can’t be said about meat eaters like myself.  Chicken used was always thighs / legs and overcooked both on the grill and in curried style dishes. It would have been nice to have had the opportunity to eat a chicken breast dish but it seems the hotel do not go to this expense. I queried this with the head chef one evening and he simply said “no problem, I will arrange a breast of chicken curry dish for you tomorrow night”.  This was not the point I was trying to make as I said this should be available for all diners without asking for it.  Soups and sweets were of excellent quality. The croutons placed next to the soup container was a haven for flies as it was left uncovered, I mentioned this to a member of staff on our 2nd day, but 7 days later the flies were still dining out on the croutons !  The staff here are very smartly presented and work very hard and interact with guests very well, the hotel is lucky to have such pleasant people working for them. Our room was well looked after and in good working, but noisy a/c.  Our room was located close to the ground floor plant room and this was very noisy with mechanical noises to be heard through the night. Also, first think in the morning there is a very strong smell of drains / discharging sewage in the same area. We had to place towels over the drain in our bathroom close the sink and bath plugs and place a towel at the bottom of our room door to keep the smells out, this needs to be addressed as it is a serious health hazard. I don’t think it fair that when dining in the Cabana restaurant that only 15% is deducted from the bill.  If this restaurant introduced a 50% reduction for this on all inclusive basis it would be full every night as the food was so much better than the nightly buffet. We passed by the Japanese restaurant a few times at night and there was hardly anyone in there. Surely it’s time to change this restaurant to perhaps a fusion Thai / Chinese restaurant in order to make it a viable success.
Sadly, a serious problem exists with vendors on the public side of the hotel fence. I refer not to the ladies selling sarongs and wraps etc, but the males who hang around and sell DRUGS to those who want them !!!!!  I had to tell a German guest that I had seen what he was doing and as he was smoking nearby, I told him to move and not smoke anywhere near me. The men selling drugs had plenty of customers as well, in my view, security should move them on or better still, call the police.  Based on the above, if I returned to the area I would choose to stay elsewhere","Nowhere near 5 star, but could be if problems address.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r996626407-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Wir hatten nur Frühstück gebucht, dieses war für uns völlig ausreichend. Es gibt einige Lokale in der näheren Umgebung wo man gut essen kann.
Unsere Ausflüge haben wir bei KRIS Lanka Tours gebucht, keine 50m rechts vom Hotel entfernt. Kris können wir nur wärmstens empfehlen. Kris spricht Deutsch und er richtet seine Touren nach den Wünschen seiner Gäste aus. Auch sorgt er immer für einen deutschsprachigen Begleiter, der Interessantes zu erzählen hat bei Besichtigungen von Tempeln, Botanischer Garten usw. 
Bucht man Touren, ist man immer alleine mit Kris und einem Fahrer. Das ist sehr angenehm, da man im Auto unterwegs ist und nicht im Reisebus.

The egg hoppers were a highlight as well as the stunning pool on the roof top. Highly recommend for families, supermarket Keels is very nice and just down the road with an atm outside and a small supermarket with pharmacy right next door to the hotel. Just one thing that might be helpful to know is to pack a flannel or two as it seems flannels aren’t a common item here but I imagine if you ask they will find one.

Nice food too. Only stayed for one night when staying nearby Yala National Park. We arrived and was given such a nice welcome. We were on a FB basis - the lunch was just simply amazing - such a big array of lovely local dishes! 

We originally had an issue with our room, as they put us in a tent even though we booked a normal room - apparently they told our tour company but they didn’t pass the message on and hotel was full! Eventually in the evening they gave us a room or else this review would be the opposite! As the tent was not nice at all! The room was excellent, great view and nice bathroom. 

Would recommend and stay again if on a short break however would not stay in the tent so avoid!","Great hotel","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1576453-r992976949-Kithala_Resort_Thema_Collection-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

After not liking the older version of rooms at the hotel, I was very excited to know that a newer line of rooms had opened in Dec of last year.

My first use of the room was in early March and I absolutely loved it, so much so, that I requested for the same during my next visit in March. Maleesha from the resv team so kindly moved all things possible to ensure I got a really good room and I wouldn't have gotten her help without Mihirini who deserves a separate paragraph for her service.

Everytime I saw Mihirini, she was on her feet doing her job. I'd go early for breakfast at 7ish and there she would be, engaging with guests and I would return back to the hotel well past 6pm and there she was still working away. I don't know how she does it but I do hope the hotel is valuing her as much as I'm sure the guests do. I for sure did.
The staff truly makes the stay so memorable. 

Minor things that were quickly fixed: Aircon system seemed iffy - however when we called maintenance, there was nothing wrong with it; The iron in the room wasn't working, which they replaced with a new one. Menu needs to be changed - the pastas weren't available during my visit early in March and then my second time in March as well. It should be off the list if it's not available, but that's just my opinion. I must say, I didn't raise this issue with the staff despite them asking me if there was anything wrong, because I didn't think it was big enough to complain on.

Shoutout to Malindu at the restaurant for constantly being on the watch for guests needs including my own. I never went wanting anything because of their attention to detail.

If you're in town for business, request for a room from the Exec category. Its well maintained, clean. Service all round is amazing.","Amazing stuff, lovely new rooms","2025-03","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r1000083613-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed warmly and unexpectedly. The lobby was spacious and relatively quiet. Both the reception staff and security personnel were elegantly dressed, always smiling, and extremely polite.
Our room, 4009, was large, modern, and had a breathtaking view of the forest. It featured a beautifully designed king-size bed with a canopy and a very spacious terrace. The air conditioning was excellent and completely silent. The rooms were exceptionally well soundproofed.
The infinity pool, overlooking the forest, was incredibly relaxing—truly beyond words.
The restaurant was not crowded during breakfast and dinner, and the staff frequently checked to ensure we had everything we needed. The food selection catered to all tastes, and the appetizers and desserts were just as impressive. Live soft music during dinner created a delightful atmosphere.
The pricing for additional hotel services was very reasonable compared to other five-star hotels, with costs similar to those found in the city. Transfers between the hotel and downtown Kandy were simple and affordable.
I have never stayed in a hotel that was so family- and child-friendly. A special thanks to Chathurika, Methmi, Sivaraj and the rest of the staff whose names I, unfortunately, don’t remember.
One significant advantage was that, despite being well-known, this hotel was not one of those that constantly hosted large charter tour groups, ensuring a more peaceful experience.
As for minor drawbacks, the in-room safe wasn’t perfectly installed, there was no bathtub, and we noticed a few tiny insects in the room, though they weren’t bothersome—understandable given the hotel’s location. The hallways were slightly narrow, and navigating between different sections of the hotel was a bit complex, but these were insignificant compared to the hotel's overall exceptional atmosphere.
I truly hope they maintain this level of excellence, and we can’t wait to return—this time for our entire holiday!","Unbelievable","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r999406472-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

It was a very pleasant experience and made especially so by the staff - each and every one was extremely polite and solicitous.  I think the Golden Crown trains their staff very well - otherwise you would not see the consistency in service.

I must mention housekeeping as well - Erang from housekeeping went out of his way to promptly and graciously respond to our every need.

More than any other hotel where my group stayed in Srilanka this hotel had an enormous variety of dishes mainly at dinner time,  Such a choice I never saw in my entire life (and I am a tour guide from Israel). The food was delicious.
Only negative points about dinner (but I have to admit that it exists in all hotels) - waitrers and waitresses are ""jumping"" to take your plate 3 seconds after they see that you are done.

The room was lovely, with all the facilities you'd expect of a hotel of this type. There are lovely finishing touches in the hotel, such as traditional wall hangings in corridors. 
The outstanding feature of this hotel is its buffet, which was the biggest we've ever seen. Not only was there a huge range of cuisines available, but the quality of food was outstanding. Our regular server for breakfast and dinner was Ajith, who was the best and most attentive server you could wish for.

The hotel grounds is the thick forest and there are plenty of wildlife sightings while walking around. There is a stream along the hotel in which you can go for a sunset boat ride to enjoy the surroundings as well as encounter elephants. There are plenty of hideouts to read and relax and the hotel has made a great effort to ensure the visitors have sufficient space to do that.
The convertainer cabins were clean and spacious enough for two. The food was an interesting mix of Sri Lankan and South Indian cuisine and enjoyable. The kitchen staff puts in a great deal of effort to make it so esthetic.

With the small number of rooms here, you could always find a location to yourself.

We also loved that the staff arranged our safari, including a picnic breakfast and lunch.  They could not have made it any easier.

Its not near any noisy roads/traffic- you just hear the sounds of birds and frogs.
The room is clean, comfortable, generously sized with a balcony at the front and back. Although it is very humid and there is lots of water so I was worried about mosquitos.  There are lots of birds, lizards, monkeys around so its great to just sit and watch everything.
The bed, which had a mosquito net, was really comfortable and we slept so well. The only criticism would be that the lighting wasnt very strong and the light switches were wired in the most illogical way!
The hotel is pretty remote, we ate all our meals there- you would have needed a taxi/tuk tuk to take you to outside restaurants which the hotel would happily have arranged. The food was fine, we would have liked a bit more Sri Lankan food. We only found out that they had a Sri Lankan breakfast menu on the last day!
There is a quiet bar which only seemed to serve local lager and rather expensive (not very nice) wine. They had spirits on the menu but when I asked for a GnT they said they didn't have it.
They arranged transfers to Sigiriya rock, an elephant safari, Polannarua and also onto Kandy. They were very helpful and booked everything for us without any problems. All the staff were so friendly, polite and helpful.
On check-out we were given a questionnaire to fill out (in front of them) and asked if we had any suggestions/feedback. If they want honest feedback- give guests the questionnaire the day before check out to give you a chance to fill it out with more consideration- not when you are in a hurry and your taxi driver is waiting for you.","Beautiful, peaceful, remote, friendly staff","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r992753494-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

The accommodation met a solid 4-star standard with all the basic amenities you'd expect.
One minor inconvenience was that dental kits weren't provided in the room, but there was a helpful note instructing guests to call reception for any additional amenities needed - which we appreciated.
The pool area was definitely the highlight and most popular spot among guests, though it's quite obvious it needs some refurbishment to bring it up to current standards.
Food quality was generally good throughout our stay. However, we noticed that the buffet menu seemed identical to other Amaya hotels we've experienced, which felt a bit repetitive if you're familiar with the chain.
Overall, it's a reasonable choice for families looking for comfortable accommodation, but the property would benefit from some investment in updates and renovations to maintain its appeal.","Good Family Stay but Showing Its Age","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r1016632780-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The food at Palmstone Retreat was amazing. The kitchen staff were incredibly attentive to my specific requirements and prepared everything just as I requested. Mohammed in the restaurant was especially helpful with food and services, ensuring we had the best experience.

The rooms were exceptional, featuring a sauna bath and a heated pool—an experience we had never had before.

The best part, though, was the staff, especially Indunil. He was incredibly kind, taking us to a waterfall and even providing life jackets for us.

However, we were taken care of perfectly! Indunil took the time to take our 12 year old son to the river to have some private canyoning fun: jumping of rocks into the river, sliding from a natural slide! He really made our sons (and ours) day! Thanks again Indunil!

In the evening we were treated to a superb dinner, again in a perfect setting surrounded by the jungle and its relaxing sounds. 

The rooms are very spacious, perfectly clean and facing the river. Being a family, we had interconnecting rooms which was great. 

Breakfast again was fantastic, absolutely a joy to start the day. Big complements to the chef and his team!

Being in the middle of the jungle, expect the WiFi to be slow (you might want to warn your kids ;) ) And as I mentioned before, if possible I would really recommend at least a two night stay.

What a truly wonderful review!  We are absolutely thrilled to hear that Cinnamon Village was a ""tranquil paradise"" for your anniversary celebration.

It warms our hearts to know that from the moment you booked to your check-out, we did not disappoint. We are particularly proud that our team, especially Mr. Janaka, our F&B Manager, and his exceptional staff—Wimale, Saranga, Oshadi, and Chamal—made such a significant impact on your stay with their attentiveness, graciousness, and kindness. It's fantastic to hear you felt at home rather than just in a hotel.

Your recognition of our team's true spirit of hospitality, extending to housekeeping, reception, the pool attendant, and overall service, means the world to us. We agree that our sprawling gardens and beautiful views contribute to making Cinnamon Village a true paradise for families.

We can't wait to welcome you and your family back for another unforgettable stay!

We stayed on a Half Board package in a garden view room, and every aspect of our stay exceeded expectations.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed with cold towels and a refreshing drink. The check-in was smooth, and the staff made us feel relaxed and cared for right away.

The location is breathtaking, set along the lake with beautiful views and a calm, nature-filled atmosphere. Our room was clean, cozy, and surrounded by greenery — ideal for a peaceful escape.

The dining experience was a major highlight. Every single dish was amazing — fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Dinner included a fantastic live pasta counter and an excellent cold section, while breakfast featured a rich local Sri Lankan section, wide international variety, and a bakery corner with fresh selections. A big thank you to Head Chef Perera for such an impressive and thoughtful spread.

What made the dining experience even more special was the service from Saranga. We were fortunate to have him serve us at both dinner and breakfast. He was exceptionally attentive, kind, and genuinely passionate about guest satisfaction. His warm personality and professional approach truly stood out — he made us feel welcome, remembered small details, and took care of us with such sincerity. we were honestly impressed by his service — he is a true gem in the team.

We also visited the bar, which had a lovely, relaxing vibe. Nadishan served us and was equally warm and friendly, engaging us in pleasant conversation while ensuring we had a great time.

The pool area was another highlight — calm, clean, and surrounded by nature, perfect for cooling off and unwinding.

The restaurant was the highlight of our stay. The food was delicious!! We went on a busy weekend so it was fully booked!! The food was so popular that it did run out but the staff kept bringing out more and more! We have to thank the restaurant especially as we had a little one who is 9 months. The restaurant made meals for the baby upon request (mashed veg, yogurt, mashed potato, fruits, oats) and were very accommodating! They always enquired and ensured the baby had enough food!

My wife and I decided to visit the Seerock hotel, initially we were hesitant about our choice and after going through so many reviews and videos of this place, we thought of giving it a shot.

My oh my, It was the best 4 days. Where should i start from, We loved the Hotel's architecture and the Superior King Deluxe room we stayed was beautiful with an added Jacuzzi bath . The Seerock Team was very kind to us and they pampered us throughout our trip. We got a pretty good deal with Feelo which came with Fullboard and a free Safari ride. The food was delicious , Kudos to the Chef and the Team. As a whole, It was one of the best trip we had and will recommend it to our family, friends and colleagues!","Trip like no other!","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r956782790-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

It was a one of the relaxed weekends i had in a while.  I am so greatful to have stayed in Seerock which was a amazing little hotel with outstanding service to be offered. Away from city in the midst of total quietness is what anyone would ask for. 

Whoever read this review please feel free to check it out . I can 100% vouch for it.  

- Location - Easy to get by via Habarana. Once you are at Habarana you can reach the hotel via Tuk Tuk. Make sure to use Pick Me (Similar as Uber). Or you could even arrange a pick through the hotel who are happy to do the needful. 

Hotel is close to Sigiriya and Pidurangala as well which is a plus

Hotel was kind enough to arrange a Safari at Hurulu Park where we were lucky to see some Elephants at their own habitat. Tharanga (Safari Driver) was very well aware where to go so we would have the best experience. 

- First impression - We were welcomed by Shehara (Front Desk) witha big smile . Welcome drinks were offered & check in was pretty quick. 

- Room - A well maintained,  clean & luxurious little room with a  Jacuzzi built in . Belive me it was a perfect fit and its  suited for a family as well. 

- Food & Service- Chef Renuka and team are gifted with amazing skillset. Every dish they offered us was out of the world. 

Special shoutout to Daminda and Krishantha who served us through the stay was always happy to make sure we enjoyed each meal. 

Thank you Seerock The Kings Domain for the outstanding hospitality. This is the least I could do for the hospitality you offered. Looking for to see you next year.","Habarana's best place to be at (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r951567319-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

L'hotel confina con la giungla ed è formato da un corpo centrale e alcuni bungalows su palafitte. Le camere sono grandi, molto belle, ben arredate e con un condizionatore di qualità. Si trovano in palazzine intorno al corpo centrale, essendo un gruppo numeroso abbiamo occupato gran parte delle camere. Nulla da ridire per le camere, i problemi cominciano con le parti comuni che sembrano un pò lasciate andare e con poca manutenzione. Appena arrivati non si vedeva la piscina per l'erba alta, tagliata il giorno successivo. Nella sala ristorante fanno belle mostra le ventole vecchie ed arrugginite e i mobili che hanno sicuramente visto tempi migliori. Colazione molto scarsa per un hotel di qualità e siamo riusciti ad ottenere un servizio ragionevole ed in tempi normali solo dopo i primi due giorni. Detto questo, il Seerock rimane un ottimo hotel che con qualche piccolo accorgimento potrebbe mirare all'eccellenza.","Soggiorno al Seerock","2024-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r949019236-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

It was our wedding anniversary whilst we were away and after our dinner the staff brought out a cake for us and all the staff came to talk to us.

Thank you for making our stay a memorable one. I would highly recommend this hotel.","Beautiful hotel. Beautiful Location","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r952788896-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The small boutique hotel is located deep in the jungle, surrounded by the sights and sounds of the natural world.  A river runs over rocks at the back of the property with small waterfalls and pools to explore.  

Our room was amazing with picture windows onto the jungle, comfortable bed, plunge pool and sauna.

Whilst the location and facilities each deserve a five star rating it is the kind and attentive staff who added so much to our stay.  

In particular Mohammed Anfas ensure we had everything we needed and arranged for the chef Sivaganam to prepare delicious vegetarian Sri Lankan food that was probably the best ‘fine restaurant’ local food we had. 

The guide Sameera was also very kind and led us on a short hike to see and swim in a nearby waterfall and also took me on an early morning bird watching walk and trip to the nearby Belilena cave.    …. all highly recommended.","Luxurious jungle experience","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r945556104-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

You’ll find this small and lovely little hotel deep in the rainforest by a beautiful river. The rooms are spacious, modern and tastefully decorated. We had a steam room in our room and a hot tub on the deck. But what makes Palmstone so special is the wonderful staff and the incredible food! The brand new chef goes above and beyond. He is so excited to make food you’ll love. Even our 15 year old son, who’s normally not very adventurous with food, loved the food. The friendly guide, Sameera, took us up to a gorgeous waterfall the first day where we could swim. We did river rafting one day which was nice but the water was low. Some fun rapids but mostly a beautiful run down the river. Our third day we went abseiling which was the highlight of the trip to the Kithulgala area. The trip up the mountain in a jeep on beyond bad roads was an experience in of itself. Driving by  little mountain villages and tea plantations, our guide Bobby took us to the most gorgeous 90 foot waterfall. Repelling down this spectacular waterfall is not to be missed!!

This place is such an eye-pleaser as there's ample of greenery all around you and the sound of continuous flowing water from the river beside is just a cherry on top! It is about 5-6 kms from the main road and the hotel provides transportation if needed as not all vehicles can make it to the top due to poor road conditions. The hotel is wonderfully maintained and we loved our room (Araliya suite). All-day heated plunge pool, private access to the river and a steam room made our suite all the more interesting! Their food is quite good and the chef is flexible enough to prepare food of you choice (depending on the crowd, of course). We did a hike to the Manna Kathi waterfall from the hotel itself and Sameera, from the hotel, guided us. Therefore, special thanks to him. The overall hike took about 1 hour. The overall service of the hotel is excellent as everyone is very friendly and helpful. We would like to especially thank the chef and Mohommed for the great hospitality through-out.

From tips to travel around to any help needed at the hotel, he was at our service to improve our stay. The room looked amazing and was very well maintained. Unlike other hotels, the room was perfect and clean. 

The best of all was the food. Delicious authentic food. And some of the dishes were relatively new for us as they were special in the area sort of. When most hotels have the same dishes repeating, they had a variety of curries for each meal. Dishes were hardly repeated. Imantha & Malindu were at our service during meal times and was friendly and very professional. They made sure to get our feedback on every meal to make sure it was served best.

But the highlight for me was the incredible calmness of the environment. I’ve never experienced anything like it before – the peaceful ambiance, accompanied by the gentle sound of the nearby lake, created the most soothing atmosphere.

We note your suggestion about exploring the local restaurants and shops in Habarana. Indeed, the area offers a variety of dining and shopping experiences within walking distance. We will certainly keep this in mind as we provide information to future guests.

Thank you again for your feedback. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you and your family back to Sri Lanka in the future.

Probably the best all round offering for a family hotel that we stayed at whilst in Sri Lanka. The rooms were great, we slept very well. Hotel staff were lovely, bar service is slower than you would normally get in Europe or America, but we found this throughout Sri Lanka. We stayed half board - Food was above average. The hotel is definitely set up to cater for tour groups and there was a few there when we stayed, the restaurant is often packed as dinner opens (I suspect because a lot of people will get up very early to visit major cultural sites & return before lunchtime). In hindsight we probably should've explored the restaurants and shops more around Habarana -certainly there's lots around there & within walking distance. But more often than not we were thankful of being halfboard with a tired hangry child each evening. Food menu is a bit repetitive, but as it was the start of our tour we were very happy with rice & curry daily.","Great place to stay as a base for the cultural triangle","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r1003632062-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share such detailed feedback about your stay. We are delighted to hear that you found our buffet meals remarkable and that you appreciated the welcoming and hardworking nature of our restaurant staff. Your kind words about the general friendliness of Sri Lankans are also greatly appreciated.

I sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience you had with the Front of House middle manager upon your arrival. It is certainly not the impression we want to create, and I am concerned to hear that his disinterest and communication fell short of expectations. Please be assured that your comments regarding this will be taken very seriously and addressed internally. We highly value creating a positive first impression for all our guests.

We also appreciate your feedback on the rooms. We acknowledge that they may appear a bit tired and gloomy, and this is something we are continually reviewing as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our guest experience.

It is heartening to know that the latter part of your stay was much better and that you found our location great for exploring the local sights. We are glad you considered your stay to be good value overall.

Thank you again for your valuable feedback. We hope that despite the initial hiccup, you left with positive memories of your time here, and we would welcome the opportunity to provide you with an even better experience on any future visits.

Likewise the restaurant staff couldn't be more welcoming and hard working, like every other Sri Lankan we met, except one.... The 'Front of House' middle manager who 'welcomed us' was disinterested and clearly felt the task was below him as he rattled off the standard stuff about meals etc, none of which we understood. It seems pointless to us that you employ so many hardworking youngsters to run the bar and restaurant but keep on the older generation who take their jobs for granted and spoil the first few minutes of what will, eventually, be a memorable visit. This might sound like a one off rant, but the same thing happened to us in two other hotels, one a Cinnamon and one a high-end establishment. I think it time Sri-Lankan hotel high-ups took a long hard look at their jaded middle-mangers and put the bright youngsters up-front instead. I'm glad to say that the end of the stay was much better than the start. The location is great for the local sights. As has been said the rooms are a bit tired and perhaps a bit gloomy with small windows, but then again, you don't spend much time in the room, so why worry.

Thank you for your lovely review! We are delighted to hear you found our hotel perfectly located for Lion Rock and enjoyed the cottage-style rooms within our pretty grounds. It's also wonderful to know you appreciated the amenities, the lovely big bed, and especially the superb food, including our Sri Lankan selection and the hoppers with spicy curry – a must-try indeed! We're also glad you enjoyed the excellent coffee and the service and prices in our bar.

I sincerely apologize that the battery in your safe was not replaced despite your reminders. This is certainly not up to our standards, and I will follow up on this immediately to ensure such oversights do not happen again.

We also note your feedback regarding the air conditioning and are glad the fan provided sufficient comfort.

Thank you for mentioning Bussanka; we will be sure to recognize his hard work and dedication. We appreciate your recommendation and hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back for another enjoyable stay, where we will ensure all aspects of your experience are seamless.

It was truly a pleasure to welcome you and your family back to Habarana, especially after your honeymoon at Cinnamon Lodge 14 years ago! We are so thrilled that you chose to celebrate the Buddhist New Year festivities with us this time, accompanied by your three children.

We are also very happy that you found our breakfast and dinner buffets varied and excellent, and that you had a lovely reunion with some of the waiters at Cinnamon Lodge.

A special thank you for mentioning Mr. Thilina and his warmth and hospitality. We will certainly pass on your kind words to him.

It warms our hearts to hear that your children were sad to leave and wished for a longer stay. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming your entire family back to Habarana Village by Cinnamon for another memorable holiday in the future!

We booked the Eagle Lodge which was fantastic. An extra bed was provided with no fuss. The amenities in the room were excellent with everything being considered including mosquito netting. The rooms were cleaned to an excellent standard. The main pool was fantastic for relaxing in the hot afternoons. We also played some badminton by the lake.

The breakfast and dinner buffets were both varied and excellent. We walked round to the Lodge next door for a lovely reunion with some of the waiters from our honeymoon.

I have given 4 stars as parts of the hotel particularly the pool & rooms, are in need of some renovation and modernisation. Staff friendly and helpful but too quick to remove plates etc at meal times. A nice big lobby/bar area and spacious dining room. Dinner is a buffet for those like us on the half board option and very good also breakfast fine. Wine is very pricey so we stuck to Lion Beer. The hotel adjoins a lake which is scenic but be careful of mosquitoes. Rooms are serviced & cleaned daily, just a bit dated, but provided with the usual amenities such as toiletries, a fridge, a safe and tea coffee etc. Beds not as comfortable as our previous Cinammon hotel (Trinco Blu) as bit hard and mattresses thinner but adequate for our short break and very quiet at night. We had a lovely elephant towel art creation left on our bed :) Overall the rooms were more basic but we didn’t spend much time in them just for sleeping really so suitable for a short break/stopover.","Lakeside retreat","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r998123920-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

The resort is centred around the main restaurant which overlooks the infinity pool and the lake beyond that. The grounds around the hotel are well maintained and have an abundance of wildlife if you go and look for it, if you go out at sunrise there's a chance you will see the resident Kites fishing for breakfast.

The rooms are clusters of bungalows at the back of the main building which is a little untidy in comparison to the lakeside grounds. Ours was to the rear of the property which was more private to sit out on the patio area whereas some rooms were directly on the main walkway which didn’t offer any privacy at all. The rooms themselves are quite spacious and comfortable with a reasonable size bathroom.

We stayed half board and the food was ok with a choice of both local and western foods, service for drinks isn't great but it did depend on who was serving and where you were sat. During our stay there were quite a few group tours which made the evening meal a little chaotic due to the buffet layout and space.

The village is only a 5 minute walk away (up the drive and turn left) where there are a few shops and cafes. You can only buy alcohol at the ‘wine shop’ which is a little further past the minimarts where you will find beer is a fraction of the price it is at the hotel. If you do use the bar at the hotel be warned that there is additional tax to be paid when checking out which doesn’t appear on the bill you sign at the bar.","Nice location","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r998104823-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

We arrived with little knowledge of what to expect and we were pleasantly surprised at each turn. Our room which was plenty spacious and clean, was situated right by the river. We just walked down and got into the stream whenever we felt like it! It was so refreshing to just sit on a rock and let the water wash over us. 
When we returned to our room, the private heated, outdoor plunge pool was just decadent. As if this wasn’t enough, there was even a steam room in the bathroom! 
The room was well sealed so we enjoyed a relatively bug free stay considering we were in a rainforest. 

The staff were very friendly and seemed ever willing to accommodate any of our requests. A special thanks to chef Prabath who went out of his way to feed us what we’d like, to Indunil for his attentive service and Sameera for guiding us on the most amazing waterfall trek/swim. It was relatively sunny while we were there so thankfully we had no leech issues. I found the trek challenging enough to be enjoyable yet easy enough for my 5yr old. The waterfall and the large natural pool to swim in was sublime. Sameera carried life jackets for us so we could enjoy a super safe swim.

The key highlight is the amazing staff who work there. All of them were very supportive and attentive. Superb chef and his food was delicious. We loved all the meals he prepared. Sri Lanka, Italian, Arabic everything was perfect. Indunil, who took care of us at the restaurant was also very helpful. Thanks to everyone who made our stay memorable.

They organized a hike to belilena cave. Buddhika was our guide and he was really helpful. Especially to my little ones. Unfortunately we couldn't do the waterfall hike because of the rain. 

We highly recommend this hotel. Food, staff and location were among the best we have been in SL. Just note the climate, it's raining most of the time. So be prepared to enjoy the rain.
