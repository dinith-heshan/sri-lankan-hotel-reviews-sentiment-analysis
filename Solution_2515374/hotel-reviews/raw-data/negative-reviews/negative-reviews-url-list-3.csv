It would have been better if they had advertised themselves as an upscale Airbnb. If you rent the whole house for yourself with lesser staff in it, then there is possibility that one can enjoy this place more. 

There is a drawing room, which you can’t use because it is small and everybody uses the same for movements. There is a small veranda which is converted to restaurant and a small pool is also in the same courtyard. That means you can’t use this pool as there is no privacy at all. Our room was on the first floor. It was very beautiful and tastefully decorated. Bathroom area was also elaborated. However, functionality wise both were not okay. 

To add to our discomfort, there was a party in the evening, therefore, we couldn’t go to the dining area for dinner. They offered to arrange our dinner in the balcony area outside of our room but we declined. There was noise till late night due to the ongoing party. The manager apologised for the inconvenience however, we decided to check out next morning. 

Additionally, there is no assistance during 10 to 7 at night. Which is weird as it is very expensive place and yet they were not giving full services expected at this cost. 

We had breakfast in the morning which was good and checked out to Taj Samudra.

Thank you for your feedback. If we are to be very honest, we’re somewhat astonished by your comments and would like to respond in detail for the benefit of other readers.

To start off, the accommodation page on our website states… “Private and exclusive, the suites are located at the far ends of the hotel, with direct access onto the garden or balconies with beautiful views of the Indian Ocean.” Furthermore… “Three sets of picture windows look out over the garden, pool and ocean.”

The site you booked with, also mentions… “This room features a king size double bed, sitting area with a sofa, and either a veranda or two large private balconies overlooking the pool and the Indian Ocean.”

Therefore, we do feel the need to highlight that room number 1 (which you stayed in), does in fact have a sea view, as well as a pool and garden view (and can be identified in your attached picture). As a matter of fact, we’ve received frequent praise about this particular room with its direct access on to the garden.

Whilst we fully agree with you that the ground floor rooms have less privacy than the rooms on the upper floor, all our rooms have been fitted with sheer and blackout curtains in order to provide our guests with additional privacy. Hence why the manager recommended you to lower the curtains as he had no other alternative.

I hope you can understand how challenging it is to move guests around when the hotel is fully booked. Nonetheless, the team were able to allocate you another room on your last night. Sadly, this effort wasn’t enough.

We wish you had sent us a note, when booking, requesting for a room on the upper floor so we could have accommodated you accordingly.

Finally, all furnishings and amenities at Kumu are carefully chosen and quality checked before being placed in the room or public areas and hence can assure you that they are of good quality.

All the best,
Kumu Beach

The location is a stunning spot.  The pool area extremely relaxing and perfect spot to watch the sunset.

The service is extremely slow and the communication is awful.  All staff is very friendly, but could enhance their communication and timeliness.  The hotel only has 1 chef, so breakfast every morning took well over an hour to serve.  If you plan to have lunch or dinner at the hotel, you need to alert the chef ahead of time so he can prepare.  The hotel does not serve hard liquor because they do not have a liquor license.  So do not expect to be having any sunset cocktails.  The menu is only local beer and wine.  The rooms are nice and spacious, but lacked any amenities and toiletries that would be standard for a hotel of this nature.  The beds were very comfortable.  Lastly, although they claim to have a spa on site, they have no massage therapists.  You need to book at least a day in advance so they can bring in massage therapists from their sister hotels.  The massage experience was extremely disappointing and inappropriate.  I have lived in Asia for 5 years and regularly having massages throughout travels.  I have never felt so violated in my life while having a massage.

Overall, although an idyllic location with stunning views, I would not return to the hotel nor recommend it.","Idyllic Location...terrible stay","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r622253843-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly, I would like to share some relevant information about your wife’s masseuse. He has been in employment with us for over 3 years, and this was the first time we’ve received such a complaint. In fact, he is frequently praised for his wonderful treatments.

Nevertheless, your complaint is not something a hotel of our nature would take lightly, and as you are aware, the management of Kumu Beach conducted a thorough investigation via both our internal HR & legal team, as well as an external and impartial legal counsel, with the assistance of a renowned Spa Consultant.

We would also like to assure all readers that Kumu Beach has a zero tolerance policy for any misconduct from its staff. We continue to welcome guests with the genuine Sri Lankan hospitality we have become well known for, as the reviews on TripAdvisor suggest.

The reason for this was due to a completely inappropriate massage that my wife and another woman received at the hotel.  Please see below the email I have sent to the hotel detailing the incident.  

Dear Henry Fitch,
 

Thank you for your email requesting feedback on my wife and my time at Kumu Beach.  To be honest, I was in the midst of putting together some feedback.

 

There is one meaningful incident that I need to bring to light.  On Sunday September 30th 2018 my wife and a female friend that was also staying at the hotel had a Kumu Z Signature massage.  They had requested this the day before and were told that two female masseuses would be providing the service.  That morning it turned out rather to be one male masseuse and the ladies had their massages back-to-back.  All parties had no issue with a male masseuse providing the service.  My wife and I live in Singapore and have traveled extensively throughout South East Asia for the last 5 years and she has had both male and female masseuses.  There has never been an issue with male or female masseuses in our travels.  That is until our stay at Kumu Beach on September 30th.

 

After the massage my was wife was shaken by the inappropriate nature of the massage.  The male masseuse had crossed a line and made my wife feel very uncomfortable with how close he came to touching her genital area and the time he allocated to ""working"" on this area.  In addition, he did not ask her permission but just proceeded to massage her chest and in the process saw her exposed breasts.  My wife normally thoroughly enjoys massages but in this instance the male masseuse that Kumu Beach hired made her feel very uncomfortable and he crossed a line with how close he was to her genitals and the amount of time he elected to spend massaging this area.  She was shocked and did not immediately react but as she processed what had happened, a serious line was crossed.

 

I should note, that the other woman (our friend) in question that had the massage from the same male masseuse had a similar if not a worst experience.  Her boyfriend will be communicating with yourself or a colleague separately on her specific inappropriate incident.  

 

This incident is completely unacceptable.  We are both shocked that it happened, especially at what we thought was such a fine and well reviewed hotel.  Please note, the completely inappropriate incident was not a misunderstanding, not applying western standards to a Sri Lankan massage, or anything else that can explain away that the male masseuse crossed a serious line; not to just one woman but two women on September 30th.  

 

I trust that you will take this issue seriously.  It is regrettable that this incident happened as we enjoyed the hotel and the otherwise friendly service.  I will be posting reviews across various platforms as potential patrons should be aware that a simple massage could end up being very inappropriate at Kumu Beach.   

 

Sincerely,

Daniel W","Inappropriate Massage","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d12880550-r621712531-Kumu_Beach-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

We are concerned about your review and are very sorry that Stafford Bungalow fell short of your expectations.

What we strive to offer, is the experience in living in a Tea Planters Bungalow, in an era gone, with its luxury lifestyle and great cuisine. Being immersed in the middle of a working tea plantation, the activities are based on exploring the estate, along with the complimentary tea plantation walk every morning. An activities sheet is also kept in the room, to explore options of hiking, croquet, tennis and mini golf amongst others. The day visit to Nuwara Eliya and golf options there are also available.

On the food side, our practice is that the Chef suggests his special option for the evening meal which is usually a 4 course meal or local option and is open to individual guests preferences should they request.

For the Tea factory visit , we offer Pedro estate, a popular factory to visit, which is approx.15 kms from the bungalow and close to Nuwara Eliya. Our neighboring Tea Factory currently does not encourage tourists in.

We are concerned if we have communicated this to you well , at the Bungalow. We would most appreciate if you could give us more details to reservations@staffordbungalow so that we may enhance our services.

We thank you for your feedback.

We are concerned on the feedback of the overall cuisine experienced at the Bungalow. Whilst our experienced Chef and his team has always scored high accolades, we were sad to note your comments. 

We would like to understand the issues further and would appreciate if you could send us a note on reservations@staffordbungalow so that it would be helpful for us to understand this further.

The room was nice, comfortable and gave a homely feeling. What was expected to be a wonderful stay did not seem so with the unruly and grumpy service.
It was such a shame to see how the staff, not one but all just go about their work as if nobody cared for us. The cold shoulder and unwelcome vibe was all around and I hardly had any assistance. Surprising how they could not manage with just a few rooms and not many people staying over.
To add to our worries, the food too wasn’t ok and not much. One of the fellow guests mentioned how drastically the service changed from being all nice to all grumpy. Well, it looked as if the staff were mourning over a death and just did not give a damn if you ate or not.

Thank you for your positive comments on the location of Stafford Bungalow, the spaciousness of its rooms, the charm of the property and the gardens, along with the comments on the food and the great views. We are happy that you enjoyed the hikes around the plantation with our manager who has deep insights on the subject of tea. In particular, we truly appreciate your kind words about our wonderful team.

Please note that all of your concerns were addressed in full in July, immediately after you lodged your first complaint. As we take such issues extremely seriously, we proceeded to investigate the situation thoroughly and all findings were reported to you in a timely and comprehensive manner, as follows.

We apologise for the insufficient support given to you on guiding you and your driver to the location, and for you having to stay at the gate till our watcher arrived. We can understand how you'd feel after your journey to the tea plantations. We wish that you could have advised us on your 10th wedding anniversary, as we would have prepared something special to celebrate this milestone date. During our immediate follow up on your original complaint in July, we explained that we always serve the traditional high country aromatic fresh teas at Stafford. As you had specifically requested for a different type of tea, we made special arrangements to get this brew with tea bags to accommodate your request.

We were, and still are, rather surprised, however, with your criticism of the room cleanliness and infrastructure. As we noted, the restoration of this heritage bungalow was done very recently, with extensive upgrades. We have not had complaints of poor maintenance before, or since. Nevertheless the Manager has been spoken to, and will re-ensure a thorough room check is made before each guest's arrival. We thank you for your feedback.

This was an unusual situation and we could have attempted to resolve many of your concerns at the earliest. However, besides the mention of the unfortunate route direction, nothing else was brought to our attention during the period of your stay, which would indeed have ensured that the situation was rectified immediately.
We further regret that we could not accept your request of a full refund. However, we hope our gesture of a substantial rebate can be accepted with a spirit of goodwill. 
Then and now, we thank you for your feedback in helping us take our little piece of heaven to even greater heights, and look forward to welcoming you back soon.

After reading the many great reviews on Tripadvisor and on the Stafford website we chose the Stafford Bungalow. 

A few days prior to departure we emailed the Stafford Bungalow as it was our first time to Sri Lanka and wanted to get directions to the bungalow. . After a few days of no response we emailed again, but again no response. We simply requested a good map with written directions to the bungalow as a few people had mentioned the difficulty in finding the place. I finally got an email back telling me to follow the directions on the website, those were not very clear so I asked again for written directions. This made us a little nervous but we still hoped they would contact us before our arrival in Sri Lanka and we even gave our phone number. Sadly, they did not, so on our morning of arrival we called the bungalow direct to get driving directions, luckily we were able to get what we thought were good directions. We had a local driver so we set out to Nuwara Eliya. 

After six hours in the car we arrived in Nuwara Eliya, the roads are narrow but it was a great experience. There were no directions from here to Ragla, which is another one hour drive in the afternoon from Nuwara Eliya. We called the Bungalow and they guided us to Ragla. On arriving in Ragla we had to call again to get directions to find the Bungalow. They guided us through the village and told us we would be at the white gate in about three minutes. We arrived at the gate and no one was there to greet us, we waited almost ten minutes after ringing the bell until it was opened. It was not a nice greeting as they knew we were almost there. 

The driveway into the property was truly beautiful and when we got out of the car and walked into the beautifully manicured gardens which was set up for afternoon told, we were very happy that we had arrived in such a beautiful place and wonderful garden.
The staff took our bags and gave us cool towels, we quickly went to the bathroom to freshen up. 

Back to the beautiful garden with fabulous views over the tea terraces, where we eagerly awaiting our “High Tea”. Our disappointment when they produced an old metal teapot with the string of the teabag hanging over, the cups were not even cups they were mugs and cheap ones at that. The bites and cakes were very pleasant as were the staff, but truly not luxury as it is described. We chose a tea plantation and expected a real high tea experience, it was very much lacking.  I headed straight for the shower which was a disappointment, there were dead flies on the window sills and a few on the floor, it was obvious no one had been in the room for a few nights at least. After my shower I grabbed for a towel which turned out to be an old hard towel which exfoliated me just like sandpaper, again not luxury. I went and explained the towel situation and asked for new ones for my husband, I was told that was all they had. 

After finishing our tea in that beautiful setting we retired to our room to unpack and relax before dinner. The room was a good size which is one of the reasons we chose it. 

At dinner that evening the manager came to chat and welcome us, after listening to him tell us about all the great things about the Stafford bungalow and how it is so highly ranked on tripadvisor, he also informed us about the morning tea trails hike, which we gladly booked. When he had finished telling us how fabulous the place was, I mentioned the difficulty we had when I emailed and asked directions, I also told him that when we finally got a response to look on the website, I mentioned that was not very nice and also not very welcoming. He then told me that no one ever has any issues finding the bungalow and we were here now.  Not the way a luxury property treats it guests, when they try to make a suggestion to help other guests in the future. As we were finishing dinner another family arrived and sat next to us and they had the same complaint about the driving directions but sadly for them when they called during dinner time no one answered, so they arrived very late.

We retired to our room, which by now we realized was a very tired room. I know its Sri Lanka but luxury is not like this, I sat on the bed and the whole bed was held up on a plank of wood, which creaked when you sat on it. The mattress was very old and soft, but our greatest disappointment were the sheets, like old flannel with bobbly bits on and even holes and stains. It was a huge disappointment but what could we do this late at night after a long day of travelling. 

Next morning we awoke very early to go on the Tea Hike. The manager met with us in the garden and we were the only ones hiking that day. The hike is truly one of the best things about this place, wandering through the plantation and watching the pickers work and seeing this part of beautiful Sri Lanka. During the walk the manager was very friendly and told us his whole life story and how he got to run the Stafford, he was very pleasant so I brought up the issues with him. Firstly, how we had emailed seeking good directions and had no response for days and as first timers to Sri Lanka, we were a little concerned but then to get a response to tell us to look at the direction on the website which were not very good, further disappointment. I then explained that our driver had to call 6 times from Nurwara Eliya to get clear directions to the place. He did not show any empathy and again just told us that most people find it very easily as he put us in our place and continued on telling us about the plantation. He really did not want to hear any issues as he kept telling us how great the place was.

There are a few great things about this place, the gardens, the setting in a beautiful tea plantation and the rest of the staff were wonderful. Sadly, there are too many downsides, some I have mentioned already, let me explain the rest of our stay.  It is a very long drive from Colombo, next time we would take the train and just hire a driver from there, much easier as the roads are not great and sometimes very busy with traffic. The crusty towels stayed with us for most of our stay as did the holes in the old bed sheets. The flowers that were in our room died the second morning and were never replaced. The flies in the shower also stayed with us even after I mentioned about the cleanliness. On our final night the manager came to our table as he would not be there in the morning when we left, he said that we hoped we had a lovely stay and could give them a good write up on Tripadvisor. I again mentioned that none of our issues were resolved, and on that note he said good night as he had to rush.
We were left at a total loss and retired to our room, we put together an email to the agency we booked through highlighting the issues and retired to bed. Next morning some lovely fluffy towels arrived in our room and at breakfast I received an email fro the Stafford head office, who wanted to call me to get the issues resolved. We were not able to connect that day, but I sent all the details of our non luxury trip to them with back up photos. We were finally happy that someone was listening to us.

A few days later a director from the parent company called me, he had received a full copy of my email and the photographs that I enclosed. He was very nice and very empathetic, but he had an agenda, his greatest concern was that I would not post any negative message on tripadvisor and also not to post the pictures of the dead flowers in the bedroom, the dead flies and unclean room, the holes in the bed sheet and duvet, the unclean bath sink and soap dish, the area just outside the garden with the rubbish dump and the litter everywhere beyond the bungalow walls but still in their grounds. 

This property Is truly not luxury but has a beautiful garden and setting, in all there are many better places for a similar price or slightly higher that was true luxury we experienced for the rest of our stay in Sri Lanka","Not Luxury and not what others experience, a real disappointment","2016-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r427423645-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We love the bungalow, which is steeped in history, and the warm and friendly staff who received us when we arrived at 6pm in the evening.

What annoyed me greatly was my brief telephone exchange with the estate manager. I had called him because the bungalow staff refused to grant my driver accommodation for the night, neither were they willing to offer him a packed dinner. (Mind you we had arrived late in the evening and my driver was unlikely to find dinner by the time he drove out of Ragala, which was a 45-min drive from Nuwara Eliya.) I pointed out to the estate manager that Stafford's website has indicated that ""chauffeur guide/drivers: Accommodation and meals included"", and even sent him a print screen of the website. I demanded an explanation for the discrepancy between what the website promised and the treatment my driver was getting, but received no satisfactory answer. (At the point of writing, the estate manager still has not replied my email, but has altered his web page to delete the provision of drivers' accommodation.) This reeks of dishonesty.

If you are travelling with a chauffeur guide, my advice to you is to look for a hotel or bungalow in a more central location. Even if Stafford promises driver accommodation, don't take their word for it. You never know whether they can be trusted, or whether they will change their web page overnight.","Excellent hospitality, tainted by inflexible, dishonest, and rude estate manager","2016-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r415817415-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Nice natural setting but it was a major let down in many ways. Extremely limited food options even though the letter signed by the owner claims ""wide variety of Thai, Sri Lankan and other cuisine"" (have a copy of it). Run more like a boarding house where after 230pm, you have choice of a few basic snacks only and same applies for dinner. Since the place is away from it all, you are kind of stuck. When we complained, we were told this is how the boutique  hotels operate, first of a kind we have seen with this arrangement. So if you can survive with very limited  food options (2 for main courses) to eat with a set menu for set timings with limited choice for meals, then this is the perfect place for you. The pool was not clean and we did take some pictures with insects etc in it even though a daring lady took the plunge. The worst part was when you take a shower in the afternoon, you can surprise yourself with dirty, muddy water. When I saw the towel after taking the shower, i was shocked to see it all go orange. I went to the management office  and was calmly told by I think the owner himself  that there was some problem with copper or something similar in the tank and that it was just wrong timing of the day  for me to have taken shower. That says it all that the management is aware and it was not a surprise for them but they fail to do anything about it. A casual apology and an acknowledgment is not something you expect from a place that boasts itself on luxury. Second day, the room was full of bugs even though the service team came and promptly did their job.The property is also short on blankets and when we asked for an additional blanket for a family of 5, the last piece given was a rug with holes in it. Thats the most appalling thing I have ever seen. I will separately post the pictures of the pool, the orange towel/ water and the rug with holes in it which was claimed as a blanket. In summary, a pathetic experience, callous service in  palace that charges exorbitant money for nothing close to comfortable stay.","Deplorable experience","2016-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r361351342-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I am deeply saddened that you believe we have misled you – and other customers, in relation to our location.

At NO point, do we claim the hotel is on the beach.  On our home page we state quite clearly that you need transport to get to the beach or to Galle Fort.  We are in fact 15 minutes from the beach – 5kms as the crow flies – and not 30 minutes as you claim.
In addition, there is a Google map on our website showing the hotel’s location on the north side of Koggalla Lake – making it abundantly clear that we are not on the beach.
Out of the 140 odd images on our website, only three are of beaches in Sri Lanka  - as recommended by our webmaster, in order to give the guests an idea as to what they should expect on their holiday.

With regards to your comments about the breakfast, I am at a loss as to understand what you are complaining about. We offer our guests the choice of a full breakfast at the hotel, as well as a Sri Lankan style breakfast. Breakfast is included in the room rate, so I have no idea what the $40 is that you mention. I have checked your invoice and there is no “extra charge” for any breakfast.

Regarding your onward hotel, you had stated that you planned at stay at the Hilton in Colombo, as you had an early or late flight from the airport. We merely suggested you might like to stay at The Wallawwa, since the hotel is just 15 minutes from the airport, as opposed to the Hilton, which is roughly 50 minutes away. Added to which, many of our guests stay at the Wallawwa, and it comes highly recommended. We thought we were doing you a favour by recommending a stylish hotel that is of a similar standard to our own, and which is more conveniently located to the airport than one in central Colombo.  
You asked for a car and driver to take you from the hotel to The Wallawwa, with a stop in Galle. In fact, you had lunch in Galle and the driver had to wait for 3 hours before proceeding to The Walawwa. You were not charged any extra for the waiting time - just imagine if this had been a metered taxi! 

Electrical items here do go wrong with regular alacrity – and usually we can get these sorted out within a matter of a few minutes, hopefully minimizing any inconvenience to the guest. If you had a problem with the ac unit – why did you not mention this at the time? We could have happily sorted it out – the same goes for the wifi. This is a third world country, and although we do provide free wifi, sometimes the service is interrupted and there is not much we can do about it.

I feel they assume wealthy people do not care if they are cheated because they can afford it.  

Here are my top 3 lies: 

1. This hotel is 30 minutes drive from the ocean. Deceptive pictures on their website showing the beach and shoreline fooled us into thinking they were on the ocean.  We should have checked, obviously. I have to admit, I did not expect a hotel charging $500 a night would lie about its location by showing pictures from a different location.

2. Breakfast included - Oh, wait - the Sri Lankan Breakfast - not called breakfast I guess. It's not that I will miss $40 - I can certainly afford it - but I do not like being tricked. That is what they are into.

3. ""Oh you can stay at my friends place near the airport - only $200 US"" -  3a - place was not near the airport (of course their hotel is not near the ocean so I should have figured on that), 3b, they wanted to charge us $375 US (the owner gave us 15% off so that helped), and 3c, when we decided to take the KK car to a hotel that was actually near the airport (a 5 minute drive) he said he would charge us $45 for the extra trip - we turned around rather than give the KK owner another dollar. 

Who knows where this place got its reputation - but it will be losing it soon, I expect. The experience left us feeling that we had been dealing with a slimy guy who knows how to sneak a few extra bucks from customers already happy to pay $500 a night for a room nowhere near the ocean.

A few other things: AC control did not work (we heard other couples complained as well). Game boards are falling apart and scrabble pieces have some interesting replacement pieces. There is wifi and it is easy to connect to, but don't expect to download any files. I was unable to use Kayak to book a reservation which is why we were at the owner's mercy when he offered to find us a hotel ""closer"" to the airport.

I will say the pool is very nice, but nothing special.","Deceptive practives abound at this expensive hotel","2015-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r336195784-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly, may I say how saddened I was to read your review - not only because you have left KK with a sense of huge dis-satisfaction, but also because I am so surprised by your comments.

I have been through all the correspondence relating to your booking (2 brief emails) and have spoken to the staff, to find out how and why things went wrong with your stay here. 

We received two emails from Josh, firstly on the 3rd December saying that despite the fact you had booked the Tea Suite, you wished to change to the Garden Suite and the second email on December 31st, was about how to get to KK from your previous hotel. There is not ONE single mention that you are on your honeymoon.

Duminda, who was the duty manager when you checked in, has assured me that when he escorted you to your room, there was absolutely no mention from you that you were on your honeymoon. When you asked him about the Garden Suite, he said that he would check and when he got back to you, having shown the suite to you, you informed him that you were happy to stay in the Tea Suite. I am not sure why you had not been allocated the Garden Suite at the outset, that is our fault, and for which I do apologise. However, you were shown the Garden Suite shortly after arrival and given the option to move, but declined. 

You also claim that he told you that the hotel was full - that I do not believe he can have said, since there were in fact four other rooms vacant that particular night. 

I feel that I must defend my staff against the claims that you have made  - that they were unfriendly and that they did not understand spoken English. You only have to read the reviews from other guests to see the glowing comments about how friendly and welcoming the staff are at KK. Similarly we have only once had a complaint from a guest about a lack of understanding by a member of staff. 

With regards to charging for snacks in the Living Room before dinner, this has always been our custom, and nobody has complained before. For your information, our room rates do not go up to $700 as you claim - our most expensive suite is $530 at Christmas and New Year. Similarly we have always charged for a cappuccino or the like at breakfast, and I think you would find that most hotels have the same practice.

I feel it is a real shame that you did not express your views during your stay here - as far as we were aware, you were very happy with everything and we arranged for you to leave your bags in our shop whilst you waited to catch your train to Colombo. At the time you both showed your gratitude at the extra service we had provided. If you really were that unhappy, why did you not say anything whilst you were here, and we would have tried very hard to to rectify matters?

Again, I should like to say I am extremely sorry that you did not enjoy your time here, would like to take the opportunity of wishing you and your husband - whom I met just briefly - every happiness in your life together.

We stayed at five different hotels (a mixture of luxury and rugged) while we were in the country... and KK was our big splurge. The last two nights of our honeymoon were spent at this hotel and although our room was beautiful, it was far and away the least favorite part of our trip. Actually, it was the ONLY bad part of our trip! 

While we were in Sri Lanka, we were overwhelmed by the kindness and warmth of the people we met. Unfortunately, this was not the case at KK. 

We were met by the hotel manager, who was very cold and formal. We tried to chat with him and as we walked to the room, we mentioned that it was our Honeymoon. He then proceeded to scold us (literally) for not having told them this (which we HAD, in earlier emails to the hotel) and said that had the hotel known that it was our honeymoon, we would have been upgraded or gotten special treatment, but that since we hadn't given them notice, we wouldn't be getting anything. He then said that they hotel was fully booked (which was a lie) and said that because of that, we wouldn't be getting an upgrade. He then turned around and left. 

Please let me be clear, my husband and I didn't ASK for any upgrades or gifts, nor did we expect them. We did not receive any special treatment at any other hotels, nor did we care. But by telling us this (very rudely), it made us feel as though we had lost something and were getting the short end of the stick. It was a horrible first impression and made us feel as though this beautiful room, that we were spending a lot of money on, was not as special as we had thought. 

The service never warmed up from there. Although the Tea Room where we stayed was beautiful (which, as an interior designer, was a lot of fun)... I had specifically requested the Garden Suite. When I was surprised to be put in a different room, I was told that that the Garden Suite wasn't available for both nights. Since we didn't want to have to move back and forth from room to room, we said that the Tea Suite was fine.... then we discovered that we weren't given a double bed! The Tea Suite has two twin beds pushed together, with a king sized fitted sheet holding them together, and we kept falling through the crack in the middle during the night. It was the most uncomfortable night's sleep... and didn't exactly add to the romance of a honeymoon to have two twin beds. I'm not one to nit-pick, but that's pretty absurd. Since we had been told that the hotel was ""fully booked"" we didn't complain, because we thought that this bed was our only option. To top it off... NO ONE EVER STAYED IN THE GARDEN SUITE! It was another lie from the manager. 

Additionally, the staff spoke such poor english that it made ordering anything very difficult. This was very odd, as we had been camping in the jungle just days earlier, and took the local busses around the country. Almost every Sri Lankan we met spoke enough english to communicate at a higher level than at KK. 

The staff was also SO formal and distant that the hotel felt cold and very different from all the other places we stayed in Sri Lanka... but this formality was paired with an odd sense of being nickle-and-dimed for everything, which usually only comes with budget hotels. We enjoyed cocktails for an hour before dinner, but were not given any bar snacks (nuts,chips,pretzels) without being told that it would be an extra charge of 700rpd... and ordering a cappucino or latte at breakfast is an extra charge as well. 

I used to work for a hotel group that managed 5 star resorts around the world, and the idea of charging someone for bar snacks who is spending $350-$700/night on their room PLUS all of their meals, is literally unheard of. 

Nothing about the experience felt connected to the beautiful culture or country, since we weren't being embraced in the Sri Lankan way. This treatment wasn't simply because this was an ""upscale"" hotel. We stayed at Tintagel in Colombo, which was the same price point, and were overwhelmed by their warmth, hospitality and incredible generosity. 

Unfortunately, our last two nights of our honeymoon left a bad taste in our mouths. I wish that we had skipped KK and saved the money. Most of all, I wish that I could have spent the last nights of my honeymoon at one of the other heavenly hotels in Sri Lanka. I hate that our final hours were in such an artificial and unwelcoming resort environment.","Poor Service - Beautiful Decor","2014-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r191492137-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Whislt it was most unfortunate that the air conditioining units were not working in two rooms, we tried to resolve the matter in the best way we thought possible. Because you had all decided to have a meeting in one of the rooms, we did not want to disturb you, but once your meeting was finished we showed you to another room that we had prepared for you. 

Some of your claims I have to dispute – I have checked with the stewards and the kitchens – you were given a sandwich within ten minutes of placing your order, not 30 minutes, as you claim.
The kitchens provided dinner for all your guests, as requested, and I do not accept that some of your colleagues just had bread and butter – this is simply not true
The probable cause for this confusion is that you and your 6 colleagues all drank copious quantities of alcohol, resulting in all of you using extremely bad language to the staff – every other word was  a four letter word beginning with the letter “F”. The drinking even continued at breakfast on the Sunday morning.

On Sunday morning, you came to inform me that you had not received very good service from the staff. I calmly explained that Sri Lankans are primarily Buddhist and as such, swearing is not in their culture – they find it particularly offensive and especially the “F” word. They were all appalled at the language used by you and your colleagues, and therefore I had replied that it was hardly surprising if they had not served you as well as you claim you would have liked.

The fact is  for about three hours you were all in one suite, drinking and smoking cigaretttes -  smoking we explicitly forbid in the rooms – showing a flagrant disregard of the house rules. If that was not bad enough, you even chose to stub cigarettes out on the rug in the room. Do you consider this acceptable behaviour? 

I am not a racist, as you claimed -  we have had many Indian guests here, including recently a Bollywood film crew. I love India, and have visited the country many, many times.

Sadly, never have a group of guests behaved so appallingly as your party did.  After you left, I inspected all the rooms you occupied – and I was horrified. I have never seen such a mess as there was in each room.

When we entered we were simply blown away by the location and the greenery that surrounded the place. We were greeted by Garlands and taken to the coffee area. We were all smiles and were thanking the organizer of our trip for his wonderful selection.

This is where our ordeal started. I am diabetic and asked for a sandwich (Or anything else) as I was feeling a little low after the long drive. It took in excess of 30 minutes to get the sandwich and I was lucky. My friends (We were seven of us) who were lucky got their food after an hour the order of the unlucky ones was conveniently forgotten. We blamed it on a lack of understanding of English and forgot about it.

Subsequently we moved to our rooms which had a generally poor level of cleanliness (Stains/ Dust/ Unhygienic Toilets) and creepers and crawlies all over. We reasoned that the Creepers would have been a function of the fact that it is in a Jungle but the lack of basic hygiene was unexplainable.

We shut the windows to keep the mosquitoes out and switched on the air conditioning which didn’t work. We then requested the Management to give us another room which they managed only by 10 pm i.e. after 3 hours (This despite the fact that we were the only guests in the property). While we could understand the fact that the ACs sometimes can go bad, what we didn’t understand was why it took the hotel 3 hours to give us an alternate room. 

Service levels at dinner time added insult to injury. (A few of us had to make to with Bread and Butter).

While checking out the next day, I thought I'd speak with Mr. Cooper and share my experience. His reply was ""It's a Jungle what else do you expect"". I replied that after paying in excess of 300 dollars a night at the very least basic room service, hygienic rooms and functioning appliances. He replied ""So what do you want a discount?"" almost as if he was reprimanding me for bringing this to his notice. I replied in the affirmative to which his answer was that ""May be my staff didn't serve you well enough as they were appalled by the way you were talking to each other"" I said if we weren't rude to your staff what has the language we talk to each other in got to do with them not serving us. 

He then went on to add that you are Indians and ""Indian's are loud"" and Hindu's are very different from Buddhists and he finds it impossible to deal with them. 

I told Mr. Cooper ""If that's how you feel, please put a board out saying Indian's not allowed"", paid my balance and walked away in disgust.

,"11","123254434",,"en","447364",,"Owner","123431506","en","2012-01-22","GeorgeCooper_8","Unfortunately, it would appear that your stay at KK went wrong in your eyes the first evening you were here. 
You came to have dinner at 6pm and asked for rice and curry, as opposed to the a la carte menu offered. You were informed that rice and curry takes about three hours to prepare, that we offer it to all guests one night a week, and that should they want it on another evening, that we needed to know in advance. We pride ourselves in the food we offer and ALL of it is cooked to order – not simply re-heated like some places.

The response clearly did not appease you, and so the following day when you asked for olives with your sandwich, you saw fit to have a tantrum because the staff had brought you some olive oil. Nobody has, as far as I am aware, asked specifically for olives before, and the staff mistakenly thought you were asking for olive oil. It is a simple error, clearly something that was lost in translation, and not a deliberate ploy to upset you.

With regards to your breakfasts, there seems to have been some confusion over the order for a Sri Lankan breakfast and a Continental breakfast. I personally had received a message the night before to remind the kitchen staff that you both wanted Sri Lankan, so if your request was misinterpreted, then I do apologise. However this does happen in Sri Lanka – this is a third world country, after all, and while the staff speak some English, they are by no means fluent. 

I really do not know what to say about your breakfast complaints – we have not encountered these problems with other guests, and certainly not with the other guests who were staying here at the same time

If, as you claim, you had to wait for an hour to be offered some tea or coffee in the Living Pavilion, I can only apologise and assume that the staff you saw around you were the housekeeping, as they clean these public areas first before the bedroom suites. Had you simply asked one of them for tea or coffee, they would have organised this for you. All you had to do was ask!

Being Asian, I am sure you are aware of the concept of loss of face. Here, when asked a question, or asked to do something, more often than not, they will say yes, when the reality is that they may not have understood what has been asked of them, but do not want to admit to this. This is a cultural difference, and a hard nut to crack.
 
As a culture, Sri Lankans do not swear, and only very rarely do they resort to using foul language. You, Mabel, used the ""f"" word – amongst a number of other rude words - on a number of occasions, even to the extent asking the duty manager to translate it into Singhala. This was totally unacceptable, and inappropriate. You should show more sensitivity to a culture that is not yours, instead of displaying such vulgar and unattractive behaviour.

Your jibe in the review that the positive reviews must be my friends is a very cheap trick, and wholly unfounded.

We do not have tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms because there are staff to do this for you. Staying here is about relaxing and not having to do anything! 

Your claim about there being no room service is totally inaccurate - if guests want their meals in their room, in the garden, where ever, then we will be more than happy to oblige. 

I admit that we are currently having problems with wifi in the hotel, due a faulty antenna – electrical and mechanical items go wrong here on a regular basis, and it is not always easy to get hese matters sorted quickly. The replacement antenna is due shortly, and most guests are more forgiving of such problems.

All the staff here work very hard to meet the requests of our guests in order to enqure they enjoy their time here, and as you can see from the other reviews, this does, I am proud to say, seem to be the case with most of our guests. Clearly we were not the right hotel for you and your partner.

They market themselves to be a high end tailored service, to keep it short they are a 'fraud' absolutely disgusted by how the staff serves with an attitude, it took me one hour after 6 attempts in just ordering a poached egg for breakfast. For breakfast you would like a good start to the day, no, absolutely not here. I repeated several times to make sure my order was understood, at first they just ignored it, served my partner his food, and I was left waiting for them to even ask what I would like for breakfast, then I made my request finally after patiently waiting for them 15mins, repeated for their convenience just so they understood, and yet they still got it wrong. I ordered quite simply put it in plain and simple 2 poached eggs with the yolk runny, I got no eggs, then when I chased it up they gave me 2 squarish circle egg whites?! Ok I asked them again I wanted poached eggs with the egg yolk runny... They take the two egg whites back and reap
pear 10mins later with some dried egg yolk which they just fried back on to the previously egg whites. 50mins to get breakfast even after that i still didnt get any poached eggs, i was too exhausted from it i just left and went back to the room. This is to say the least of the service, the waiters where grumpy, I sat in the bar lounge area for 40mins yet no one even came to serve me and asked if I would like a drink, they just walked around me as if i wasnt there. 
The previous day I asked for olives in my sandwich, and they just turned up with a bowl of oil, which im assuming is olive oil? I gave up.
They market themselves to be a tailor made luxurious experience, all I can say is it has been Painfall. Utterly shocked. I am even surprised to see so many reviews for this hotel here that have rated it 'excellent' but it all made sense whilst my stay here... They are all friends of the owner George. 
Towels had stains on them, no tea/coffee making facilities, not even a kettle, no mini fridge in room, and also the funniest thing is not even room service! We were tired after a day out and wanted to chill out and have some room service, but guess what, there is no such thing in their eyes?! Shocked, especially in the modern day world especially a high end hotel? Last but not least, they state they have Internet wifi 'throughout the entire hotel' no, that's a lie. No Internet access in rooms, I am now typing this in the lounge bar area as I am forced to use the wifi here, not in the comfort of my own room. And yes I am currently typing this review whilst my stay here as I am absolutely shocked by the treatment here. I also don't want anyone else to be fooled by staying here in the future.
All I can say it, they are somewhat a 'fraud' and if you want a relaxing peaceful well looked after time in Sri Lanka, don't come here.

You are totally correct in stating that we do not allow children under the age of 12 years to stay in the hotel. However, like any other hotel, we do take bookings from non-residents for lunch and dinner. On the day that this particular group came to lunch, the hotel was not full and therefore we accepted their reservation. We are mindful of our guests and would not take such a booking if the hotel were full. At the time of booking we always say that if they have children, to keep them under control and to respect the guests who are staying in the hotel.
Clearly some people are completely insensitive to others. I do know that my staff did ask these lunch guests to control their children on three separate occasions, but this fell on deaf ears. When I returned to the hotel, lunch was nearly finished and the guests were about to leave. I did apologise to you both profusely, and gave you a complimentary dinner that evening, by way of some recompense. I am not sure what more we can do – we cannot “interview” guests prior to arrival!
You state that we are “the most  expensive hotel” – I grant you we are not cheap, but our prices are on a par with many similar hotels –  for example The Dutch House and the Kandy House, and we are in fact cheaper than The Fortress and the Amangalla. 
I have taken another look at our Breakfast Menu and I agree that the wording is perhaps misleading. As it happens, we have never charged a guest for “an extra” at breakfast. Thank you for pointing this out to me, and we have now changed the menu cards.
Again I do apologise for the time you had here, but this is a hotel not a private villa, and sadly some people do not have respect for others,  – not my fault, I think you will agree.

The hotel is beautiful in a wonderful location and the room was fantastic. We were lying by the pool relaxing just enjoying the tranquility on my wife’s birthday, when 14 people (including 6 young children) arrived for lunch and proceeded to completely ruin our afternoon. The children were allowed to run riot as the parents sat in the restaurant and completely ignored them. We understood that the hotel had a policy of not allowing young children; also we were not made aware that they allowed visitors from other hotels to come for lunch.
 
We had specifically organized our trip around Sri Lanka in such a way that we could spend my wife’s birthday in peace and quiet at the idyllic location of Kahanda Kanda. We accepted that it is a very expensive hotel but were prepared to pay the price in order to have the exclusivity. Unfortunately my wife’s birthday was ruined completely due to the noise and disruption, we both had headaches from all the screaming & shouting and we felt like refugees. It was a complete waste of money!!

Another small point about the hotel was that we paid for bed & breakfast, but their idea of breakfast was you could have fruit salad & curd or eggs, if you wanted fruit followed by eggs then we had to pay extra. This was the only hotel out of the 11 that we stayed at where this was the case.","Beautiful hotel & location but George needs to review the idea of outside visitors!","2011-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r103856858-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

To be fair much of the food at the sri lankan boutique hotels we tried (the sun house, kahanda kanda, the forte hotel, the fort printers hotel, Cinnamon Lakeside) was a bit poor and at sometimes amateurish but kk took the biscuit! or not as the case may be. we were served some kind of chicken dish. a fillet covered in some kind of egg crust. it was not bread crumb or anything recognisable as coming from a competent kitchen. on other reviews i have read the owner defending his kitchen, which he may feel he has to do, but really, this chicken thing we were given was embarrassing. we did not know what to say. and no one bothered to ask. was it some kind of attempt at a 'chicken' schnitzel, without the schnitzel part, an omelette gone wrong via a piece of chicken falling in the pan? we ended up enjoying our meal by playing a kind of virtual ready-steady-cook, thinking up a number of ways, with the same ingredients, how the food could have turned out. What we were given was poor kids food at best, it was so lacking in flavour. i had better plane food, even a ryan air sandwich would have been more interesting. considering the mark up on food at such a exclusive place and the abundance of interesting, flavoursome, and incredibly cheap (especially to a kitchen charging ten times the price of a locally canteen) local produce they really should have anything to do with serving food. its inexcusable.","inexcusable. embarrassing food shame about the location","2011-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r94682922-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

As the owner/manager, I find it rather amazing that you should say the hotel is very expensive, when you were given a hugely reduced room rate, by claiming that your sister who is the current Australian High Commissioner, was the guest, when in fact it was you and your partner. Like many hotels here in Sri Lanka, we have a ""local"" rate - approximately 40% off our normal room rate - which is for Sri Lankans, expats living here (with valid resident visas), and members of the dilpomatic corps. Neither you nor your partner qualified for this, but you had managed to get this price through your sister's position at the High Commission, and so we honoured it. 

You then changed your arrival date, which we accommodated, and then when you were here, you decided to leave one day early, and were most reluctant to abide by our Terms and Conditions regarding cancellations. We did not charge you for the last night, despite the fact we then had an empty room, and at Peak Season.
 
In addition, you not only brought all your own alcohol to consume in your room, but also your own food, which we kept in the bar fridge for you! 
Somewhat unusual behaviour.

One of our selling points is that the suites are decorated with a mix of antique and modern pieces, and have a very personalised feel. I take exception to your claim about the rooms being ""cluttered with junk ""antiques"""". I appreciate that everybody has their own taste, but I guess Kahanda Kanda was not to your liking.

We have never before had a guest complain about the amount of delicious home made muesli served at breakfast - I shall, of course review this, but the bowls used at breakfast are of a generous size.

We do not provide accommmodation for drivers, which is the case with most boutique hotels, but are more than happy to arrange accommodation for them at a local guest house just 3km away - not too much of a hardship.

I wish you luck at the next place you stay.

The owner indicated Expedia did not send the room type which was a lie because I emailed the property directly forwarding the reservation. We decided to try and make the most of it and freshened up and departed to see Kandy. Upon return we retreated to our room and went to use the bathroom and the stench was unbearable. We had not used it except to shower! This was a different smell as if something died in the wall. We were up all night waiting for management in the morning. Due to the lack of English skills we were first told she was arriving later only to be told later she was not coming. We were finally moved at 9am (to Raspberry Dream a nicer room) in time for us to depart for our day. They offered us a cake as a thank you. After the disgusting breakfast eggs I wanted to eat nothing from them. We ate all our dinner meals at The Kandy House - expensive but worth it to ensure optima hygiene.

This, unfortunately, was by far the worst hotel we have stayed in. And not just in Sri Lanka! 

I will start with the positives: 

1. the staff in the bar are friendly, provide good service and make great cocktails. 

2. the food was of a good standard.

3. Housekeeping is good although rooms are dated. 

Where they seriously let themselves down is the service in the restaurant. Tables are left a mess so any new guests coming in for dinner are unable to find a clean set table. When you do ask someone to clean it, it is not done properly. You have to find someone to order drinks. And then you have to wait a long time to receive your drink. Dirty plates are not cleared. 

The restaurant is too small for the number of guests and it’s very poorly managed. None of the food is labelled for allergens, no one asks if there are any food allergies. Sadly it was a disappointing end to the excellent hotels and service we have received in all the other hotels we stayed in along the way.

We did spend one night at Cinnamon Lodge and that was a very different, enjoyable experience.","Sad end to a great holiday","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r999244356-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We travelled nearly 4 hours to Colombo after booking an extra night via LastMinute.com only to arrive at the hotel to be informed that the hotel was full and the online booking had not been confirmed.  After checking a room was found, which believe it or not was more expensive than booking online with LastMinute.com.  We had already booked for two further nights before arriving in Sri Lanka so those bookings were confirmed.  
We were advised by the check in staff that the reservation had not been confirmed on the hotels system so we contacted LastMinute.com and arranged a refund which we knew would take some time.  When the refund arrived it was short as the hotel had taken their commission (even though they say it was not booked by the online company) which is why we paid direct to book the room with the hotel.

I have contacted the hotel via several methods but not one person has had the decency to reply after nearly a month of email chasers.  I work in the industry and recommend Sri Lanka to many of my guests and upon dealing with my DMC I now always ask them to quote me without any Cinnamon hotels or their partners.

Late night pool parties and bar music playing loud to disturb the comfort of the residing guests. You pay a premium to the property to experience comfort but here it’s the opposite. This hotel is not for family or kids. Rude inconsiderate staff. Their priority is to facilitate the loud late night sound. 
Would highly recommend not to opt for this property if travelling with family and elderly.
The rooms facing the pool and bar aren’t sound proofed and hence your night time is pretty much filled with irritating noise and sleepless night. You would repent of the money you pay to the hotel. 

We too opt for the hotel looking the reviews but reality was much different. No action of the hotel management to rectify the disturbances.

Cinnamon Lakeside is one of those hotels that was probably quite nice in the mid 1980s. But she's been forgotten since then. Neglected.

Noisy at night with the club band blasting cover songs from the pool area (nearing midnight as I write this, and too noisy to sleep). Think karaoke on steroids. Now you got it.

We were rather surprised to read your recent one-star review for a stay that happened in December last year.   
We wish to clear certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations contained therein. 
Your family booked the Residence Suite for your parents, a beach room for another member of your family and the entry level Fortress room category for you. 
A reader of your review may get the impression that you are describing the Suite as disappointing. You will understand that the features and facilities of different categories of rooms are in sync with the charges thereof. The Fortress room does not have sea view that is made clear at the point of booking. 
Your entire family stayed for four days without any complaint and one day before the scheduled check out date, all of you wanted to check out for a seemingly personal matter unrelated to the hotel. Your request for a full refund of the unutilized day for all three rooms was regretfully declined as it was the peak December period. Hotels do not refund in case of an early check out without good reason. However, considering your repeated request and the peak season tariff, we refunded all expenses incurred as extras by all three rooms (a considerable amount of money) as a conciliatory gesture. 
It is a matter of regret that you chose to publish inaccurate and uncomplimentary opinions about our hotel, without acknowledging the considerable concessions made, because you did not receive the full refund requested.

The Fortress Hotel not only failed to meet its advertised standards but also created false expectations, leading to a regrettable experience for us.

The rooms were plagued with issues, especially dampness and an air-conditioning system that was stuck at 19C and on full blast (despite several attempts to fix it), which created an uncomfortable and unpleasant environment. We also discovered a hazardous electrical socket, posing a serious safety risk. Such neglect of basic safety standards was unacceptable and added to our dissatisfaction with the hotel.

The Presidential Suite we booked consisted of two rooms and a sitting room, but none of them met the five-star quality we expected. The sitting room was excessively dark, with furniture facing inward instead of towards the sea, and the carpet had stains. The blinds, curtains, and air-conditioning were outdated and dysfunctional. Even the balcony offered a disappointing view of broken sun loungers piled up below, along with mould all along the edge of the plunge pool.

To make matters worse, despite expecting a sea view in both rooms, one of them faced a brick wall, making it extremely dark. When we raised this issue, the hotel failed to provide any remedy or compensation.

Given the multitude of issues we encountered, we had no choice but to cut short our stay. It was highly disappointing to have to leave early, especially considering the promised luxury we were led to believe in. The fortress Hotel failed to deliver on its commitments, leaving us with a bitter and regrettable experience.

In conclusion, the Fortress Hotel fell short in every aspect of our stay, from misleading advertising to filthy conditions, damp rooms, faulty air-conditioning and a hazardous electrical socket. It is regrettable that such a highly promoted establishment failed to live up to its promises and left us deeply disappointed.","Not a Five Star Hotel","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r940883439-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

At the outset we wish to express our regret for the turn of events. 
When we review the sequence of events that led to your displeasure, we found it was initially the communication error from your office about the date of arrival to the Suite. Since the suite was occupied on the date you require, we had to reschedule the visit. 
Thereafter we observe regretfully that you found almost everything in a negative light. We had several guests who stayed with us during the same period, who have rated the same services and buffets highly. We wish to record this incongruence of views of guests who stayed at the same time for the benefit of readers of this review. This is to assist them to make a better-informed decision about the hotel. 
In keeping with World Tourism objectives, we have handed nearby tours and trips to locals who operate small tuk tuk type vehicles opposite the hotel. Due to the recent depreciation of the local rupee and high inflation coupled with rising cost of fuel the established prices to Galle and places have increased in rupee terms. They are still quite reasonable in dollar/euro terms. This pricing decision you will appreciate is not under our direct control.   
Whilst thanking you for the visit, we regret very much your complete dissatisfaction with the stay. Had you raised these issues during your stay we could have addressed the issues or explain ourselves to you.

When i offered to move it till next week he said its no problem, so why fight with me on the phone for no reason for 20 minutes, if you could just offer to move the booking. Finally when we arrived we saw a very beautiful place but then things started to happen, we received a personal butler who barely understood what i was saying and i needed to repeat myself usually 2-3 times, no chance for a normal conversation. The floor in the room (which was good) was wet all the time if the AC was off, and when the AC was on the floor was dry but it was freezing. The food is just simply disgusting, on a Full Board , we had buffet 2 times. The stuff doesn't know how to cut meat , i was just standing for more than 5 minutes looking at a poor guy trying to cut huge fish with a unsharpened knife, eventually his mentor hit him on the hands and did it for him, but it was already ruined, it was shredded. people were taking plates from our table even though we did not finish eating. When i asked 2 beers for myself i heard oh my good from my so called butler, which is kinda annoying considering that im paying close to 400 usd per night. They also have scammers across the road that will charge you 5x of the normal price for transportation. The hotel cant help with transfers for normal price. offered us a trip for 7k to Gall, after which i ordered a taxi for 1.5. On top of that they don't know how to operate with bank cards from EU countries , good thing it was only 8 eur, but i needed to pay twice, even though i clearly showed in my online banking that the amount was deducted, i think it was too complicated for the management to understand online banking and the concept of the *money was deducted* . On top of that me and my wife were vomiting all night after we left.  As a result, spent more than 200k on this trip for 1 night, very bad experience, incompetent staff, food terrible, food poisoning.

Ayubowan from The Fortress Resort and Spa!!

Whilst thanking the reviewer for taking the time in sharing the  feedback on Trip Advisor, we are glad to note the positive points mentioned in the reviewers comments. As to the reviewers main concern regarding the payment to be done is USD vs Rupees. Let me explain the reason for our actions – the GOSL issued a Regulation on 21st January 2022 under subject ‘Acceptance of foreign exchange within Sri Lanka by all registered Hotel service providers, licensed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, were required to accept payments in respect of the services rendered to persons residing outside Sri Lanka in foreign exchange with effect from the date of these rules’.As an internationally reputed company, registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism and Development Authority we are compelled by law to follow the issued guidelines. Understandably, there may be some establishments that choose not to follow these guidelines, which is beyond our control.
 
With reference to the reviewer’s statement relating to the maintenance of the hotel - let us explain, being located directly in front of the Indian ocean, up-keeping the property is a huge task. The hotel is specially exposed to sea spray with a high salt content. The hotel, therefore constantly keeps painting the entire property on a regular preventive maintenance routine programme in maintaining the hotel standards.As the reviewer has mentioned quite correctly noticing the General Manager having regular meetings, which is a part of the preventive maintenance programme of the entire property.

We have addressed the complaint made in relation to the food and beverage services and the issue with the pigeons to the relevant heads of departments for their necessary action, We are however concerned, that the reviewer, had not brought up the shortfalls experienced during their stay.
 
Our apologies for the shortcomings experienced during the reviewers stay, and we look forward to the reviewers next visit. 

Stay Safe!!

Let's start with the positives: Amazing surrounding, great potential of the place, beach almost deserted, pool huge, view amazing, rooms big. We got a free upgrade and some additional benefits when we booked through their website vs. booking or any other 3party site. The Spa was nice and the treatments good. A bit a the top end of pricing, but good. 

Whilst all staff was very friendly the service lacked training and the maintenance of the place was simply poor. Acknowledging two years of Covid that might have affected the status quo. The staff was often overwhelmed with requests, were not aware of the guests booking status, e.g. breakfast/HB...  (even after several nights), meals ordered a la carte took forever to arrive (partially 45-60mins) and billing was often incorrect. The staff was always friendly and tried to do their best, but for a 5 star hotel you expect a little more than just friendly. Maintenance of the property was equally poor: Paint was coming of the walls, pieces of the pool were coming of (dangerous for adults and kids), the wooden planks were deformed due to heat/humidity, sunbeds were not properly clean, problem with pigeons added another layer of uncleanliness. The air-condition in the room was super noisy and no way to be fixed. Excursions were offered but quite pricey. When checking out we were told we had to pay everything in USD vs. in Sri Lanka Rupie, which made us suspicious and seemed to have been wrong as we stayed in another property after and we paid everything in local currency. Moreover, and this is the worst and the actual reason for writing this review: my husband got sick to the extend that he went to hospital after arriving back home in need of treatment as he got a bacterial infection from food. Arguably we cannot say that this happened definitely at the Fortress, but we took 80% of our meals there. 
All in all, this property and its placement is unique and has lots of potential. At the time of our visit we were disappointed by all the factors already described. Whilst we were there we noticed some meetings happening with the general manager, maybe they were discussing maintenance, reparation work. I do hope so, because the place is a jewel. For us, luckily we got a free upgrade & some additional benefits booking through their website otherwise our vacation would have taken a very different turn.

We hope that we can convince you to change your mind about another visit to our hotel. One of our members will keep in touch with you directly if you would be willing to give us a chance to turn your experience around.

The best asset the hotel has is it's general staff, who are friendly, efficient and gave a good level of service.The pool and sun loungers are good, and the grounds are well maintained.

Our room was well appointed, but very dark. The dehumidifier cannot cope with the humidity from the plunge pool, which makes the room very damp. All our clothes smelled musty when we got home, so we had to wash things we hadn't even worn.

But what really let the hotel down was the kitchen. My wife and I have travelled extensively over the past 25 years across the world, including remote parts of Africa and Asia, and therefore stayed in many hotels. We have visited Sri Lanka twice before, once touring, and last Christmas at another 5* hotel. We have never suffered with food poisoning on any of our trips. Following the Christmas Eve buffet at this hotel, my wife spent Christmas day with chronic diarhoea, listlessness and loss of appetite. Two days later, I had the same. We decided to avoid the buffet, but on the 13th night of our stay my wife got food poisoning again, this time with added extreme vomiting. We also heard of other guests having stomach problems. Not wanting to be ill on our journey home and feeling we could not trust the food any more, we spoke to our excellent local rep Kristi and arranged to leave a day early.

Another concern was the kitchen's lack of confidence about what foods contain gluten. My wife is allergic to gluten and the chefs seemed very confused at times. They seem to believe that gluten is in Hollandaise sauce, as at one breakfast she asked for Eggs Benedict and got poached eggs on gluten-free bread. One evening she was served curry with poppadoms that were removed at the last second. The Head Chef one day asked me whether chickpea flour was ok, and another day insisted that green peas contain gluten. We have never encountered these issues at other hotels and it is a real concern for people with allergies.

I somehow doubt that the hotel will accept this criticism, and will say they asked us if we wanted to see a doctor. When you are staying in a supposed luxury hotel, you should not get ill in the first place. It's a shame because it's the one reason I can guarantee we will never return to this hotel.","Major food concerns","2018-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r642771287-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We are surprised with comments made by the reviewer. The reviewer’s major issue was the lack of privacy which was informed to us by the agent. The agent upon receiving the complaint the following night informed the hotel if we could offer a room upgrade. The only available room to offer was the Fortress Residence suite which is the highest category available due to the high occupancy. The suite was offered at a very significant discounted rate mainly considering the privacy issue raised by the reviewer. This was conveyed to the agent who informed the hotel that they would speak to the client, but was declined by the reviewer. The Resident Manager then spoke to the clients the following evening. The Resident Manager was informed by the reviewer that their main concern is that the hotel is not what they expected. They expected the Fortress to be a small hotel which has privacy and less families same as the previous hotels they have stayed prior to coming to the Fortress. The Resident Manager informed the reviewer that the agent is also in touch with us and that we are prepared to offer any assistance to ensure they have a comfortable stay at the Fortress. But unfortunately the reviewer informed the Resident Manager that there is nothing that could be done as it is not the hotel what they expected.

The Following morning the reviewer was informed of a free upgrade to a junior suite which was falling vacant for the entire stay, but the reviewer informed that they are heading out to visit a few other properties in the area and would get back to us. The next day morning the reviewer requested to speak to the Resident Manager, who met the reviewer at breakfast and was informed that they are moving to another hotel. The Resident Manager informed the reviewer that arrangements have been made to move them to a Junior suite which will be available and it would be offered to them FOC, which was the second category suite and not a larger suite as mentioned by the reviewer. But the reviewer declined the offer and opted to leave.

The reviewer also claims that her Husband was sick after one breakfast which was only informed to the Resident Manager during their initial discussion. The Resident Manager offered to get medical assistance, but was declined by the reviewer. The upgrade to the Junior suite was offered to the reviewer as a gesture of goodwill by the hotel as they are seeking for privacy for their stay and not due to a fault of the resort, even though the resort was willing to bear the financial loss.

The resort declines the rest of the comments made by the reviewer regarding hygiene standards, Staff, Food and rooms.

It is very evident that the reviewer was expecting a financial refund from the hotel.
Once again we thank the reviewer for their review on The Fortress Resort and Spa and look forward to seeing 
them in the near future.

The first part we had stayed in wonderful hotels and locations and received outstanding hospitality and seen large parts of the country.

The Fortress was to be a place to truly relax and unwind and it did not fulfil this. The room we were allocated was damp (in fact wet at times!) and was dirty. Our nights there were spent with wet sheets and our clothes were damp. Visible damp patches on the wall, and around the skirting board.

The food is of a poor standard, unappealing and I would question the hygiene. My husband became ill after one breakfast.

The spa was also of a low quality and we would again question its hygiene.

This does not feel like a five star or boutique hotel, with buffet meals,repeat ‘theme’ nights and happy hour widely advertised on chalk boards.

The staff serving are friendly and keen to be of assistance on the whole, and also very smiley and cheerful. I would concur with previous reviews that the waiting  staff are too eager to remove plates as soon as you put down your cutlery on the restaurant.

We reported all of our concerns to the manager. We were initially offered to upgrade rooms at the cost of USD 550 a night! We declined and sourced a different hotel with the help of our agent. Once we had made arrangements to transfer to a different hotel for our final four nights, we were then offered a larger suite (FOC). We declined this as we felt that much of what we did not like about the hotel would not be corrected by this.

So not only did we pay for our eight night stay at The Fortress and pay in full (the management were not prepared to make any gesture of good will financially), we then had to pay the full
cost of the new hotel, which by the way was outstanding. Having spoken to the manager on one occasion he told us he would come back to us after speaking to our agents. He did so by sending one of his more junior staff to communicate with us (once he knew we had made arrangements to leave). This was very disappointing and I would have thought a basic element of hospitality management is to communicate effectively with the clients. 

Before we left The Fortress I requested to speak to the manager again who then came to speak to us. Previously that morning he had seen us and not acknowledged us. I gave him my final feedback and he said he would speak to his head office. Since then I have heard nothing.

Overall a very disappointing stay at a hotel which looks and feels tired, with damp rooms.","Certainly not five star and not boutique either in any way","2018-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r639671883-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

As for the Transport, the hotel works with the local village community in providing them a helping hand to uplift their living standards.

We appreciate the constructive appreciation made regarding the architectural aspect of the hotel, the Staff, Pool area etc. We are however, very surprised with the negative comment with regard to the Sri Lankan dishes and fine dining menu , especially when the majority of our guests have praised our Sri Lankan dishes which are rated very good and excellent.
 
 
The preparation of the signature Sri Lankan curry dishes are prepared taken into consideration that most European clients palates do not agree to very spicy dishes. Due to this reason all dishes are prepared at a very mild level. In the event a client requests the curries to be less spicy, it is done by adding coconut milk to reduce the spiciness. Naturally the color and taste would change. The secret behind the taste and color of the Sri Lankan dishes are the spices which are added.
 
The mise en place for all dishes are done well in advance as done in any hotel around the world. The resort does not serve left over dishes and do not agree with the clients comment ‘what we presume was, last night’s left over curry’.
 
Being located adjacent to the sea it takes a considerable effort and time to up keep the building in perfect shape in the Monsoon period with the humidity factor and apologize for the inconvenience caused to the clients by the damp conditions.
 
Beach cleaning is done on a daily basis by the hotel and have already taken the initiative and placed waste bins , cloth hanger's and a bicycle stand for the local community using the beach to help in keeping the beach clean.
 
We look forward to your return visit to the Fortress in the near future.

Thank you.

We saw a few negative reviews remarking the same, but also many stating they were impressed with the food - we listen to the wrong reviews and stayed here. I really cannot stress enough how disappointed we were with the dinners. We stayed in Sri Lanka for 2 weeks, The Fortress for 3 nights, and the dinners were to the worst standard for the whole trip, and a lot more expensive.
For the first night we ordered the signature Sri Lankan curry dishes - one chicken and one fish. We asked for this not too spicy (after being given the choice by the waiter). The curry was far too spicy, and arrived 30 seconds after we had finished our starter - this only possible by the fact the curry had been made earlier in the evening, and left ready to serve diners. We asked the waiter for something less spicy as we could not eat the food - he was more than willing to oblige, took our curries away, and returned with new plates. The meat had been removed from the spicier sauce, and put into some sort of coconut milk sauce, which lacked any flavour, colour, or complexity you would expect from a 5* hotel. We had to send this back as well - it was simply not something you could eat and enjoy. By this point, all rather bemused at the cooking, we opted for some cold starters.. The waiter did remove the disappointing curries from the bill, but by this point, we knew what we had let ourselves in for! 
We tried the fine dining menu one evening, which again was disappointing. While it seemed the chefs had taken longer to prepare the food, it was simply not worth the money, or impressive at all. 
In other food news - the selection at breakfast was good. Hit up the made to order egg station for something fresh. Or you can try, what we presume was, last nights left over curry! 
Pool food was limited, but much better than the dinner. The pizza was the best on the menu! You can use the hotel app for a discount, however we found sometimes this did not work and we were left waiting 45 minutes for our drinks - again the staff apologised and offered us a free drink at dinner to compensate. 
As for the rest of the hotel - the building has some natural history, and is laid out well. The pool area overlooking the ocean, and some wild swimming turtles, again was lovely. We did feel however the hotel could be doing more to keep the adjacent beach clean. 
Our room was huge, but smelt musty, and the corridor to the room was often wet (not sure why) - one day after the hallways had been painted we were met with water / paint on the floor. Again not something you would expect from a 5* hotel. 
The staff were probably the redeeming factor here - they were helpful and polite. But it's hard to ignore the shortcomings of the hotel, especially at this price. For what else is on offer in Sri Lanka, we were disappointed to have chosen this hotel. 
I would not recommend this hotel, and unfortunately would not return.","Worst food we ate in Sri Lanka :(","2018-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r580399852-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Checked into a beachfront splash room, immediately the smell of Mould and humidity in the room. Noticing the lack of working ventilation around our in room pool so the room is highly humid. The room needs some urgent TLC for a premium 5* Hotel, mouldy patches in the bathroom and directly next to the bed sleeping area ( see photos). Looking up at the ceiling it’s just a horrible mess with visibly painted damp patches. 

The wooden amenity boxes in the bathroom have not been changed for years and don’t look luxury at all and are all chipped. 

Toilet area smells of raw sewage, they try to mask this by putting burning oils in the bathroom but when the candles run dry, the smell returns and is awful. 

Outside is no better, the garden grass is littered with small plastic pieces and cigarette butts, can’t they clean this up?

Breakfast was fine with a standard collection of local and western dishes, but nothing exceptional and they lack labels on a number of items so you have to keep asking what it is. The service in the Hotel was decent throughout and was often asked by staff if we needed anything. 

Did not eat at their breath front seafood restaurant as it just looks a sorry sight, placed some meters away from the shore line next to a concrete wall, they really should re-imagine this space to invite customers and profit that the hotel is on a most beautiful shoreline. 

Pool area is very nice and has separate pools for children. The cleaning and maintenance team of this hotel really need to do some work.

Service was ok and not great. Same service at the breakfast buffet where we had to wait for over 20 minutes to get coffee. You would think that they would have at least have coffee ready when opening the buffet. The food was average and nothing special given the cost of the stay.

The room had very few bright lights. The lights were so dim that it was difficult to even pack the luggage properly. They never thought about normal bright lights with dimmers?

The TV was confusing to use. They showed it as modern but we just wanted to watch the news and a few international channels and it was messy.

We asked to have our luggage taken to the car and waited for some time and had to go find someone to actually do it.

Wifi was quite patchy and very slow when it did work.

No walkable beach in front of the hotel. Hard to get to the beach on the side of the hotel. You have to jump down about 4 feet to get to sand.

His reply to me was to pay for the food and get out as Im not the staying guest at the hotel. Well I am a paying guest as I just had a lunch and paid in full for the terrible service. As if his abusive behaviour wasn't enough. Another male member of staff joined in the abuse while their main Manager stood by and watched his male staff be verbally abusive to a female customer. This type of negative behaviour reflects in the atmosphere of the place. The regular staff must be badly treated as they look unhappy and are slow to  serve you at the table. The food is not great either for such establishment and service very disorganised. Not to mention that shouting at your customers at any point even shouting at another human being a total stranger is not a normal way to behave in life but especially in this type of establishment.

The 2 star rating is mainly because of the food and partly because of its rooms. For a hotel that charges 300 dollars or more for a night, I expected a lot more. Their food is nowhere on par with hotels in this price range, Food is actually appalling. Breakfast is very basic, lunch was just off the room service menu and dinner was nothing memorable either. Me and my wife were given menus that were slightly different from each other which the waiter wasn't even aware of.

We are truly heartbroken and deeply sorry that your experience at Jetwing Lake was one of distress and violation. What you endured is unacceptable, and no guest should ever have to face such a situation especially not within the space that should offer complete privacy and comfort.

While no apology can undo the pain caused, we want to assure you and all future guests that this incident was treated with the utmost seriousness at the highest levels of our organisation.

The team member involved was immediately terminated, and the full cost of your stay was refunded. Our Managing Director personally reached out to express our deepest apologies, and a formal review of our protocols was launched across all Jetwing properties.

As a family-run company with over 50 years of service, our people have always been our greatest strength — but in this case, we failed to uphold the values we stand for. Your courage in sharing this, despite your pain, will help us do better. It is our responsibility to ensure that no other guest ever feels unsafe or disrespected under our care.

I hesitated to share this out of embarrassment, but I believe it’s important for future guests to be aware, especially solo female travelers or groups of women.

During my stay, while I was in the shower, a male housekeeping staff member entered my room. Despite the unmistakable sound of running water, he proceeded to go deeper into the room and look through the clear glass door, seeing me in a state of complete vulnerability. It was extremely evident that someone was in the shower, but he wanted to look anyway. The sense of violation and trauma I felt in that moment is hard to put into words. I wanted to leave immediately, but it was our last night there so I just told myself to get through this one night.

The hotel’s initial response was wholly inadequate. They offered to comp our dinner and “upgrade” me to a similar room with a larger balcony and better view, as if that could somehow rectify what had happened. It wasn’t until after my tour agent intervened did the hotel refund the full cost of my stay.

The follow-up correspondence from the hotel’s General Manager included the usual assurances: that this was an isolated incident, and that staff training would be improved. While I truly hope they follow through on these promises, I feel that basic staff protocols, such as not entering a room when someone is in the shower, should not require additional training. They are common sense. Please, do better.","Deeply Troubling Incident!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r1011737435-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

This is the third time I have visited and noticed that the standards have fallen significantly. Here is a list of my observations. I will most likely not visit again.

Room
======
1. The room did not have enough towels for three guests. Once requested they were made available subsequently.
2. The air conditioning / the ventilation system was defective. The temperature could not be lowered below 26 degrees. Once communicated, the technicians came twice and said that it is beyond their ability to fix.

Restaurant / Meals
==================
1. The restaurant was filled with flies at the time of lunch (17th) and many got in the food. No attempt was made to remedy it.
2. Dessert spoons were missing and had to be requested at each meal.
3. The stewardess communicated that dinner will be served at 7pm (17th). However a waiter staff meeting was held in the restaurant until 730pm. All the guests were asked to stand in the garden area until that meeting was over.
4. Some guests were given reserved tables. Other guests were asked to move elsewhere to accommodate them (18th).","The standards have fallen","2022-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r872809789-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay with us at Jetwing Lake, Dambulla. 

It was pleasing to read that you enjoyed the room we allocated for your stay, and indeed, we are quite blessed by the positive reviews we have received from our guests who have stayed with us.

We have taken note of your observation with regard to the view of the lake, and it is correct that some of the rooms have the view obstructed by the beautiful semi-jungle landscaping, giving a different type of experience. On your next visit, we would be more than happy to allocate you a room with a direct lake view.

You are correct that the main restaurant is entirely open-air, something that has been appreciated by many. Alternatively, we do have a fully air-conditioned, very large bar with a wide selection of snacks and a lunch/dinner menu, as well as a fully air-conditioned Chinese restaurant.

Your constructive feedback on the item selection on the set menu is taken very positively, and I will personally share your points with the kitchen crew and the Executive Chef to see what can be modified in the future. Thank you again for bringing this issue to our attention. 

I hope your experience will not deter you from giving us another opportunity to demonstrate the real Jetwing Lake standard, and we hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Jetwing Lake in the future.

Please feel free to contact me directly if I can be of any assistance.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

(3) Their half board food options are super short sighted - most of the items on the menu either have alcohol or pork or seafood - which is not convenient for travelers from the middle east or someone who is pregnant.

We are all naturally disappointed to learn that your experience at our Spa was not what you had expected and that you departed the hotel unhappy. I am sorry that we let you down in our spa service and we could not recover due to not being aware of the dissatisfaction during your stay.

However, I would like to apologize to you on behalf of the spa team and rest assured that similar kind of mistakes will not occur in the future and will make sure all our future guests are looked after very well with more care and passion. 

However, we were glad to hear that you found our rooms, general service and the associates to be great and in general they all were up to your expectations. Therefore we sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity to serve you with world renowned Jetwing hospitality.

WORST 45 MINUTES OF MY LIFE. The female masseur just poured oil all over my body and focus on anywhere except my head and shoulders. When I told her to increase the pressure, she just poured more oil. Seems like she's just moving her hands up and down instead. The second time I asked if this is head and shoulders or is it a full body massage. Her colleague said yes it's head and shoulder. The masseur then spent the remaining 30 mins massaging my head and pouring shitloads of oil ON MY HEAD AND FOREHEAD. Totally unenjoyable.. her English is not good or maybe she understands but just doesn't want to put in more energy in doing her work. The next day, I have a major acne breakout on my forehead and back thanks to her oil spam. DO NOT, AT ANY COST GO FOR MASSAGE AT THIS HOTEL! The room and general service of the staff is great but the massage is really really bad. 3,500 rupees for 45 mins.. not exactly cheap. I expected much better than an oil bath.

Then you have the constant noise coming from the factory behind where everything coming from the hotel is recycled, which is very nice, but the noise is getting on your nerves pretty quickly.
The food is also really below standards, poor choices and low quality.
The check in process is super slow and no one seems to be speaking a decent English.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We truly regret that your experience at our property did not meet your expectations.

While we are pleased to hear you appreciated the charm of the building, we’re genuinely sorry to learn that other aspects of your stay were disappointing. We sincerely apologize if our team’s attentiveness felt intrusive — our intention is always to provide warm and considerate service, and we will take your comments into account to better balance attentiveness with guest comfort.

We’re also sorry to hear about the challenges you faced with the access road, however the bungalow is in the middle of a tea estate and the roads are generally of that state. To overcome this we provided you with a shuttle and we apologise if that did not suit your expectations. 

Your observations are valuable, and we are already working on several improvements to enhance the overall guest experience, including transport arrangements and room environment management.

We appreciate your honest feedback, as it helps us to improve. We hope you’ll consider giving us another opportunity in the future to provide you with a more enjoyable stay.

This is to express my disappointment regarding the service I received during a recent visit to Sheraton Colombo. My friends and I had chosen the Saturday dinner buffet, expecting a pleasant dining experience. Unfortunately, our evening was far from enjoyable.
From beginning, we encountered issues. The staff seemed indifferent, manipulating reservation details and deliberately directing us to separate corners despite ample available seating nearby. Sheraton’s policy of segregating groups of friends struck us as unnecessary and unwelcoming. 
Furthermore, they attributed this policy to instructions from NTB Bank, although their initial lack of awareness about our payment method (card offer or cash) was confusing.

The floor manager’s conduct throughout the evening was particularly disappointing. His dismissive attitude and lack of respect toward customers, including our group and others facing similar seating issues, left us feeling very much UNCOMFORTABLE!. A dinner among close friends should be a convenient and enjoyable experience, but Sheraton Colombo FAILED to meet these expectations due to its POOR SERVICE STANDARDS. When we raised our concerns, the manager attempted to shift blame entirely to NTB Bank. However, his excuses fell flat, failing to address the inconvenience we endured. 
To our surprise, Irrfan Dain - another staff member, approached us WITH AGGRESSION, insisting we discuss the matter elsewhere. HIS AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR escalated, and he even ATTEMPTED to PHYSICALLY INVOLVE with one of my friends.

Such behavior toward a paying customer is unacceptable and borders on ASSAULT. We urge Marriot Group to take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure a more respectful and CUSTOMER-centric approach / SAFETY in the future.","Unprecedented DISAPPOINTMENT: SHERATON COLOLMBO’s FAILURE to Prioritize Customer Convenience!!!","2024-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12079973-r938865750-Sheraton_Colombo_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The front desk staff /cs agent at the Colombo Kitchen was full of attitude and deliberately placed the guests who came in as known to each other but with separate bookings in opposite corners at the dining room and gave the stupidest excuses when asked why we cannot sit closer to each other but in separate tables atleast. We never asked them to place us in the same table and separate bills as we were aware of the terms & conditions of the offer. We simply requested to place us at the tables closer to each other so that we could at least see each other! There were no table allocations or table numbers what so ever as we saw them doing this to other guests as well and there were many people complaining and arguing on the same issue yet giving attitude towards the guests as if we have come there to have free food! First they said there were no reservation under my name though I made the reservation more than a week before and even got a call today afternoon from the hotel for confirmation which I confirmed but they didn’t have my name in the list when we came in and then had to go through inconvenience after inconvenience. Most of the staff didn’t even had the courtesy to even smile and no proper service to the guests. Though there was a good selection of food, the taste was awful. Your customer service needs to improve a lot for a 5 star hotel and the worst service comparing to other 3 hotels of the Marriott group in SL. When we raised this as a complaint while leaving, one of the managers were actually communicating with us properly while some other manager by the name of Irfhan Dean sort of argued and asked to come and speak to him separately and was arrogant towards one of our friends.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you for your review in TripAdvisor, which we truly appreciate as a feedback. Unfortunately though we have reviewed your complaint and understood that the concern is a misunderstanding of the concepts available for safaris within Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Our safaris are two folds. It could be 'shared' where the Jeeps could be made available for the seats and 'private' where the Jeeps could be could reserved just for yourselves. We are unable to cater your request to add you to a private jeep that was reserved by your group with specific instruction of only adding their 4 personals.

We understand that the price point could have been high for you but we can guarantee you that we run at a competitive price within the region amongst our competition. We hope you will return one day to enjoy the sightings of our elusive leopards at Yala.

Until next time, we wish you all the very best.

The hotel supported this as their policy is that people could refuse to allow others to ride in a vehicle with them. This at no additional charge, because when I asked if the two couples had paid for six seats, the answer was no. From a business standpoint, I find this to be ludicrous as empty seats are lost income to the hotel. From an “I came here to see leopards” standpoint, I find it very disappointing.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala. 

Thank you for choosing to stay in Cinnamon Wild Yala and following up with a review taking up your time and effort. Your feedback is invaluable for us to understand our positives and areas of improvements. We are disappointed to note that our service standards and food quality did not match your expectations. 

Our award winning culinary team rarely disappoints the guests. It is further intriguing to hear the cleanliness standards were not up to your expectations either. After an internal review, we do understand that we could have created opportunities to understand the expectations further as there were only two recorded attempts to hear of your stay. We will surely look to a way to improve our communication for our future guests. 

We are of course privileged to have our location strategically set up as one of the closest to the famous Yala National park. Thank you for appreciating it and writing about it to our guests who will read this review before reserving their stay. Once again, I would like to apologize to you both for not meeting your expectations. 

On the other hand, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your honest feedback which we truly believe will elevate our standards further in the future. We hope this visit will not be the reason to not repeat your visit again. We most certainly expect to see you again at Cinnamon Wild Yala to enjoy our improved experience. 

Until next time, we wish you the best.

Unfortunately, it was the worst stay in my life in a hotel and it was my 5th staying in Cinnamon wild Yala. I requested one triple room and one double  room. However they reserved us twin bed  instead of double king size bed. So I requested them in very kind manner to do the needful, to change the twin bed to double king size bed because my little son has never slept on a single bed alone.Assistant Manager Wathsala treated me extremely rude manner and she said that she can only do make together twin bed, other than that, they can not do anything.She was the rudest hotel staff I have ever seen in my life. Pradeep also support to Wathsala to her rude behavior. Then I went to front office, the front office manager Roshani handle it very pleasant way and she offered us just next room with king size bed. 
Ultimately I want to express that Roshani ,Saman Senanayake ,Exe. Sous Chef Nandana Perera, Manjula ,Malintha ,Dilani and other all staff treated us very well. In addition except Assistance Manager Wathsala and Pradeep, all other staff apologies for the situation.

I’ll start with the positives though… 

- Cool location (surrounded by wildlife, crocodiles etc which I liked) 
-Nice staff generally in the dinner Restaraunt
-Room was clean and nicely decorated 

Now negatives

- Very expensive for very average quality. We had lunch from the a la carte, I ordered the “BBQ Chicken Hawaii sandwhich” and I got a ham and cheese toastie with a side of ketchup (no bbq to be seen) 
-Dinner was average compared to rest of Sri Lanka and expensive per person 
- We booked an afternoon safari with the hotel & it was rubbish - our naturalist said two words throughout the entire trip and it was $90 euro per person!! Avoid at all costs 
- Next day we checked out, we had trouble finding a driver to take us to our next destination, asked the front desk if they can help us and they said to wait. 1 hour later no one asked us if we found something and they didn’t even bother to look for a driver for us to start with! Luckily we found one ourselves. 

Overall, we spent over $600 for one night and it was genuinely very bad and not worth it. The service is robotic, they dont really bother and the second you check out they care even less.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you for expressing your sentiments based on your experience with us at our Wildlife resort. We value your feedback and we surely do understand that it could be daunting to go through the jungle amidst heavy rain with the roads not being as smooth as one could hope for. However, this is the experience in the jungle and we are happy to hear you experienced it. We do understand that it is not everyone's cup of tea, I am sure majority will understand when coming to a resort inside a jungle and is based on Wildlife.

In terms of the extra bed, we do provide extra bed upon reservation. As a resort with individual chalets within the jungle, our services to provide extra beds in the middle of the night does take some time when it rains. However we are also informed that the request was told to be left off as it was past bed time. We would like to apologize for the inconvenience that may have been caused. 

On the other hand, thank you for informing about your experience to the management as it provides us a platform to see what could be done for the future. Once again we value your feedback and we sincerely hope to provide a better experience in your next visit to Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Until next time, we wish you all the very best. Stay safe. Cheers.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Firstly, thank you very much for taking your time to review Cinnamon Wild Yala. We believe your effort will help us motivate our associates, improve our standards and encourage more tourists to visit our beautiful island and in particular to our destination in Yala.

Thank you for informing about your experience with us at the Wild. Firstly, we would like to apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused during your stay and the management will revisit the entire stay to understand the effect better. However, a few of the points would make sense to explain in this forum and we would like to explain it for you.

In terms of the luggages, we are told there was a claim made blaming the porter for dropping the bags. This is exactly why the CCTV was checked to ensure if there was any luggage drop from your chalet to the reception. In the case there was a fall, the resort would have compensated to it without a shadow of a doubt, just like airlines do. Furthermore, while handling both your luggages, a trolley was used with no other interference from other guest luggages as well. Hence we were very sure it was not a handling issue from the resort end. Once it was checked thoroughly, it was declared there was no fall or any accident from the chalet to the reception. This was communicated to you by the Front office team later with support to cover the luggage with duct tape.

Secondly, upon revisiting your stay, we are surprised to hear that you were not told about the facilities nor the beach. However to note, while we are unable to certify otherwise, we can be very sure about the information paper which we have given to you (which is given in addition to the verbal welcome brief) upon check in. This includes all the details about the facilities and the house rules.

Once again, thank you for raising the concerns with the intention of improving our standards and we would like to once again apologize for the inconvenience that was caused in trying to meet your expectations of the stay.

We hope to see you again soon. Until next time, we wish you all the very best. Stay Safe. Cheers.

- Ananada makes a lovely cocktail, his ambarella chutney cocktail is a must try.
- You are in the middle of a jungle
- Nice aesthetic

Cons
- Damaged our suitcase, instead of accepting that this is unfortunate and offering compensation the manager was very intent on the fact nothing could be seen on CCTV. The point is that the damage had occured because of their handling whether it could no be seen on CCTV or not as they couldn't zoom into the large crack. This is not the service of a 4 star resort. They were more concerned about not being to blame than actually managing the problem at hand. I asked for it to be covered in duct tape and this was only half done initially. 

- You're in a jungle so noisy at night and walls are thin so can hear everything

Hard to fault beyond their not being adequate privacy with the bathrooms. No one wants to hear their partner in the bathroom!

Disappointing food - very little care or attention to detail for vegetarians.

Last nights buffet dinner:

One tiny vegetarian pizza every 10 minutes split amongst 100+ diners. Literally as soon as the pizza was placed on the buffet, it disappeared. I spent 20 minutes loitering and eventually got a 7cmx7cm square slice that wasn’t properly cooked or seasoned. Very poor.

Salad bar - full marks.

Vegetarian mains: 
No egg kothu rotti or plain vegetable kothu rotti in Sri Lanka is unforgivable. String hopper kothu is a cheap less effort alternative. If your chefs are too tired to make a light onion gravy in order to make a veg kothu rotti - they should find new jobs.

I asked the chef for a normal veg kothu rotti whilst he was making more meat kothu even though the dish to store it was already full. He said he couldn’t. Why - I have no idea. Laziness?

Channa curry - channa was not cooked through. Also the spices were still semi-raw and it was like eating a can of chickpeas in tomato soup. A number of diners complained that you were serving channa and korma but had no Indian breads to accompany it. Where is the naan, roti, chapati, dosa??

To the chefs of cinnamon wild. It is 2023. The world is not just Brit/Americans from the 1950s after a roast meat.

The amount of meats on offer compared to the vegetarian mains is inexcusable and diminishes your brand. No paneer, no veg skewers, no tofu, no soya meats. It is 2023. Lift your game.

Sri Lanka is thought of as a food lovers paradise but I have been really, really disappointed. You can’t keep getting away with spiceless noodles and bread rolls and dhal for your vegetarian guests. 

I love the hotel but am really disappointed in the food. That is a significant part of the experience. At this price point and for this brand - I expect better. Your chefs need to be fired and hire people who understand that every medical doctor in the western world advocates that their patients eat meat less than once/week for basic health reasons. Literally after every colonoscopy I perform, I say the same thing to my patients. 

Do better. Make as much effort for vegetarians as you do for meat eaters and be as creative or more!

Firstly, thank you very much for taking your time to review Cinnamon Wild Yala. We are disappointed to hear you had an unsatisfactory stay with us. We would like to apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused during your stay. As the Resort manager I remember talking to you on a few of these points and I would like to make a note of them for your reference.

Starting with the bad attitude of the associates, you mentioned two incidents. Firstly of them not requesting but ordering you to go and sit in the lobby. Secondly, having no assistance when you arrived to the swimming pool area and approaching the reception once again. As a professional organization we take these complaints very seriously including checking CCTV footages with audio coverage, not just to check validity but also to correct each other and go forward as a strong brand.

Upon the total investigation we found out that the check in process happened well within 15 minutes and there was no rude remark made by our reception team. In fact, it is usual custom to ask our guests to sit and enjoy the cold towel and the welcome juice while we prepare the on arrival processes. In addition, contradicting your words, we found that there was a pool attendant in the swimming pool. When you approached the reception two associates immediately came forward to attend to your need and set up the pool beds. We have also investigated further on the food aspects. We understand that you did not like the burger that you had ordered.

Finally, we would like to request you to make remarks after thorough investigation in terms of environmental pollution. The resort depends on its natural surroundings and wildlife. As an organization we perform all our activities with the least damage to the environment and stand out as one of the few resorts who also initiate environmental protection activities.

We do understand that your stay did not match your expectations and we truly are disappointed about it. We hope to ensure we further improve where necessary to ensure everyone feels welcome in the future.

Hope you have an amazing experience in the remainder of your vacation. Stay Blessed. Cheers.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan

Restaurant unable to cater to the large crowd in the hotel, food not refilled, people in queues at action stations waiting for food for a long time. Staff unable to provide prompt service for guest needs. As we complained on the first night, there was more attention given to us the next day but that should not be the approach.

Otherwise, we never thought of going to this hotel. It was the worst customer service ever. At the checkpoint, we realised the hotel had given the security guard the incorrect name, and he was rude as we were not on the list. However, after we sternly told him that we got a booking, he allowed us to enter. Then at the hotel, the front office staff girl was rude to our driver by saying he had no accommodation and had to go to the town to find accomodation. She told the driver, ""there was a bed bug issue"". It is an occupational health and safety issue. When we asked the girl, she said the same thing and could not provide accomodation to the driver because of the 'bed bug issue'. However, when my husband asked about the issue, she tried to argue by raising her voice. So I said it is no point in staying in a hotel like this with very poor hospitality. So we decided to leave without check-in but asked for the duty manager. Then so called duty manager came. The other front office staff briefed our situation by mimicking and having that sarcastic smile. What hospitality is that because she has to inform everything, not in front of us? It is very disgusting. I used to work in the hospitality industry in Australia for a worldwide hotel group in a senior position and travelled to many countries and stayed at luxury hotels. 

The front office manager mentioned a different story and said it was related to an electrical issue caused by elephants. So when we asked why you are telling two different stories, he said this is what happened. I don't know what type of hospitality this is because this is their local brand ego, and they think they are always right and the best hospitable people. My mother was there as well, and she was shocked to see such hospitality because she travelled and stayed in hotels in Europe and Australia, but Cinnamon did not even think of senior citizens. How could you ask the driver to leave us middle of nowhere? 

His attitude was the same when we called the FO manager after returning to Colombo. One intriguing thing he said was that we know what type of business we are doing and mentioned the business type. Then my husband asked how do you know? Then he said, we google searched our details. He was on speaker phone, and another staff member (our company) was with us. He was shocked by hearing that because how could a hotel google search about someone? He invaded our privacy as a guest. Luckily we did not stay in this hotel. You can imagine, they search our details online and ask the driver to go far away from us—such a scary place. We are citizens of Australia, and as the Australian Government still labels Sri Lanka as a high alert to travel, these unprofessional staffs ruin the whole Hospitality and Tourism Industry in Sri Lanka.","Fake Hospitality","2022-11","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r870906150-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

I am very sorry if you feel we treat you bad. We never select our guest according to country, religion, skin color etc. Your case was different. You have asked for a day outing and as our resort is not welcoming short time guests and are not giving for day outings for foreigners as well Srilankan guests. Because of that we had to refuse your request. That's why I asked you to select another hotel, Hence  we cannot break our policies.

Thank you

Well when I went their to see the rooms since I haven’t heard about this place as I used to live closer to this hotel when I was living in Sri Lanka . 
Well Milani was at the lobby. I was told by her saying they don’t welcome locals. As a person who is holding dual passport I was shocked. I didn’t tell her I’m dual passport holder. I asked her booking websites doesn’t mention it’s for excluding locals. Milani told me we take only Japanese.  I was penalised by this staff member. I had a booking with Trip advisor suggestion by hotel.com for three days and today was the cut off day for me to do a free cancellation.
I didn’t want to spend my money on this place simply because of Milani
. Then I decided to complain about her to the manager Kanchuka. Until he arrived I visited two rooms. The floor was very dirty. I wonder it’s for Japanese. As Japanese love it clean.He didn’t listen to my request. Milani was smiling and didn’t show she was sorry. I told Kanchuka I have a reservation with the hotel for three days I’m planing to get treatment and massages when I arrive with my partner. He didn’t expect that his staff Milani was wrong. He told me he is the boss so he won’t allow a local to stay in this hotel. He asked me to go and find another property. I feel sorry for the owners as they don’t know how this staff ill treat customers. They lost good 1000$ from me just like that as I was planing to spend. I asked for a higher management contact details at least an email address. Kanchuka said he won’t give me. And he used filth on me and asked me to leave the property. I’m planing to complain this to relevant authorities in Sri Lanka. I’m going to take this up as I was threatened and insulted by his manager and his staff. In service industry Customer need to be treated like a king. The staff is far from that. If you are a brown or if you are locals get ready get thrown out of the hotel or get step mother treatment. 
If they don’t want locals they should advertise it’s not for locals or people who look like locals. Anyone book hotels from any booking website.

The photos look superb so when we read the good reviews, we thought going to a real nice and relaxing place… but WRONG!!!

I just don’t understand all the good reviews about this place actually. Something is wrong or guests just don’t care about relaxing and hygiene.

Bear in mind, once you book and pay, you will never get your money back.

Positive points: 
1- Very kind and helpful staff working there doing their best  with smile & professionalism.

2- The place looks quite nice.

Negative points where only management can improve despite the very good job of the staff:
There is no water pressure so if you are lucky, you can take a shower if not, you just don’t wash…!
The bed linen, the towels, beach towels, the pillows and mattress are old and smell so bad and they urgently need to be replaced. We were sneezing non stop and our nose were congested during all our stay because of this humidity and damp smell.
The breakfast is passable.
Some lights in the terrace are not working.
A lot of small insects in an old box where they put the teas & coffee so forget about having a tea in your room. Also so many small insects everywhere on the tables and plates while having breakfast.
The wardrobes are very smelly also so if you decide to hang your clothes, your clothes will end up smelly.
One of the AC was not working properly and just stopped & leaks.
The curtains are dirty.
They had this great idea of putting a jacuzzi outside in the terrace but looks very old and not working properly, plus with no water pressure, you will have to wait ages to fill up the old jacuzzi so forget about relaxing as you end up only frustrated.
Internet has very low coverage and in the terrace and by the pool, it’s not working.
There is not much sun-bed to accommodate all the guests so if it’s busy, you will have to find a solution elsewhere in the city.
The cheap plastic toilet brush looks very old and dirty.
For a family, they give you a tiny bottle of shower gel, shampoo & conditioner, so don’t forget to bring all your toiletries with you, like toothpaste and other vanity because there isn’t.
The swimming pool looks nice but it’s not adapted for kids. It maybe be ok for adults if they be careful but kids need to be supervised to avoid any incident.

So if you expect relaxing in a beautiful house as shown on the photos, it will never happen because we just didn’t during all our stay out there.
For the first time, in our Sri Lanka Hollidays, we were very happy to leave the place.

The only issue as you are aware is that your parter and yourself wanted to check out at 11 PM instead of 12 noon, 11hour past check out time. You informed us that your flight was at 3am the next day. We had informed you that we were only able to offer an extended late check out until 2 pm as there was a private villa buyout. After mentioning this to you, you agreed to leave your bags at the villa and return to collect them at 6 pm.

However at 3.30 pm, your partner and yourself were both still in the pool and refused to leave. Our Management tried very hard to explain to you again that we had a full villa buyout of one group who were enroute to the villa. It took 2 calls from Agoda to persuade you to leave. The two of you eventually left close to 5 pm after showing your temper and breaking our glass whale ornament. This ornament had been with us since we launched our business in 2018.

Mr.Stutzenstein, you are right our staff are very polite and accommodating. They find it difficult to manage intransigent guests. I am certain you understand that should you have a flight at 3am the next day, you should book an additional night and not book to check out a day earlier and then expect to stay on.

We hope you adopt this civil practice for your future stays and not impose on other hoteliers.

Firstly before we address each one of your misrepresented facts, we would like to state that we are too more than happy to share the email exchanges with anyone and this will establish the facts.

The facts are as follows.

On March 10th, you sent us an email requesting for our room rates to which we responded to that day itself providing you with full information on our villa including food, accommodation, facilities, rates and requirements by the Sri Lankan authorities for your quarantine. In addition to that we had to respond to many emails with over 30 questions.

You will appreciate that we answered every one of your questions politely and in a timely manner as confirmed by you. To the extent that we even answered questions on the costs of coffee, tea and juice. You stated that laundry should be included in a ‘full board’ package and we explained that laundry is not included but is charged at cost by a third party launderer.

On March 11th, after we had supplied you with all the required information for you to arrive in Sri Lanka, you sent us an email stating that you had read online that the 14-day mandatory quarantine was not mandatory and guests could choose to leave after the 3rd or 4th day. You wanted us to confirm this. We responded and informed you that we were not aware of any such changes to the 14-day quarantine. In fact at that time, it was still mandatory. We advised you that if you were unsure to contact the Sri Lankan authorities.

Mr Keenoo, we also offered you an upgrade to our Suite. You mentioned that your wife and yourself are vegetarians and our Chefs started preparing a 14-day menu specially so you would be spoilt for choices.

You confirmed your booking and asked us to send an invoice and payment link. You subsequently asked us to amend the invoice twice as you wanted it in a specific format to present it to your employer for reimbursement. We had to send a number of payment links which kept expiring and eventually we had to inform you that we could no longer hold the room if payment was not received. Only then did you inform us that you found an alternative accommodation to which we responded saying we expected this as each payment link we sent was ignored.

We wished you a pleasant stay in Sri Lanka and were happy you found a hotel better suited to you. It is unfortunate that you are able to unilaterally mispresent facts and are attempting to affect our business.

We are sorry that you felt the need to write us a terrible and false review.

With best wishes,

I engaged into e-conversations in view to confirm my booking at this villa in March 2021 but I am glad that I didn’t confirm the booking. 

I engaged into e-mail exchanges with Priyanka Kumar and V. U Kumar, who manage the villa and the reservations. I think we exchanged more than ten emails. I have been asking numerous questions in the emails in order to have a clear picture of the facilities and services offered by the villa, and to clear any other related queries prior to my stay. Priyanka Kumar has been responding to my queries. 

I was on the verge of making the payment to book my stay but eventually, I had to choose another 5-star hotel for several reasons. I wrote a humble email to Priyanka Kumar to advise her that I shall not be proceeding with the booking. 

To my biggest disappointment, I received a response from U V Kumar on 11 March 2021 stating “We expected this anyway” and that’s all. I was utterly shocked by such an unprofessional and discourteous approach. I replied back, in order to explain U V Kumar that when a person decides to confirm or not to confirm a booking in his villa, the person must be treated with dignity and respect. Priyanka Kumar then bounced back with a long justification, and mentioning that they have experience in this domain and they know who will confirm or not confirm a booking. I found this unacceptable.

When I was in Sri Lanka, I explained this incident to other hotel managers and hospitality experts and they all strongly condemn this approach.

I have no objection in sharing the said email exchanges with those who might be interested to read through.

Based on such a disrespectful, unprofessional and discourteous of the villa, I strongly advise people not to opt for this villa.","Unprofessional, discourteous and disrespectful","2021-05","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r788349201-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We ,Cantaloupe & Co,as managers of Sielen Diva express our deep regret and sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment we have put your family and you through.We take full accountability for this error.
 
You had booked and paid for 2 suites.We unfortunately had a system  booking which resulted in a double booking for one of the 2 suites. We should have,when realising this error,called you immediately to inform you and offer alternative options at a reduced cost or,if not 
 satisfactory to you,a full refund.There was a mistaken belief that an  offer on arrival of an alternative similar suite would have been 
 acceptable to you.
 
You had arrived at just after 3pm and rejected the alternative suite together with the one originally booked.The Villa Manager contacted the owner ,who lives in South East Asia,and was then first made aware of your disappointment and understandable anger.The owner then spoke to you and offered you the alternative suite at no cost and with full complimentary board for the duration of your stay.You informed the owner 
 that you would consult your family but the decision was to seek alternative accommodation.

On finding alternative accommodation you spoke 
 to the owner at 5pm requesting a refund in US Dollars.You messaged your bank details to the owner at 5.09pm.At 5.13pm the owner remitted the full refund in US Dollars to your account from his personal overseas bank account.The owner immediately sent you a screenshot of the remittance confirmation from his bank.The head of operations then sent your family and you to the alternative accomodation.At 6.35pm the owner 
 sent you a message of apology and offered a complimentary night stay in the future.This offer still stays.
 
We understand that the attempts to alleviate your disappointment cannot take away the error made and for this we are deeply sorry.
 
 We sincerely hope you give us an opportunity to host you for a complimentary night for 2 suites with full board at Sielen Diva.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd, Talpe 80615 Sri Lanka","Talpe","Sri Lanka","80615",," 776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd",,"15050754","5.998871","Talpe, Galle District, Southern Province","80.270584","Sielen Diva","208","4.9","4","0","1","6","197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3198032-d15050754-Reviews-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.sielendiva.com/","2018-12-21","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sielen Diva was very unprofessional in our experience.

I rarely leave bad reviews, but I feel compelled to warn others about Niyagama House. What was marketed as a peaceful luxury retreat turned out to be one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had in Sri Lanka.

The location is extremely remote and hard to access. Once you’re there, you’re basically stuck — no nearby restaurants, shops, or transport options unless you pay a premium. The so-called luxury room was outdated, poorly ventilated, and far from the “boutique comfort” they promote. The bed was stiff, the bathroom smelled damp, and basic amenities like Wi-Fi and hot water were unreliable at best.

Staff interactions felt robotic. There was no warmth or effort to make us feel welcome. Every request felt like a bother to them. The food? Uninspired, repetitive, and definitely not worth the price. You’re charged like it’s fine dining but served like it’s a low-effort hostel kitchen.

We chose this place for the yoga and spa offerings — but again, total letdown. Yoga sessions were generic and rushed, with no personalization or guidance. The massage felt like someone just going through the motions — zero sense of professionalism or serenity.

What could have been a tranquil, wellness-focused stay turned into a frustrating, isolating experience. We checked out feeling more drained than when we arrived.

I wouldn’t recommend Niyagama House to anyone looking for value, comfort, or authentic hospitality. There are far better options in and around Galle.","Overhyped, Isolated & Disappointing — Poor Service, Bad Food, and Zero Comfort at This So-Called Retreat","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r1005468338-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

thank you very much for taking the time to write this review and thank you for mentioning all the PROs that you liked.

Concerning the CONs I am deeply sorry that it seems that you just picked the wrong hotel, spending almost 2.000 USD for your week with us, booked on an OTA and accepting the price that was offered there, maybe assuming that we are an All-Inclusive model, which we are not.

WIFI: You did use our WIFI very often during breakfast time, doing long online interviews or talks with customers, which was actually really annoying for our other guests... next time I would offer you to place a working table in our library (with working internet ;-).

Water & soap: I apologize for the missing hot water and the soap replacement (""we never had enough"" actually sounds like some kind of GREED from your side ;-) - this really was a mistake from our housekeeping. It would have been solved immediately by letting me know on day one, as I am the one doing the guest relation in our house.

Your point with a dark room on the one side and that it was not dark enough on the other side I can't understand. Sorry. We have blind out curtains in the rooms facing the sunrise. Your room was facing the sunset.

Our place is in the middle of nature and therefore so quiet at night, that the AC sound sometimes seems louder than it really is - we have them checked regularly, including a check of the decibel. Of course, it can happen that there is a little ant or another animal in the room, as we are not in New York City and as we don't want to use pesticides just to prevent this from happening.

Beach towel: you take a towel and bring it back, we wash it. You want a new towel, we have to wash this also. Simple mathematics and just two dollar per towel. or the option to keep the same towel for one week.

Transportation: luxury places do offer you the own driver and your own car. No obligations, take an UBER or one of the offers in Galle Fort or the local bus :-). I did not charge you for canceling our transport two days before your departure :-).

Special dinner: I allowed you to change your Christmas Menu (80 USD per person is not sooo over the top, right?) and even have you had one portion curry to share - we make it possible. And there was no duty to stay for the New Year's Eve dinner, where there was even a cocktail, a glass of sparkling wine and fireworks included in this price.

Water: we do offer bottled water in your room free (one bottle per day) and hot water is also free - as much as you can drink, as well as tap water. Sorry for charging a little amount for additional bottled water. Try hot water, it's very healthy :-).

I wish you for 2020 all the best and only the hotels that are really matching to you. In case you are looking here on Tripadvisor for the best value in Galle and also in the whole Southern Provine: you can find us in both rankings on place no. 1 ;-))).

All the best and take care,
Elke

I would recommend folks shopping at this price point strongly consider a different hotel.

Pros:
+ beautiful grounds
+ very comfortable pool
+ nice breakfast
+ helpful staff
+ relaxing atmosphere 
+ hotel organizes tuktuks to the beach for a reasonable price

Cons:

- the price point for the quality and generosity of the service and experience is ridiculously expensive for what you get. The place seems to position itself as “high end luxury” where in reality the WIFI sucks and barely works, the hot water only worked 40% of the time despite alerting the staff, the AC was loud and noisy hurting your sleep, there are insects in the room, the rooms are very dark, and there are no true black out curtains. 
- Greed. We understand there’s a mark up for services at hotels, but everything seemed to come with a ridiculous mark up. For example, we originally asked the hotel to organize a taxi transfer for us and then found out they charged us 2x the rate we booked in town. There was a fee for using beach towels and they charged us for washing the towels each time too! They attempted to provide special meals for Xmas and NYE at about 5X the in town price (equivalent to a high end restaurant in NYC). There was a fee for getting water with your already paid for breakfast (!!!). Finally, they don’t even replace the soap in the shower, we had to keep asking and never had enough. 

Overall, I would recommend this place either shapes up their offering to meet the price point, or really brings down the prices. In addition, treating your customers as wallets doesn’t really generate good will.

Here comes some advise from the greedy, unfriendly owner Elke:

1.)	If you travel with an infant PLEASE check the hotel policies… yes, it is written on pages like Agoda.com or Booking.com, but all the way down after the beautiful pictures of the place in order to sell it better ;-))).
2.)	If you claim to be a hotelier yourself, you are already knowing that we don’t get your contact details, because Agoda prefers to keep them for themselves. So maybe don’t book just three days before (no no no… it was NOT two MONTH before…). The Agoda help team guys always doing their best to transfer my message to guests who can’t read the policies, but if the guests don’t have internet access – whom to blame?
3.)	If the manager AND the owner are trying to explain to you that you can leave free of any charges at lunch time, as we  want to be friendly by making an exception (because NOT seeing our “No-Kids-below-12” policy was NOT our mistake…), don’t wait another 5 hours in the hotel lobby, waiting for some miracle happening from the Agoda side. Just be happy that you don’t need to pay a single dollar and choose another hotel, so that you can enjoy the rest of the day.
4.)	In case you have this extremely bad experience with a hotel, maybe don’t write a review on Tripadvisor, because the owner really enjoys to write an answer ☺.
5.)	Especially don’t burn your blood by answering two months later (yes… this is approximately two months ago…), still being sooo angry… Life is short and it makes more fun to be happy.

I wish all friends and future friends of Niyagama House happy traveling (> don’t forget to check the hotel policies – It’s worth it ;-).

Best regards from the tea plantation,

Elke (not Erica ;-) de Silva

After 6 hours of travelling and reaching this hotel in the evening I was simply denied check-in by Mr. Prasad, the front office manager post having a confirmed booking from agoda. The reason given was that I was accompanied  by an infant and kids are not allowed at Niyagama house. While making the booking 2 months prior to travel date, I had clearly mentioned that I was accompanied by an infant. Also in agoda site no such information was mentioned. 

Due to very poor cellular connectivity we were unable to get in touch with agoda to shift our booking to some other hotel we requested Mr. Prasad to assist us finding a new hotel in Galle. But they bluntly refused. Post that added to our misery was the entry of owner Erica d Silva, who by no chance behaves like a hotelier. Super arrogant, rude and recommended us not to take kids along on holidays. She told us that since our booking was done via agoda we were a guest of agoda not niyagama house. According to agoda it was hoteliers (Erica's)greediness to generate more business from online portals by hiding hotel policies. She could have updated the kids policy from her end on agoda site however for her generating revenue was more important than guests comfort. Even after knowing that she had denied rooms to many guests in the past. 

After 5 hours of waiting with an infant child agoda shifted us to tamarind hill which was simply immaculate.

first of all: thank you very much for the good advice concerning the cheese. This was already on my To-Do-List and now we offer fresh cut slices from a tasty block cheese, made in Sri Lanka.

Now to the size of the room and massage room: You are a really tall guy, so I can understand your impression. But we have photos of our rooms on our website (even with square feet information), so you should have booked a bigger room that matches your impressive stature. And when I have a massage, my eyes are almost the whole time closed ;-). But: the posh Spa Bungalow will hopefully be under construction soon.

Now to the massage towels: as English is your mother language I was really wondering that you did not understand, what you signed on your Spa voucher. Green oil = please use green towels and not the whites ones. Is that so difficult? And please: in the end you did not pay a single rupee for destroying several white towels. We just gave in to your not-understanding...

In the end I am happy for a bad review, so that interested people don't think that we pay for all the good ones :-)))!

May your future travels be full of huge rooms. All the best,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are sorry to hear that your experience did not fully meet your expectations. We strive to provide a high-quality Ayurvedic and yoga retreat experience, and we appreciate your detailed comments, which will help us improve.

We would like to clarify that Panchakarma is a long-term process and cannot be completed within a short stay, which is why our doctor recommended a suitable detox for your visit. Our therapists are well-trained and dedicated, and we usually receive positive feedback about their treatments. However, we will certainly review your concerns to ensure consistency in quality.

Regarding excursions, we always aim to provide fair pricing, but we understand your concern and will look into how we can improve transparency. We also take note of your suggestions regarding the yoga sessions and dining arrangements to enhance the overall guest experience.

While we regret that our retreat did not align with your expectations, we appreciate your constructive feedback and will use it to improve. We hope you find a retreat in the future that better suits your needs.

Wishing you the best on your wellness journey.

I’m 48 and a solo traveller. I have been to a few yoga retreats before as I find it a good way to connect with other solo travellers; but that was not the vibe here. I’ll break my experience into sections.

Facilities
The hotel looks excellent, very clean, my room was beautiful with a lovely sea view, cannot fault it. The pool was well maintained and clean.

Food
As expected at an ayervadic retreat, it was a little bland but there was a decent range of choice and dosha types were well signed. Could have benefited from being clear if something contained dairy as some items said lactose free but I wasn’t sure that they were dairy free. The waiting staff were friendly enough….more so on last day and night!

Pool area
The attendant worked so hard and was genuinely friendly. 

Trips
There were a few advertised included excursions but I saw no evidence of the guided beach walk, and temple visit was on my last day but not the Sunday I arrived so I missed that.
I also asked them to arrange a whale watching trip for me which they charged $150 for. I looked it up on Viator and it retailed at $50 so I refused to pay 3x the amount. The hotel said the tour company gave them prices and I’m inclined to believe that was partly true, plus they added their own mark up. In the end they agreed I should pay $90… not ideal, but still better. If you want a trip, book directly, they do free hotel pick up on all boat trips from Mirissa.

Treatments
Now these might be ok if you have never had proper ayervadic treatment but, if like me you have, you will be awfully disappointed. The therapists are very overworked and it shows. I’d be prepared to bet they had a 2 day training course in massage as each treatment was more about how much oil they could cover me in rather than any focus on energy flow etc. the therapists were all very nice though and did their best so I feel unkind saying this. Also there is a sauna treatment which is basically a coffin with a head hole, it looks beautiful but I’d suggest if you are slightly claustrophobic, ask the therapist to stay in the room, as I was left sweating in it for 10 minutes and had to shout for someone to come  and let me out (now I’m British, we aren’t big on speaking up, so this was not easy!) 

Yoga
The Teacher said some informative things but he repeated himself 3 or 4 times while different people arrived in each class. May I suggest he types some information on the 8 limbs of yoga, asanas, pranayama and the nadis so it can be included in a welcome pack to save him repeating it? In a 1 hour class, we only got off the mat for about 10 minutes so not the flow you might be expecting. The evening is more breath work which I enjoyed more but found difficult to sit for 1 hour due to my own injury.

Local area
It is not actively encouraged to leave, I can see why. I would have preferred advice such as, if you want to go to local town eat banana and drink coconut rather than feeling like I was escaping. I took public busses to local towns and had the best time there.
The small bay is also a tiny walk and is great for a swim.
I liked Galle and Mirissa. 

Dr advice
I very much appreciated the take away advice I was given, that was very helpful to take forward. 
I did a full cleanse and I’m not sure if it was a bit gimicky or genuinely good for health. There were no other panchakarmas offered other than sitting in the toilet for most of the day, so consider before you go if you would like this as I was taken aback and agreed without really considering it.

Overall 
I feel it is shiny, clean and superficially nice. The staff smile and go through the motions but there was no genuine warmth, other than the pool guy and one male therapist. People are sat to eat individually so there is no encouraged sense of community. No games or evening chats are available so it’s dinner then bed. 
I would agree it is a nice hotel but I would not recommend it as an ayervadic or yoga retreat.","Solo travelling yogi","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d15344173-r995253570-Ayurvie_Weligama_Thema_Collection-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

I have stayed at Sofia City Hotel Colombo three times before and had decent experiences, but what I went through during my most recent stay on May 2, 2025, was absolutely disgraceful – easily the worst treatment I’ve ever received at any hotel, let alone a so-called 4.5-star property.

I was accused of stealing a face towel after just a one-night stay. They held me back, delayed my day, and made me go all the way back up to my room to prove the towel was there. I even offered to open and show them my luggage, but the staff still acted like I was hiding something. This entire episode made me late for an important business meeting – completely unacceptable.

And it didn’t stop there. When I returned later that night to collect my bags, the night manager (on duty May 2, 2025) refused to let the staff hand over my own belongings. My driver waited 20 minutes while they unnecessarily held me up again, making me late for the airport this time.

Names involved: Sadhees, Mithma, and the night manager on duty. These individuals were not only unprofessional but acted with a level of suspicion and arrogance that has no place in the hospitality industry. How can people like this be employed at a hotel that claims to offer premium service?

Much worse was to come as while waiting for the car 3 guys and a Porter arrived to accuse me of a stealing a towel - I kid you not! They opened my small travelling case despite my objections and as you might expect no such towel.

The first time when me and my husband went to Riff, I was served raw chicken. They first said it’ll take 10 minutes to re-do the dish, and after the 10 minutes had passed, they suddenly said it’ll take another 15 minutes. We had only planned an hour for our lunch, so we had to leave and I had to be hungry for the rest of the day.

We tried our luck again, the second time we went to the Japanese rooftop restaurant. When we first went up, we were seated at the bar “while they fix a table for us”. We sat there for 10 minutes, without seeing any progress with our table, while there were at least 2 empty tables where we could’ve easily been seated to. Also there were groups of people coming in who got a table and service before us, even though we were there first.

When we finally got seated and served the food, it was very good. “Worth the wait,” we thought. In reality, we were hit again with a long waiting time for dessert which took them 50 minutes to bring out. The servers had little to none attention to us, we had to be the ones who made ourselves seen. 

Safe to say I’m incredibly dissapointed. I had super high hopes for this hotel as it looks absolutely stunning, but we gave it a chance twice, and it failed us both times.","May be a beautiful hotel but not a great dining experience","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r946432659-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly, we would like to apologise for this bad experience that you had during the New Year's Eve party at Riff Hikkaduwa.

We arrived at the airport and looked for our pre-booked transfer, we couldn’t see it.  We then had to go and buy a local SIM card to call the hotel to ask where our driver was, only to be told that we hadn’t booked a transfer.  Maybe at this stage a different answer could have been given .... we were then told they would get back to us ASAP - by this time (hot, sweaty and nearly an hour after landing), we just said could they sort a ride for us. We then had to go back through all our emails to find our booking and the hotel confirmation of said booking (the hotel should have done this). They then agreed that it was their error and covered the cost of the transfer.  Didn’t really deal with the fact that instead of arriving calm and cool we were hot and sweaty and fed up after a three hour journey in a basic van.
We finally arrived at the hotel and the location is perfect with beautiful views to the ocean.  We then had a lovely lunch and all was good.
However, there was more disappointment to come.  Our Room smelled musty and of drains when you ran the shower - we told housekeeping about this every day, nothing was ever done about it, the same with the shower which overflowed into the bathroom - obviously there are blocked drains somewhere which need to be sorted. Also, no toiletries were replenished at all during our stay, I mentioned again to housekeeping and whilst I applaud the fact that they use refillable containers, they really should refill them daily.  Finally, the towel service was random, one day we ended up with a damp dirty pillowcase ( not ours) left on the sofa along with one hand towel and a flannel (we hadn’t left any towels on the floor so expected to re-use the ones we had for another day!).   That being said, the rooms are a good size and the showers are really nice.  
Breakfast was another random area as far as service was concerned.  The offering here is very good with a nice selection although they should stop doing the French pastries, they do not resemble any pastry I have ever seen.  The problem comes when you expect to a) get what you order and b) expect it to taste the same as the previous day!  Every day there would be at least one thing we ordered that didn’t turn up despite asking about 5 times,although all orders appear to be keyed into a handheld device.
Dinner on our second day was not good, at best it was mediocre.  We ordered the same dish as we did for lunch the previous day, what turned up was probably leftovers from lunch, aspects of the dish were completely missing and it had a totally different taste.
We then had the worst seafood platter I have ever had, all of the items were over cooked and nothing was provided to get meat out of the crab, there were no finger bowls and no napkins and the salad that came along with it was rotten (more leftovers I suspect).
We then asked about our transfer back to the airport, to be told again there was nothing booked.  We were originally quoted LHR 10,000 this suddenly became LHR 17,000 because we were doing a last minute booking and it was via the hotel (even though we did book).  We then agreed to pay our driver direct and the price went back down to 12,000.
Whilst a number of these things are petty once they are grouped together and happen day after day they are wearing.  I don’t expect this kind of customer service from a top class hotel.
I understand they have only been open for 4 months.  However, I did not pay a discounted rate so I expected everything to be as I would expect from a 5 star hotel.
Our final disappointment was on our final day, we needed to get to breakfast at 7am (the same time it is every day) to be ready for transport to the airport at 7.30am.  This was all agreed and communicated with the hotel the day before. We got to breakfast only to be told it wasn’t starting until 7.30am (although it always started at 7am and nothing had been said about a later start).
We then asked if we could get a cup of tea or coffee which they agreed to.  In the dining room we noticed another guest was having breakfast, suffice to say the tea/coffee didn’t turn up at all and so we again complained.  We were then provided with a takeaway breakfast - not quite the same when you had had a hot drink and meal in mind.  It contained the inedible pastries!
There are other issues as well that could maybe be overlooked because of the great location if it wasn’t for the other issues. 
There is not enough wardrobe space in the rooms, they need a set of drawers at least.  Also the only mirror is in the bathroom which is annoying if you are both trying to get ready.  A full length mirror would have been nice too.
The power goes out regularly and then you need to do a ridiculous amount of trying all the switches to get everything up and running again - very annoying when it happens in the middle of the night and you wake up sweltering because the air con is off.
The lighting on the stairs is only on sometimes and because of the nature of the wood used it is sometimes difficult to see the stairs properly.
Also, there is no lounge to speak of, there are some chairs set up in the lobby but they are not very comfortable and the bar there is very rarely manned so you could be waiting a long time before you get a drink.
We did complain and the hotel very kindly supplied us with 2 free bottles of wine and some cheese and port in our rooms.  This was very much appreciated.  However, the issues still continued, it would have been so much nicer if the next day when we ordered breakfast we actually got everything that we ordered! 
I have looked at all the reviews from previous guests and I cannot believe that we are the only ones to experience these issues.  Maybe we just expected too much?
Sri Lanka is a beautiful country and the stretch of coastline where the hotel is located is perfect.  However, if you want service consistent with a 5 star hotel I would suggest you choose a different one to this.

Thank you for the time taken to share your experience  with us by selecting Wattura Resort & Spa as your preferred holiday destination.  Please note that we are extremely surprised and shocked to hear your negative comments which have been received for the first time in Wattura history for the past 3 years.  

We accept that you have stayed in our hotel and at the time of your booking with Expedia, you have made a technical error with the room category.  Therefore our systems showed your room category as Suites.  But we were able to allocate you a room with the plunge pool overlooking the Ocean.  Please note that we are Luxury Boutique Hotel where we cater to high end guests in all parts of the world and even Sri Lankans.  Since we have a Kids Water Park, many families are occupying in our hotel. Also please note that you have booked the all inclusive package on Deluxe which does not include the international sprits and beers.  But we were courteous enough to provide you beer from the Premium all inclusive package.  You will get package inclusions for what you have paid.

Please note that all other comments such as security and hotel environment, of which you have mentioned in your review are not acceptable at all. We are a newly built hotel and we have facilitated many international guests throughout these 3 years and have not received such negative feedback.  It seems that you are taking a revenge on our hotel by criticizing our facilities and services.

Having read the wondering reviews, I couldn’t wait to end my holiday here. This hotel is by far the worst one I have ever stayed in in Sri Lanka- a beautiful country which I have visited frequently over the years.

Upon arrival, the check in process was extremely unorganised. We had paid for a room with a plunge pool. We were instead shown to a riverside room with no pool. When I asked where the pool was, the employee said we hadn’t paid for that type of room. My husband had to repeatedly send proof of our booking which clearly stated we had paid for a plunge pool room. We were moved to the correct room type around 30 minutes later.

When we got the the correct room, it absolutely stunk of smoke. The furniture downstairs in the villa was extremely outdated and there were hairs all over the sofa. The kitchen area was covered in ants and hadn’t been cleaned in a very long time. When I went upstairs to check the bedding, there was lots of dead ants and insects under the sheets. The staff were quick to change this and provide an oil burner to mask the smell of smoke.

I would express major security concerns with the villas on the beach. Anyone can freely walk past and around the hotel- there are no fences or separation. On one of the days I was lying at garden area in front of the villa I was staying at. I noticed two local men walking past but thought nothing of it. The next day, they returned and we’re taking photographs of me whilst sunbathing. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable so we immediately reported this to the security and management. We were then moved room for the duration of our stay due to safety concerns. The properties have sliding doors which are extremely easy to force open.

We went to the ‘bar’- I use this term loosely as it is an extremely run down area with old discoloured furniture, we had our next disappointment. We had booked an all inclusive package. The bar tender was quick to tell us that we had very select items available to us, which I immediately spoke to a manager about. Nowhere did it state that we would not be allowed ‘premium’ (imported) beers and spirits. The manager agreed and allowed my husband to have imported beer. The staff repeatedly asked us for our booking whilst we were there to ‘check our package’.

Each night the food was average. One night there was a buffet and it was horrendous- full of children running around and extremely limited food choice. We ordered burgers from the lunch menu each day as we knew the evening food would not be good.

When we went to book a taxi to the airport, the manager tried to charge us $70 for a 20 minute journey which is daylight robbery considering we had travelled from Unawatuna (a 2 and a half hour drive) for $25 via taxi. When I complained, he said it was due to the luxury vehicle (a Mercedes van?)! We were able to source our own transport for $20. Absolutely disgusting that they could try to extort guests in this way.

The resort is old and outdated. There are mattresses and cots lying around communal areas. There are lots of ants in the rooms. There are very limited reviews on this hotel and what has been shared by others is not a true reflection. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

The only positives I could draw from the hotel are two friendly members of staff - Amindu and Jaliya.","Less than 1 star","2022-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499080-d15198149-r833061703-Wattura_Resort_Spa-Waikkal_Central_Province.html",

Stand fans were everywhere creating such a budget low class atmosphere. Gone were days of luxury once felt at the lodge. The conceirge refused to take our bags unless we paid them some money. It was like an Indian fish market ! Not the so called five star brand we thought we booked.  The rooms we got were terrible. Kettle and ac didn’t work and there was gigantic cockroach in the toilet. 
We have been staying here since the 90’s. What a loss of quality from 2020! Absolutely awful! A real  hole of a place.

But then around 12.40 one of the receptionists at the front desk asked us to get lunch till they prepare the room for us. Thats where exactly we became frustrated. Actually we should be given at least the room number or the front desk could inform the restaurant that we have been sent there by them. So what we noticed was that one of the stewards ( a tall person with a bold look) was showing us to several other restaurant stewards and kept giving us glances as if we are thieves. So very unrespectable body language was used by him. Bearing his behaviour for as long as we could , my husband asked what was wrong from another steward to whom that steward showed us at that moment. He said nothing was wrong. We complained both to the restaurant manager and the front desk. They tried to convice us that he has been looking at us cz my husband looked familiar. But why couldnt he come and talk to us then

Having stayed at some wonderful hotels during our trip , including Cinnamon Wild at Yala, this was the least welcoming and had the lowest standards of all 8 hotels. From the start there was no welcome - the check in was functional but there was no warmth, as we had come to expect from other hotels.  The room was basic, tired and in great need of an upgrade. 

If you don't want to eat buffet dinners then don't stay here! Although they advertise a la carte options these restaurants are tiny and, when we stayed, were not open! This left us with the choice of buffet menu or eating in the bar, so on 2 nights we had a burger in the bar and kne night we braved the buffet but 2 of our party had dodgy stomachs the next day.

Reception also managed to mess up our order for a packed breakfast on the morning we left, as we left before breakfast was served. Despite placing our order and specifying the time, the day before,  our breakfast was nowhere to be seen! Only after we made a fuss did it arrive but with no apology or any sense of urgency, given that we had a 4 hour drive to the airport ahead of us. This hotel lets down the Cinnamon brand

If you are staying here, please expect to have to get a tuk tuk everyday to and from the main towns such as Unawatuna. Tuk tuk drivers wait outside the hotel and charge roughly 10x the price you would normally expect to pay in Sri Lanka. They are taking advantage of the fact that this is a 5 star hotel and being so remote. These guys are allegedly nothing to do with the hotel, but conveniently sit directly outside and when you ask reception for a tuk tuk - miraculously one of the guys outside comes in to collect you. I suspect the hotel is working with them and splitting inflated profits. 

If you are considering booking a taxi to get you to and from Tabula Rasa, please don’t book with the hotel. They wanted to charge us £120 one way when in reality, this is double the price of booking a transfer through the likes of booking.com or any other reputable transfer company, which offered this service for £60 one way. This is what we chose to do as it was far cheaper. 

The food, be it fairly good, is expensive. Much more than you would expect to pay in other hotels in Sri Lanka. We opted to pay extra to have breakfast provided within our stay. You would naturally assume that water would be included at breakfast right? Well, not exactly. The hotel charges $2 per bottle of water, which I find absolutely disgraceful and disgusting. They are capitalising on the fact you need to drink water in such a hot climate. No complimentary water in the room either, this was also chargeable at $2 a bottle. An utter disgrace as you have already paid for breakfast so this should be included. 

The general condition of the hotel was tired. Flaking paint, rough edges and generally tired interiors can be seen everywhere. Within our room we had broken picture frames, marked walls and general obvious areas of heavy use. This place really does need a freshen up and refurbishment. We have since learned that the hotel has chosen to build another “premium” room instead of improving the current rooms. Very disappointing. 

Staff were pleasant. I overheard what I assume was the owner one day whilst swimming in the pool, having a go at a couple of members of staff. This was done loudly and I could hear every word. Not professional or pleasant to overhear as a paying guest. 

Cleanliness of the room was not good. We paid a lot of money for our room which was priced at $450 per night, to have it properly cleaned would have been appreciated. Instead, our room, was simply cat licked leaving dust and debris through the room each day. Also, furniture throughout the hotel and within our room was old and tired. Sweat marks cover the pool lounge cushions. We had a sofa within our room and a daybed near the window. Each of which were again covered in stains and marks. Again, more complacency from the owners in not ensuring rooms were up to standard. Very disappointing indeed. 

We mentioned to the hotel that this was our honeymoon when booking. We were disappointed to find that the hotel had not made any special efforts to reflect this. Even a simple a acknowledgement would have been sufficient, but nothing. 

Overall we were very disappointed with Tabula Rasa and felt that with some care and attention from the owners, has the potential to become a top hotel.","Not worth the money","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d15243228-r937464224-Tabula_Rasa_Resort_Spa_A_Slh_Hotel-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us. I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the distressing incident you encountered during your visit to our restaurant at NH Collection Colombo.

Your feedback is deeply concerning and certainly not reflective of the standards of professionalism, courtesy, and hospitality we expect from our team. I was both surprised and disappointed to learn of the way your concerns were handled by our Restaurant Manager, Mr. Ruwan. Please be assured that we take this matter extremely seriously.

We are currently conducting a formal internal review to understand exactly what transpired. Immediate steps have already been taken to ensure corrective action, including disciplinary procedures and mandatory retraining on guest relations and service recovery for the staff involved. We are also reviewing our buffet service protocols to ensure food temperature is monitored and maintained at all times.

On behalf of the entire team, I sincerely regret the embarrassment and discomfort this incident caused you. This is not the experience we wish to deliver to any of our guests, and I deeply regret that we fell short.

Should your travels bring you back to Colombo, I would welcome the opportunity to personally ensure your next experience reflects the high standards that define NH Collection. Please feel free to reach out to me directly should you wish to discuss this matter further.

Dear [Hotel/Restaurant Name] Management,

I am writing to formally lodge a serious complaint regarding an unacceptable incident that occurred during my recent visit to your restaurant. I was extremely disappointed and shocked by the behavior of your restaurant manager, Mr. Ruan, whose conduct was not only unprofessional but also deeply disrespectful.

During my meal, I noticed that the food being served at the buffet was consistently cold — not just one item, but every dish I sampled. As a paying guest, I felt it was well within reason to bring this matter to the staff’s attention, with the expectation that it would be addressed politely and professionally.

To my absolute dismay, when I raised this concern with Mr. Ruan, his immediate response was to raise his voice and shout at me in front of other guests. I remained calm and reminded him that this was not an appropriate way to speak to a customer. I asked him not to raise his voice and questioned if this kind of conduct reflected your hotel’s standards. Instead of correcting his behavior, he continued to argue and speak to me in an aggressive and disrespectful tone.

This escalation left me deeply embarrassed and uncomfortable. At one point, I had to ask him if I should leave my meal entirely or if he intended to continue his behavior — it was that confrontational. Eventually, your chef, Mr. Anuruddha, intervened and appropriately scolded Mr. Ruan for his behavior, at which point he finally left the scene.

While I appreciate Chef Anuruddha’s attempt to de-escalate the situation, the overall experience left a lasting negative impression on me. I came to your establishment expecting hospitality, not hostility.

I would like to ask:

What actions will be taken against Mr. Ruan for this incident?

What steps are being taken to ensure that no guest is treated like this in the future?

I strongly urge your management to provide immediate retraining or take disciplinary action against Mr. Ruan. No guest should ever be shouted at or humiliated for raising a legitimate concern — especially in a hospitality setting.

This incident has significantly impacted my view of your establishment, and I hope that you will take this matter seriously and respond accordingly.

Am Pool wurden Malerarbeiten durchgeführt. Der Barbetrieb war deshalb komplett eingestellt, Liegen wurden erst bei Erscheinen aufgestellt, überall Folie wegen der Farbkleckse. Für alles schreiben sie eine email, aber das kann nicht erwähnt werden. Auch nicht beim Check in. Das hinzugebuchte Buffet war eine wahre Enttäuschung. Das beste war das Brot, die Suppe und die gesalzene Butter. Die Kräuterbutter wurde nur als Schild dargestellt. Der Rest war zu kalt. Das Rindfleisch war zäh, selbst mit dem Messer kaum zu schneiden, die Käsesosse hatte kaum Geschmack. Die asiatischen Nudeln haben meiner Familie auch nicht geschmeckt. Das Dessert war nicht schlecht. Ich denke jedoch, draußen hätte man für weniger Geld besser essen können. Aufgrund einer Fehlinformation habe ich eine Rechnung für die Getränke bekommen (nur Softdrinks), so dass ich mit dem Manager gesprochen habe und die mangelhafte Qualität des Essens angesprochen habe. Nach einiger Zeit sagte er mir, ich erschiene ihm eine ehrliche Person, die nicht die Zeche prellen möchte. Was sich zunächst freundlich anhört, ist eine wahre Frechheit.

I had initially booked a half-board package but decided to cancel it well in advance of my stay. Despite confirming the cancellation, I was still charged for the half-board service when I checked out.

This unexpected charge put a damper on my overall experience, as I felt it was unfair and unprofessional for the hotel to insist on the charge. 

I booked through travel agent who is very good service even he tried to help to change the charges Hotel hasnt approved it very bad service from management. 

I have spoken GM secretary name mrs sherifa still she didn't give any help.

I would advise future guests to double-check their bookings and confirm any cancellations multiple times to avoid similar issues. While the hotel has its strengths, I hope they improve their customer service and billing practices to prevent such situations.

I stayed with my son  The lack of proper air conditioning made it difficult to sleep and relax in the room one of the nights event though they fixed it midnight around 4 clock.. which significantly affected my overall comfort and enjoyment of the stay.

I immediately ran to reception, and was understandably distraught 

I have spent 12hrs in police stations, and the hotel has treated me like a second class citizen. They’ve called me a liar, refused to clean my room, and have not supplied clean towels, tea/coffee, or even water 

It’s my birthday today, and I fly to Dubai to meet my twin, with no money, after spending two days shacked up in my room due to the way they’ve treated me

The decor and design looks tacky, especially the carpets, lifts and the inaccessible revolving door at the entrance. There was a non-functional security screening checkpoint. This was never carried out, unlike other hotels in the vicinity. Seems that no lesson was learnt as regards the terrorist attacks on the Shangrila, Kingsbury and Cinnamon back then.  

The staff has little concept of loyalty statuses. As a Diamond member, I was told that I had booked a 'room rate' only and breakfast was payable. Upon correction, the front office staff was defensive. Pre arrival email was not responded to, which beats me as to why one was sent in the first place. The executive lounge was a joke. A small, dingy place which smelt bad and felt claustrophobic! 

The late check-out privilege was a disappointment. Staff kept referring to a ""gazette"" from the tourism board which is inconsequential. As private entities, hotels have the call as to who is granted late check-out and till what time. The ""gazette"" is merely a directive on rates beyond the official hours. Simply put, there was no differentiation between a Diamond member vis a vis a Silver member! 

The Tonic Spa was an absolute horror. Requested to do a room charge and they insisted on verifying my identity and checking my room key. Extremely and unnecessarily interrogative. 

The saving grace was the housekeeping and the F&B teams, which maintained requisite standards. 

Will definitely be taking my business elsewhere when I'm next in Colombo. The only Accor property in Sri Lanka notwithstanding, it bears little standards of the likes of counterparts in other parts of the world. Much better off at the Courtyard Marriot or even the Hilton...

Although it maybe something small or unimportant it’s pretty annoying to have to deal with it constantly. I would let it slide if it’s just once or twice .

I am so sorry that our manager, Jesse, was not aware that you were on your honeymoon. 

For such special Guests, we always provide free cocktails before your first dinner with us; both for you, and all the other Guests, who can then toast your marriage.

We also offer all Guests the opportunity for private dining if they so choose.  According to our Guests' requests, we can provide dinner privately at the Hilltop cabana by the pool in a very romantic setting or, of course, in the privacy of your own Room.

We have had many honeymoon couples who have enjoyed their stay at Jim's and, once again, I do apologise that you were not able to have the romantic experience with us that you both anticipated.

Please accept our best wishes for your future happiness together.

I regret that this was the worst decision I made for my vacation. 

My family of 4 arrived at the villa in the afternoon on July 31st 2013. This was the last day of our 2 week long vacation in Sri Lanka. We had spent the last two weeks in properties such as Kadju House in Tangalle and South Point Cottage in Ahangama. We were expecting similar standards of hospitality and service at Jims Farm Villa.  About myself – I am an expat working for the United Nations and have stayed in several hotels and villas around the world.

When we arrived, the manager, Jesse, unexpectedly mumbled a plethora of options for rooms and rates upon our arrival, despite the fact that we had booked the entire Hilltop villa for exclusive use. While we were initially confused, Jesse later mentioned that he provided these options to us for our own advantage. So, picture 5 people including Jesse standing in the patio of the Spice Garden Villa in the afternoon heat drinking papaya juice (with added sugar) as Jesse quickly mumbles out rooms and rates options to us.  He offered us two rooms at the Spice Garden Villa for a rate of 160 USD per room half board (i.e. including dinner and breakfast).  He stated that the rate of 350 at the Hilltop villa did not include any meals, which we were already aware of. While we had booked the Hilltop villa for exclusive use, given that Jesse was the one who initiated the conversation to urge us to explore other options, we nevertheless decided to check out the rooms at both the Hilltop and Spice Garden Villas and arrive at a final decision. We were also wondering if it would be possible to book a triple room at Spice Garden Villa as that would be an economical option for us because we were planning on going on an excursion and would return to the villa late in the night.  We asked one of the boys who showed us the room to check this with Jesse. The boy returned back stating that Jesse cannot come and he wants to see us in the office.  This by itself was rude hospitability in my opinion. So, I walk to Jesse’s office where he is seated behind the desk and I opt to sit down in one of the plastic chairs in the corner.  I ask him about the triple room option and he quoted another rate without providing any breakup of the amounts.  Totally confused by now, I ask for the break up of the rates and also wanted to double check the rates in the website but I could not as there was no internet at the office. I then received a curt reply from Jesse “so you don’t trust me”.  I was shocked by this statement. Jesse then mumbled a few abusive words and said that he would not offer me any options now. He would only offer me the Hilltop Villa that I had booked for. I had to argue with him and get a clear picture of the rates while my family of 3 (including my 7 year old child) was standing outside.  This was a very embarrassing situation for me and the experience spoilt my day. I spoke to Jesse about his rudeness and he quickly apologized and provided me a clear breakup of the rates for a triple room.

The rates for Jims Farm Villa are already published in their website.  It would be beneficial to have a printed pamphlet of the room rates as well as the charges for breakfast and dinner at the office.  It would also be nice to have the guests sit down at ease when they arrive and go over the charges with them in a leisurely fashion rather mumbling rates and charges and confusing clients in a hurried manner, especially those who have booked villas for exclusive use. 

Further, no matter what, usage of curt replies, abusive language and arrogant tone and body language is just not acceptable in the hospitality industry. Jesse apologized for his behavior and mentioned “no hard feelings” to me when I was checking out.  However, this is not going to undo the damage done by him to my vacation.

The staffs at Jim’s Farm Villa are a nice bunch of young boys who are courteous, unlike their manager. We were served some delicious Sri Lankan curry and rice – the papaya curry that we had was one of the best during our trip to Sri Lanka.  

We encountered some problems with the television in our room and there was no satellite reception. The staff came but and tried to fix this but were not successful. My kid loves to watch cartoons and while it is understandable that satellite reception did not exist because of the strong wind, we asked if we could use the room next door for 30 minutes to watch TV.  The staff came by and said that the room is booked (obviously I am guessing Jesse must have told them to say that).  How could the room have been booked when Jesse has just quoted us a rate for 2 rooms few minutes ago? They offered some DVDs instead (most of the DVDs were for teenage children and exceeded the age bracket of my kid).

While the staff was very helpful, discrete hospitality is lacking at the villa. Even if harmless or unintentional, I would not appreciate 2 boys staring at us eat for the entire period of our lunch. 
This is however a minor issue (compared to the issue with the manager) and can be easily fixed.
Wireless internet was not working in our room. This is contrary to what is stated in their website. When we checked in, we saw that the bathroom in our room was full of dead insects. 

The location is nice and remote – but I enjoyed some other plantation villas much better during my vacation. Overall, given the shockingly rude hospitality of the manager and poor facilities (problems with television and wireless internet), we have ranked this place as terrible.
Please bear in mind that experiences differ from person to person. The couple in my next room seemed to be enjoying the place. There are several excellent reviews about the property and praises about the picturesque location.  However, having travelled all over the world and stayed in comparable villas, I could see a marked difference in the levels of hospitality and service.  Hospitality is not just about picturesque locations, charming tuk tuk rides across villas, and good food.  The real and genuine intent to serve matters a lot. Jims Farm Villa has the potential – only if management takes action to spruce up service levels and send Jesse back to grooming school to learn basic etiquette and customer handling skills.

No matter what response or apology to a response management provides, any prudent or self respecting person cannot expect hospitality to take such a severe beating. I thought it is important to write a candid review based on real experiences. 

I will be creating a blog/web site about my experiences in Sri Lanka as well as writing a book shortly – will surely factor in my experiences about my stay at Jims Farm Villa.
