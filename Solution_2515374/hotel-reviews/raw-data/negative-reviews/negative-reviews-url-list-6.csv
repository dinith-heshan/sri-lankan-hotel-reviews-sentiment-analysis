I’ve seen all Colombo has to offer and indeed it’s a glorious city and the people are rightly proud of this. Initially I wanted to use The Colombo Swimming Club but was denied access as I’m not a member. How ironic that it was built by expatriates to relax in. Then a British national is refused.

I then went to Thurston College Pool but was denied there as there was water polo scheduled that afternoon. So rather than spend the afternoon traipsing around the city, I headed to Ramada hotel. Known for priding itself on excellence and the finest hospitality. What could go wrong?

Everything can go wrong in this hotel. Staff greet you professionally and are courteous, kind and engaging. I pay the 2,000 rupees fee for use of the pool. I then head to the cafe for a coffee and a fruit salad. I look for a table to sit at but the only one with free seats hasn’t been cleaned. Having no choice, I sit at that table and clear the table myself. My Americano is brought to me shortly.

I then head to the poolside and as luck would have it, I have it all to myself. The pool boy takes my ticket and hands me a towel that’s in very poor condition. Bleach marks are all over it. I have no locker key to store my valuables so I bring my bag next to the sun lounger. After swimming intermittently for almost an hour, I fancy some food.

I ask the pool boy how do I order some food and beverages? He goes to the hotel and informs me somebody will be along in five minutes. Twenty minutes later a staff member approaches me without a menu and asks what I would like? He then sends a server along in three minutes with a menu. I order a cappuccino, mango lassi and a chicken caesar  salad.

The drinks are brought along first and the server goes to put them on an empty lounger as apposed to the empty table? Who trains these staff? It’s mind boggling really. After instructing him politely where to place it, he sheepishly walks off. He has no badge on his shirt so I can’t address him unfortunately. He’s pleasant enough, just really shy.

The cappuccino is probably the worst one I’ve had in my entire six months of being here. The mango lassi fares much better. Then after 6/7 minutes the salad arrives. This was merely two chicken skewers, a lot of lettuce leaves, a boiled egg and a round piece of toast with a hole in it! I ate the chicken and tossed the bread to the birds who were squawking in a nearby tree!

Poolside you can hear easy listening music by means of a piano or an acoustic guitar. I recognise several tunes as they are western classics. One of them playing was Bryan Adam’s, Everything I do, I do it for you. Fitting then that today’s visit has been exactly the opposite. It feels more like Michael Jackson’s BAD!","Atrocious.","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306381-r1014361424-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We were on international trip to Sri Lanka and stayed at Ramada Colombo from June 8th to June 9th. The reason to choose Ramada was it being an International brand. I was an in house guest, all room charges paid in full in advance. 

Me and my wife went out to the city with our son back in the room and while going out we had ordered food for him. The hotel staff asked my 11 year old son to pay for the food. He said parents are out, again after 10-15 minutes they called him multiple times on intercom to pay the food bill. 

On return, when I told them about this bad experience and requested to settle the bill at checkout—as is standard practice at most hotels, I was bluntly told “This is our policy.” It felt pushy and unprofessional, especially when one is trying to relax on vacation.

Few more things which I find negative about this hotel
- They are charging whooping 34% service charge + tax for this pathetic and unprofessional services
- When we checked into our room, there was an electrical failure. Two teams came one after the other to try and fix it, but after wasting quite a bit of our time, we were finally asked to move to another room.
- The staff overall were not welcoming — no smiles, no greetings, no basic warmth you expect from a hospitality business. This made the atmosphere uncomfortable and cold.  But, this is just at Ramada, not seen anywhere else all along our 7 day trip.
- Everytime you order something or eat at their restaurant they want payment then and there. This rigid and frankly unwelcoming approach reflects poor hospitality and a lack of trust in paying guests. It was an embarrassing and uncomfortable experience that left a bad impression

I expected better from a reputed hotel brand.
Not staying here again, and I wouldn’t recommend it to others expecting professional service and guest-friendly policies. There are definitely better options available in the city that understand true hospitality.","Disappointing Experience at Ramada Colombo - Poor policy and services!","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306381-r1012860755-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Our room was unclean, smelt badly of damp and it needed to be redecorated.

We arrived after 20hrs of travelling, quite exhausted. The reception area looked good and  we thought it seemed like a nice hotel until we reached our room

Our room on the 3rd floor was very dusty and it smelt badly of damp. Had we not been absolutely exhausted, we would have certainly complained, however we just wanted to sleep and knew we just had one day in Columbo. Over the next day I found the tv did not work, the iron was stuck on 1 temperature and the sheets were stained. I have taken a few pictures to share here but they do not recreat the smell of damp! 

In terms of service, there seem to be an abundance of staff here. Sadly though, they seem to like chatting with each other rather than serving guests. For example,  the bar was pretty much empty but I still had to remind the staff member that I had ordered drinks. 

The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that the pool was good for swimming lengths.

 
Having stayed in quite a few Ramada's in the past, and enjoyed them, I realise I cannot rely on that in future. I just wonder how these other reviews are so glowing....

Dear Ramada Management,

I visited your restaurant on 30-09-2024 for dinner and had mixed expectations. While the food quality was good, the staff service was extremely disappointing.

Specific issues:

- Staff attitude was rude and unprofessional
- Orders were delayed and staff seemed disorganized
- Staff failed to address concerns and provide timely resolutions

We brought these issues to the attention of the manager and staff on multiple occasions over the last 3 days, but surprisingly , we have yet to receive a single response or resolution. Even F&B Director also denied for the commitment given by team. Very unprofessional and rude behaviour from entire team of Ramada.

The lack of accountability and disregard for customer feedback is alarming.

As a result of this experience, we have lost confidence in the Ramada brand and will not be patronizing any Ramada hotels or restaurants globally for our future travels.

Improving staff training and customer service skills would greatly enhance overall experience.

We understand the frustration and embarrassment you felt and we apologize for any inconvenience caused. It is our aim to provide top-notch service to all our guests, including business professionals, and we regret that we fell short of your expectations in this instance. However, it is the standard practice of any hospitality establishment to request payments when a preauthorization charge is not paid beforehand. We believe that our team could have approached you more professionally & courteously and we'd certainly instruct them on this matter.

We're thankful to our duty manager, Mr. Supun, who provided you with great service and will make sure to commend him for his efforts. We appreciate your valuable feedback and will strive to improve our services to better accommodate the needs of all our guests.

We had dinner and the food was excellent but the service given was way below standard. 

There was an extra bill that we had never ordered. On top of that when we inquired whether we could have coffee after dinner, we were pushed around from one place to another. 
Finally when we asked whether we could have it at the same restaurant that we had dinner, the manager bluntly refused. 
His explanation was that a foreign group has just checked in and they need the entire restaurant to serve them. He even asked us to sit outside on a sweltering hot evening to have coffee. 
I found his attitude terribly unprofessional and not at all welcoming. 
He (Mr. Imtiyaz) really need to know that we local should also be treated equally and courteously. 
I must say another two people with him too were very rude to us. 

At this point the front office manager (Mr. Nipun) who acted swiftly asked us to follow him to the lobby and ordered us coffee from room service. He made it a point to sit with us and listen to our complaint patiently. 

I found entire staff at the front office extremely efficient including duty manager Chamith. 

I hope my complaint will get due attention and the management will seriously look into some kind of training and change the attitude of the F&B manager and their poor service in future.","Unpleasant incident had  at the Gardinia restaurant","2024-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306381-r942369483-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Very poor Customer Service. I came to drop my cousin for an interview and I was not allowed to go inside. Even if I bought goods from the cafe I was told that I get only 15 mins to stay and have to go outside of the hotel because High Tea is opening at that time. I complained about this to the duty manager today and he was trying to explain that as a customer I was wrong.
Point 1: If they are opening High Tea. They should keep a separate lounge area for the customers who will be at the coffee shop.
Point 2 : Even though I came to drop my cousin for the interview not fair to kick out guardians of the interviewee.

There was no flexibility seen by the staff when we asked for at least a choice of hot or cold beverages.  Despite being said that they will serve iced tea, we were served an ice coffee . When we inquired about the iced tea they mentioned before, they said they only serve iced coffee at high tea.  Apparently there was a miscommunication with the staff who contacted us. When it comes to the platter the pieces were extremely small , smaller than finger sized food. Savoury foods were not spicy at all and not much variation in the taste.  Lastly we were the served the lemon iced tea as promised. And it was the worst out of all, quite tasteless. And the staff was in a rush to clean the table before we even finished eating.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, we're truly sorry to hear that your stay fell short of expectations.

We appreciate you acknowledging the beauty of the property and the space, but it’s clear that several aspects didn't meet the standard we aim for. Cleanliness, pool maintenance, limited dining flexibility, and the absence of air conditioning are all areas where you had valid concerns. We’re especially sorry that you didn’t feel supported by the team, that’s something we take very seriously and are already addressing internally.

Our nature-based concept and seasonal operations aren’t for everyone, but your feedback helps us better serve all guests, regardless of where they’re from or what they’re used to. Thank you again, we’re learning from this.

I would like to share my recent experience at Kapiti. The area operates on two seasons: the off-season and the main season. We visited in April, and it seemed quite empty during our stay.

The property itself has a lovely view and plenty of space. However, the cleanliness was not up to my expectations; I found lizard droppings in both the room and the bathroom.

The swimming pool was quite neglected, filled with algae, so we opted not to use it.

As for dining options, the hotel has limited offerings. The Alacarte menu is only available from 1 PM to 3:30 PM, and outside those hours, no meals are served. The only snacks available were french friese, cashews, roasted coconut, and a couple of others. There was no room service, so I had to retrieve everything myself, and the staff wasn't particularly helpful.

For dinner, our choices were limited to a basic rice and curry dish with only one seafood option, at a cost of 3,900 per adult. There wasn’t much flexibility in the menu.

Additionally, the room lacked air conditioning, making it quite uncomfortable at night.

Whenever I raised concerns, the response was that this establishment is designed for foreign guests and aimed at embracing a nature-oriented concept.

I would recommend exploring other accommodations if you're considering a stay at this hotel.","Horrible","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r1003141460-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review. Glad you enjoyed your stay in our unique villas and cabanas. At the same time we read your discomfort about food and beverage service in your lines.

We had inquired from our F&B team and came to understand that they tried their very best to meet your special requests. I like to state that we are not normally offering room service on our 22 acre beach front property for obvious reasons.Out of curtesy and good will towards you, our staff tried to accommodate your requests to their best ability. At the time you had ordered your spaghetti, actually no spaghetti were available in our stores and also not with our supplier. As you can imagine, certain foreign food items are frequently out of stock in remote areas such as Kappalady beach, which is still a secluded fishing village and for which's beauty people especially come here.

Our menu and meals concept caters for the international market primarily. However we always try to accommodate special requests from our valued Sri Lankan guest as far as they are in our staff capacity. We have introduced fixed meal times in order to protect our kitchen and restaurant staff allowing them to get adequate breaks during their shifts. This we practice in adherence the Sri Lankan labor law. Kindly understand that we are constantly endeavour to balance between our guests special requests and our staffs welfare and rest times, whilst keeping cost at an adequate level.   

In this light kindly consider whether your overall rating about your stay is adequate. However, should you consider to stay again at Elements in the future, we would be delighted to offer you a free meal from our A la Carte menu you and your  entire family. 

With kind regards from Kappalady Beach,

First of all: Apologies for getting back so late to your review. We are sorry to hear that you didn't like your stay and the fact that there are bottles laying around and nobody of the staff was taking care of is not acceptable and does not meet the Elements standard at all. 

Food: If you could give a little more feedback of what you did not like it would help us a lot. Not enough variety? Too heavy? Bad taste? We are trying to serve fresh and tasty food. We grow most of the vegetable and fruit in our own garden, so it's sad to hear that the food was not good.

Resort dried and deserted: Rainy seasons are mainly April and November. The combination with strong wind during June and July may lead to how you describe it although I feel that ""dried and deserted"" could lead to a bit inaccurate impression. There are still hundreds of coconut palm trees on the premises but the grass may not be as green as during the winter month.

Hope that besides all you had some good kitesurfing sessions and enjoyed the rest of Sri Lanka!

If you book via booking.com and elements incorrectly charge the 10 % service charge n 4% debit card fee. Here is the process for a refund:

Dont bother talking to resort about money becoz in reality u r just a bum tourist and ur card account may still be ""open"". Scan ur bills.

When you have have left the area/country send an email saying u have been:

""overcharged and that it was unwise to cause a fuss in such a currupt, lawless country. It would also be unwise to give them my card details again once my account has been closed, as they are clearly dishonest. In the circumstances please could you refund *** USD/€ directly""

Cant imagine why Samsmith, the manager didnt cooperate sooner (two opportunities).Booking.com are very influencial!

To be fair I enjoyed my stay at Elements, and food was great, but the financial dishonesty left its mark.

On a more general note. It is always better to book without giving card details if possible (especially in Asia). Kitegarden, kalpitiya (no hidden charges) took my booking, no card needed. A nice family business, however money transfer companies can take up to a week so initiate early.

"2","379577130","en","3320843",,"Inhaber","381557374","en","2016-06-11","elements2012","Dear Mr. Lukas,

You are correct, Elements is not a kite camp, it is a boutique watersports resort. It seems that the tour operator should have recommended you a simple cheap kite camp where singles go and mingle. In winter Elements is focusing on Dolphin & Whale Watching, Kitesurfing, Stand Up Paddling in the nearby untouched lagoons, Beach Relaxation, Scuba Diving, Ayurveda and Yoga. As the only hotel in the Kappalady / Kalpitiya region we are located directly at the sea and the kite lagoon at the same time. 
You came very early in the winter-season, the wind direction was still from straight North - then the Kappaldy lagoon is not ideal as you correctly noticed. Throughout the entire year however the Kappalady lagoon has the much better and more consistent wind than Kalpitiya lagoon – especially since several large wind power plants have recently been erected in front of the Kalpitiya lagoon. All the Kite schools in Kalpitiya are there because the Kappalady lagoon was taken by the 2 first operators in Sri Lanka in the year 2008 already (Kite Kuda and Elements) 

Apologize that you have picked a harness which obviously had a weak point. The instructor should have noticed, but it probably slipped her attention. As you came very early in the season things like this can happen with a higher probability – however they obviously shouldn’t! Here we would like to mention that we have reimbursed you for all the days you were not able to kite out of pure curtesy ( even though you came on a prearranged / prepaid package)

You spoke about the rescue situation. Since the wind is in both seasons 95% side-onshore and there are absolutely no obstacles we very rarely have to rescue people. You required a number of rescues for which every kitecenter in the world would at some point charge. You lost your board for which you have not done a lost & damage insurance. So it is reasonable that an operator would charge the guest for a loss of equipment.  However we informed you that most probably your board would surface again – and a local fishermam brought it 2 days later to our kitecenter ;-)

So all in all we feel sorry that you obviously were looking for a cheap camp and ended up at Elements Resort. We will take this up with the tour operator and wish you more luck in choosing your camp the next time. With regards and best wishes,

The management

I stayed there 17 days altogether. It cost me a lot of money, since for Sri Lanka, Elements Resort is really expensive. But what i got in return was only a big frustration. Here's my experience:

- First and most important: The resort is situated at the WRONG lagoon. Its situated at the kappalady lagoon, while there is another lagoon, called the kalpitya lagoon, 20km away. As a local guy told me at my very last day: ""You were at the wrong lagoon. Specially in winter, the kalpitya lagoon is much better."" In the 17 days, there was not one single day, when i could use kappalady lagoon, while they were kiting on the kalpitya lagoon every second or third day. Thats why almost every other kite-camp is located at the kalpitya lagoon.

- The kite-instructor arrived 2 days before me. She knew as little about the conditions as i knew. So we were waiting for the wind, while on the other lagoon, they were on the water.

- The material is in a bad condition. During the first lesson, we wanted to make sure, the quick release is working. I released it. The kite just flew away, because the harness was in such a bad condition that it couldnt hold the safety leash. On top, there were no shoes in my size. This may sound picky, but for the big money i payed, i really got little.

- Its not a camp, its a family resort. If you like that, its ok there, but i wanted to go kite surfing and be together with other kite surfers. On the rare occasions there was wind, i was alone in the sea! (You couldnt use the wind on the lagoon, because there it was too choppy.) Thats not what you imagine of a kite camp, isnt it?

- The rescue team was a catastrophe. Basically, it didnt exist. It was the kitchen team! They coudnt swim, thats why they first had to put live jackets, and they came with SUP-board! The other day, when i really needed them, because i lost my board and couldnt reach for it anymore, no one was paying attention. At the end, they wanted to charge 30$ for the rescue service (the one that wasnt there, when i needed it) and for the lost board they wanted to charge 300$ plus an additional service charge of 10%. For what service exactely? (Fortunately the board was found later and i just had to pay a reward for the guy who found it.)

- The guy running the resort, the so called manager, is a real rip-off artist. I rented a car, when i later found out, that he was charging 3 times as much as i would have payed at another place!

- Theres a neighbour to the resort that has an enormous sound machine. Every night, hes listening to music on a very high level. Altough your in perfect nature, it fells like youre beside a disco. (Apperantly, the owners already talked with the guy, but they cant do much.)

- To be fair, i have to say, that the food was good, and the people owning the place are really kind and helpful, but that doesnt change the fact, that its not a place for kite surfing.","Never again, specially NOT for kite-surfing","2016-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3320843-r379577130-Elements_Beach_Nature_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Warm greetings from the sunny corridors of Aarunya!

We extend our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience experienced during your recent visit. Regrettably, a technical issue arose concerning your original booking, which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to fulfill. However, we swiftly arranged alternative accommodations of a similar standard and orchestrated a special dinner in acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused.

Upon receipt of your complaint, our dedicated team sprang into action, promptly involving local authorities to address the matter. In response, we bolstered security measures, stationing additional police guards and hotel security in the vicinity of your room to ensure your safety and peace of mind. Despite our earnest attempts to rectify the situation, we understand that you declined our offers, including alternative room arrangements and various amenities, for which we deeply regret.

In your statement, you indicated that staff members were implicated in the burglary. However, thorough police investigations, involving all on-duty staff present during the incident, found no evidence supporting this claim. Following the police inquiry, the hotel management issued a formal apology and extended a comprehensive offer of assistance to address the situation.

Please be assured that we are actively collaborating with law enforcement authorities, and updates regarding the ongoing investigation will be communicated to you as soon as they become available.

While this isolated incident is unprecedented in our history, we remain committed to the well-being and satisfaction of our guests. As a precautionary measure, we encourage all patrons to utilize the safety deposit boxes provided within each room to safeguard their valuables.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

Best Regards,

Sumeda Yasaratne

Upon our arrival, we were allocated the wrong room, which already raised concerns about the hotel's organisation and attention to detail. Little did we know that this rooms CCTV was  conveniently 'broken'.

When we were out for dinner our room was broken into and our valuables stolen. The sliding doors to our room were smashed in, leaving us not only devastated but feeling violated and unsafe. 

On request, the police were called and statements were taken. What is perhaps even more shocking than the burglary itself is the complete lack of accountability and compassion from the hotel staff. Despite reporting the incident immediately and expressing our distress, we were offered no apology or refund from the management.

It is abundantly clear to us that Aarunya played a significant role in the burglary (hotel IPAD was left in room), whether through negligence or complicity. The fact that they have not taken any responsibility for their failures speaks volumes about their priorities and ethics.

Upon speaking with locals, it's become clear, there has been previous reports of burglary at Aarunya and allegations of misconduct. If we had known this, we obviously would not had stayed. 

In conclusion, I urge everyone to steer clear of Aaarunya in Sri Lanka. Not only does it fail to provide even the most basic security measures for its guests, but its callous disregard for our well-being is utterly disgusting.","Burglary and Betrayal","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r948696281-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Dear Ms. Liuzzi,
 
We have received your review with mixed emotions. While fully expecting you to publish your thoughts, based on multiple threats and your overall mood, we certainly did not expect you to go to the extent that you have. We apologize once again, however note that we took all possible steps in our control to rectify these issues during your stay. 
While many of the issues faced by you during your stay were directly related to a bad power supply of the main grid, and were rectified immediately by the staff, some of the other areas highlighted in your review were not brought to our attention. Also not stated is that we tried multiple times to offer you a complementary upgrade into a most luxurious villas in the premises, to solve most of your complaints regarding the room that you have booked , which you declined. Instead we are quite surprised that you decided to post photos after you completed your full 6 nights at Aarunya, after demanding a full refund and settling for a complementary stay. What's also not mentioned in your review is that in spite of offering to assist your endless demands with transferring you to another hotel, you declined that offer as well. In spite of the staff doing everything within their power to ensure your stay was beyond exceptional, sadly it was clear beyond a certain point that there was nothing anyone could do to make your stay better, and your comments on the review do not acknowledge the efforts taken. We have nonetheless addressed the outstanding points highlighted by you, while maintaining that your comment on rates being higher than the Maldives is subjective. 
We thank you forthe kind feedback on the views, hopefully you took some pictures and would like to share it with us, as 99% of our online image and review content is guest generated, together with wonderful memories of their stays with us.  
 
We remain committed to offering the highest levels of service to all guests in the future, and we are sorry we did not meet your expectations this time.

More than once we had food with a maintenance guy around us trying to fix things that would constantly break down. Staff are really untrained.

The manager left on his weekend off on our arrival and no one in the hotel was able to make a decision to make things better. We was fully unavailable.

The price was higher than going to the Maldives, we asked for a refund of 50% and it was given to us by the Manager when he finally got back. The price does not match the experience at all. 

The hotel is definitely not what it looks like in the professional pictures they have. 

The views are incredible and the Ayurvedic treatments are nice, but we left the hotel more stressed that when we arrived.

Every negative guest review is carefully examined and investigated, to ensure an unbiased and transparent response that is fair to both parties.

At the time of check in we were requested to settle payment in full which we did and were subsequently taken to the two Sky Tents we had booked for two nights. The Sky Tents were exquisite and the view from them was extremely pictureous.
 
However the service being offered by the staff was extremely lukewarm and unfriendly except for just one single individual, Indu. 

When requesting a buggy for my pregnant daughter in law to be taken down a 45 degree slope to her Sky Tent, we were informed they were not authorized to do so by the “Management”. Also despite charging Triple rates for one of the Sky Tents, the coffee making facility was available only for double occupancy which remain that way up to the time of checkout. 
 
The set menus on offer were mediocre and the portions served inadequate. The complimentary nightly room turndown on offer was done only on one night and the GM did not meet us in person even though we were aware he was on the property on the day we booked in.

Its not a property we would visit again.

Thank you for your review. I was away from the hotel last evening but was aware of the prevailing issues concerning your booking and stay while it was happening. 

As you are aware, we are a nature resort which you booked knowingly. Our energy conservation efforts were clearly explained to you during your room introduction including all available alternates to ensure your stay was comfortable. We are not in the habit of running electricity for hours to heat a jacuzzi not in use as it goes against our business principals. Unfortunately a 600 liter Jacuzzi does not heat up in minutes and we would have appreciated your understanding in this regards. The pouring of hot water into the Jacuzzi is not a standard of the hotel, rather the effort of the staff to fix a problem they felt needed fixing based on your demands. 

In regards to your requested refund, you have failed to mention that we offered to first upgrade you to our highest category villa. You refused. We then offered to relocate you to another villa that was awaiting arrival of another guest, you refused that too. You have also failed to mention that you gladly accepted the complementary dinner that was extended and not charged. We hope that you take the time to read the reviews of our past guests which clearly indicate that we go to great measures and practice extraordinary standards of service in ensuring our guests a pleasant stay. I am sorry to note that you felt different. For these reasons only a refund partial or otherwise was refused because it was clear you were only interested in getting your money back, rather than enjoying your night at Aarunya as per the free upgrade on offer or the opportunity of staying in an equal category villa.

Staff said the water will be ready in half an hour. But after dinner and two more hours waiting, the water is still cold.  

The staff said they only need ten more minutes to fix it otherwise they can add hot water in the tank manually.  After several barrels of hot water poured, the jaccuzi is still cold as there is just to much cold water!

I asked for a refund with the amount of price difference between room with jaccuzi and room without jaccuzi. Hotel told me there is nothing they can do about it. So we ended up spending whole night fixing the jacuzzi with

Friendly staff. Wonderful View

Negative:

Certainly not a resort, just a group of villas with no Spa nor a Gym. I am not sure how it can be called a resort, it is more of a group of villas... Only small lobby, and only few staff members (maybe 5) that were doing all the job; for example, the person who helped us with our luggage during check-in (who was by the way very polite and friendly) was the same one who made our omelet the next morning

Spa ! well if you can call a five adjacent small rooms that are open all day for animals and different type of insects to roam around a Spa, then yes it is a spa. The spa is basically few small rooms, has no lounge, no resting area,and no facilities. Moreover, This luxurious resort’s spa, has no full time staff at the spa, so you have to give them a notice before so they can call someone from outside to do the massage for you !

The Gym is basically a very (very) small room, has no proper lighting, and bunch of equipments were put there. The way to the gym is dirty and dark. They used the space around the gym entrance as a storage area, so you can imagine the type of insect/animals you’ll encounter trying to reach the gym. 

Electricity frequently cuts off

AC is not working properly

🔹 Location & View:
The only highlight of our stay was the stunning view of the Galle Fort. The hotel’s location is excellent close to the Galle fort with beautiful scenery.

🔹 Room Issues:
The room allocated to us was not in good condition. The main door lock was faulty, and although a technician was sent to fix it after i made a request to rectify, it took about 45 minutes, disturbing our privacy and taking away from our short one day stay.
Additionally, the balcony door wouldn’t close properly and remained unfixed during our stay creating a serious security and comfort concern.

🔹 In-room Amenities:
Despite our booking being for 2 people on FB basis, the room was only arranged and stocked for one person, only one bottle of water, single sets of tea/coffee, shampoo, body wash and etc. I had to repeatedly call, request and remind staff to provide necessities what we required for 2 people.

To make matters worse, one of the towels provided was damaged, which was shocking and unacceptable from a hotel claiming to be 5-star. (Photo attached)

🔹 Dining Experience:
The dinner buffet had very limited variety and the food quality was poor. The breakfast buffet was even worse. Certain items like sausages and eggs were hidden and not freely offered unless specifically requested. We asked for two cheese omelets, but after waiting for nearly 30 minutes, we received only one, and it didn’t even have cheese.

🔹 Checkout Experience:
Our checkout was scheduled at 12 PM, but since lunch was only served from 1:30 PM, we requested a late checkout, which was denied. We were left waiting outside until lunch started.
Adding insult to injury, instead of a buffet lunch (which was part of the FB plan), we were given an à la carte menu, as the hotel claimed low occupancy. During this time, staff behavior was unwelcoming. they looked at us as if we were loitering, which made us feel very uncomfortable and disrespected.

🔹 Overall Summary:

- Poor room condition and maintenance
- Insufficient in room amenities for a double occupancy
- Damaged towel provided. This is totally unacceptable and disappointed (Photo attached)
- Low quality food and lack of verities in buffet offerings
- Poor service and unacceptable attitude by some staff when we were waiting for the lunch despite FB booking
- No flexibility with check-out (Even we booked FB basis)

Our stay at Le Grand Hotel, Galle was extremely disappointing and not worth the premium pricing and the 5-star rating. We would not recommend this hotel, especially if you’re expecting comfort, proper service, or value for money.","Extremely Disappointing Stay at Le - Grand Hotel, Galle, Sri Lanka– Not Worth the 5-Star Rating","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r1007794454-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

First impressions count and the check-in was just about okay. The view from reception across to Galle Fort is fantastic, but that really was the high point of our stay.

They then showed us to our room. The sunbed cushions on the patio were completely saturated and there were no sunbed towels in the room. 2 small bottles of complimentary water - just enough to make a pot of tea. They did replace the cushions, provided some sunbed towels and give us extra water, but it really shouldn’t be down to us to point out 2 basic issues with a room - where was the management oversight?

We stayed 3 nights and didn’t get a proper evening turn down service once. First night nothing, second night he caught us in the room so gave us some towels and water, third night they didn’t get as far as the bathroom. 

Staff seemed to be relatively disinterested in customer satisfaction- it was noticeable that nobody wore name badges, unlike just about every other hotel we visited in Sri Lanka. Nobody wished us a happy day, staff seemed to avoid eye contact and smiles were generally not visible- again very different to all the other hotels we stayed in.

The food at breakfast was poor - both in quality and in choice. Because of this we didn’t eat any other meals there, as Galle fort has an abundance of good restaurant options.

The last night we were just about to get into bed and water started pouring into the room from a ceiling light fitting. I called reception and they said they would get someone to come and deal with it. After half an hour waiting I called up to see what was happening- the receptionist had no idea, and didn’t seem to care.

We encountered a minor hiccup with the hot water showers in both rooms and we informed the management and we expected the issue to be resolved. Right when we were about to leave, the manager of the hotel came to talk to us regarding our experience and offered her apologies for the problem we encountered. During her apology however, she asked us if we knew how to operate a tap and proceeded to explain the hot/ cold function of a shower. We were deeply offended by her comment and she treated us as if we didn’t know how to operate a shower. While we had a subpar experience at Le Grand, her snarky comments about this ruined the whole experience for us and left us leaving with a sour attitude towards the staff and the hotel. 

Rather than troubling the guests with something so minor, the management should talk to their staff and get the matter sorted. 

Further, the checkout time was 12pm but the lunch buffet starts at 1pm. This left us just sitting in the restaurant for an hour. If we were informed of this sooner, we could have allocated our time efficiently, considering my father was in a rush to return to Colombo for a meeting. 

While the view from the hotel is amazing, I can firmly say that we will not be returning to this hotel ever again. 

The food selection was not the best and it is not very vegetarian friendly. My daughter is a vegetarian and she did not have many selections. 

I first left a 4 star review but with the manager’s attitude and the delay of the lunch buffet, I felt the need to share our experience.","Terrible","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r990576029-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

","Value","2","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","2","Service","2","Sleep Quality","3","I’ll begin this review by saying that the hotel itself is beautiful. It’s extremely picturesque and the swimming pool and bar area is a wonderful spot to sink a few pina coladas and watch the sun disappear. The staff are also wonderfully friendly. However, sadly, my experience at Le Grand Galle did not meet my expectations of a hotel of this calibre and cost. There was a significant shortfall in service accompanied with significant cleanliness and food handling safety issues.  

After a two-night stay in November ‘24 I checked out of Le Grand Galle with my partner. Upon check-out, we shared some feedback with the staff regarding our stay - feedback we have subsequently sent in writing to the management team. 

Below are the issues we experienced throughout our stay: 
 ⁃ When we arrived, the hot water was not working in the room. We called a technician to attend. The water only then got hot after running the tap or shower for 8-10 minutes for the duration of our stay. At a luxury hotel hot water should work immediately. 
 ⁃ Power points were not working in the room. We called a technician to attend once again. He was able to get some of the points working, but not all. The USB port (the plug we needed the most) did not work at all during our stay. Again, at a luxury establishment, this should work or be checked before guests check-in.  
 ⁃ There was a leaking pipe underneath the bathroom sink, causing water to spill onto the floor
 ⁃ The back of the toilet and shower doors were filthy. They were covered in dirt and streaks. They looked like they had not been washed in some time. There was also some sort of white product smeared on one. We sent the pictures to the staff at the reception desk upon checkout but no immediate action was taken.   
 ⁃ Food. Wow. Just awful. We ate dinner at the ‘Blue’ seafood restaurant on our first evening. The appetisers we ordered were average at best. One of the mains ordered (Mahi Mahi) was served so overcooked it was almost like rubber. It also was served very differently to the menu description. The menu said it came with “ginger and cardamon sauce and noodles.” It was served with ‘Tomato Pronto’, pasta with garlic and oil. We asked the staff at the time what was in the dish because it was different to what we expected. They explained but no remedy to the inedible food or the change in dish was offered by staff or the head chef. 
 ⁃ At breakfast on the first morning, we spotted a staff member coughing quite violently into his hands and then immediately touching the buffet foods and serving utensils. A very clear lack of health and safety considerations.
 ⁃ The treadmills in the gymnasium did not work. Again, why these aren’t working in a hotel of this kind, was alarming. 

My partner and I shared the above as we departed, but received no remedy from staff members at the time, which again, given the price point of the hotel, we were disappointed with. 

We have subsequently contacted the hotel and fed back appropriately. However, after offering us an arbitrary $100 USD discount on our stay and, when we indicated this did not feel appropriate, has now gone silent and refused to respond to our correspondence. 

We stayed in some wonderful hotels while in Sri Lanka, but the sour taste left in our mouths by Le Grand Galle means we feel obligated to make sure no one else receives such a poor experience. It’s not a cheap hotel and when paying a premium price, I expect a premium experience. 

I’ve included some pictures for reference.","Enormously disappointing. Save your money.","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r985438363-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The architecture and design is spectacular and matches the views properly.
However, we had a pretty wierd experience in a hotel we never expected: NO! We simply asked for a to-go pack at the breakfast as we were leaving early for a safari tour, and the we recieved a flimsy small paper box. We asked for a second one( as it torn apart just in the restaurant) and the lady simply said NO and left our table.We believe that No scenery could change the impact of such attitude.
Breakfast buffet was simple and small comparing to other hotels in Sri lanka.Coffee was awful, tea was old, no pure fruit juice but some salty or sour mixtures not appropriate for a kid or even many grownups.  Also we had a dinner at the restuarant including a milanese schnitzel(emphasized to be without any spices as we ordered it for our child) and a green salad. The menu said the salad would contain avocado which was not. The chicken was seeved with a mashed potatos and a dressing that tasted just like other food in here: spicy. Our kid did eat a piece, and unfortunately it was just average and I did not like it either. Conclusion: no food here satisfies.
 Morover, We bought some fruit for our 4 year old kid the other night, and when we asked for a knife, there was just another NO! The reception guy informed us that we can ask the restuarant to peel it off for us, which they did, but the habit of rejecting requests seems to be a habit .
There are some nice staff in the hotel but many others seem disinterested in their job or they are not willing to help. The reception guys were helpful, the cleanliness is perfect, and the swimming pool is a true pleasure,But it is one of my least favorite places I have ever stayed in.","Very beautiful hotel with poor services","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r943835337-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

To make matters worse, they never even let me know. Booking.com had told me of the cancellation and when I called up the hotel to ask why they eventually told me it was due to a failed card payment. Which wouldn’t make sense as I had used the same card for my other 7 hotels whilst in Sri Lanka. I also checked with my bank and they had no failed payment attempts which makes me think the hotel is lying. When I asked to rebook the room apparently had already sold out with a few hours of cancellation - which I think suggests a double booking! 

I am sure hotel is lovely but unfortunately I’d strongly recommend booking at the many other very nice hotels in galle as they are too unreliable and caused me a lot of stress on my holiday.","Booking cancelled a few days before with no explanation - avoid","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r938373588-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

However, a notable drawback of this otherwise beautiful property is the quality of its restaurant service and food. 
- We ordered food at the pool bar which took over 45 mins to arrive, and the quality of the food was average
- Restaurant staff doesn't seem to process any information, just nods their heads for anything
- Worst breakfast buffet I've been to in a while, mainly consisted of action tables (for eggs, waffles/pancakes) and these were made to order. When we placed an order, we were told it would be send to the table. It never came. When we went and inquired we were told ""we are a busy"". Even my coffee took more than 20 mins to arrive. The entire buffet service was very unorganised, with the staff running around like headless chicken.

About 30 minutes later, we were informed that the room was ready, though we were cautioned the floors had just been cleaned and would dry in five minutes. Since it was lunchtime, we decided to head to the restaurant first and returned to the room about 20 minutes later.

Within minutes of entering, my wife slipped in the bathroom due to a pool of water left on the floor, which had clearly not been dried properly. She sustained a painful sprain and a deep cut on her arm, requiring medical attention. The injury disrupted our plans for the remainder of our stay.

What made matters worse was the hotel’s lack of urgency or compassion. When she called guest services to report the incident, the executive was dismissive and abruptly ended the call. We had to escalate the matter ourselves, eventually speaking with the General Manager, Mr. Sibi Matthew. Instead of acknowledging the seriousness of the lapse, he attempted to offer inducements — which felt inappropriate — rather than expressing genuine concern or accountability.

We’ve always associated the Taj brand with high standards of care and hospitality, having stayed with them for over 25 years. Unfortunately, our experience at Taj Bentota fell well short. The poor housekeeping, lack of supervision, and unprofessional handling of a safety incident have cost us two out of three days of what should have been a relaxing holiday.

I would urge future guests to exercise serious caution. We expected better — especially from a brand like Taj.","Serious Safety Incident and Disappointing Staff Response at Taj Bentota","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012536795-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

A loyal Taj customer and a shareholder I was expecting a pleasant experience, as I usually have experienced.

As the room was not ready, we waited for over 45 minutes after which we were told that the room was ready but the bathroom was wet and would dry up in 5 minutes.

However since our toddler was hungry, we did not head to the room instead it to the restaurant. After a quick light meal that took about 20 minutes, we headed back to the room and my wife visited the toilet.

Instead of experiencing a dry floor, they was stagnant water on which my wife slipped and had a long cut on her arm. 

Guest services was dismissive about about this, no regret, and rather the lady abruptly disconnected the call.

We were offered a visit to the doctor and a first aid kit, however, the first aid kit did not have a disinfectant which is necessary for cleaning up such a wound or a cut.

After a while, the general manager, Siby Matthew came to meet us, wanting us to calm down, offering to make up for the horrendous experience. We were enticed with better service room, upgrades, blah blah blah.

It smacked of insincerity and a lack of ownership. This was absolutely criminally negligent to let a guest check in when the room is not in a position to accept visitors and to top it all the attitude of guest services to bang the phone and not having a well stocked first aid kit.

Upon arrival, we were able to check in early at 12 PM instead of the standard 3 PM, which was a pleasant surprise.

Rooms and Facilities
The room is very nice and recently renovated. It’s located on the ground floor, which is fine—this is what we paid for, including a garden view. Unfortunately, there's no direct access from the terrace to the garden or beach, which is a pity. The hotel itself looks good, though parts of the garden seem a bit neglected.

Beach and Pool
There’s a nice, clean beach in front of the hotel. However, there are no hotel sunbeds on the beach—only in the garden, and even there, not enough. The same goes for the pool area, where sun umbrellas are limited.

Dining – All Inclusive? Not Really.
We paid extra for the all-inclusive option, which was significantly more expensive than half or full board. Despite checking in at 12 PM, we didn’t receive our wristbands until 3 PM—which is quite unusual. Typically, it's the other way around.

Meals are only available buffet-style in the main restaurant for breakfast and lunch. It’s a shame, as the à la carte menu looks quite appealing. Dinner is possible at two other à la carte restaurants, but without options like king prawns or lobster, which is disappointing.

Surprisingly, there’s only one bar in the hotel, located at the reception. There’s no actual pool bar—only a waiter who brings drinks from the restaurant. After waiting 1.5 hours for a menu (and asking three times), we received it, but no one ever came back to take our order. I genuinely don’t understand how this system works. What the hotel calls a “pool bar” simply doesn’t exist.

The Shack, another venue, is only open for dinner, so it doesn’t offer any daytime seating either. During the day, there are no snacks available under the all-inclusive package. We normally skip lunch and prefer to grab a light snack later on, but don’t expect that here.

The drink selection is also extremely limited. Despite a huge number of cocktails listed on the menu—both alcoholic and non-alcoholic—only four non-alcoholic cocktails are included in the all-inclusive plan. Really? At a 5-star hotel? No milkshakes, no smoothies... This is worse than a €300-per-week hotel in Egypt. Why not just set a price limit per drink within the all-inclusive package? The current system makes no sense.

Final Thoughts
The hotel is in a stunning location with breathtaking surroundings. However, the all-inclusive experience is comparable to a 3-star hotel at best. The number of places where you can actually use the all-inclusive benefits is practically zero.

We came here to relax after a demanding work season and chose this hotel carefully, but unfortunately, it’s far below our expectations. Next time, we’ll definitely return to Anantara or Heritance.","All inclusive? NOP! Save your money and go to Heritance or Anantara.","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1002893200-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

If you visit this hotel as a three star, you will be happy but if you think you are going to a 5 star hotel please avoid this hotel completely. 
Of the hotels it had the worst service, worst cleanliness, worst food and worst rooms. It needs a complete overhaul to qualify as a luxury hotel.

However, my stay was far from what I’ve come to expect from the Taj brand. For families with kids, this property severely underdelivers. Unlike smaller Taj properties in India, there’s no dedicated kids’ playroom or activities. I specifically chose Taj over Cinnamon (which boasts an excellent kids’ room and family-friendly facilities), and I regret that decision deeply.

---

Stay Review
After completing my stay, my disappointment only deepened. To fellow travelers, especially Indians familiar with the warm hospitality and meticulous service of Taj India properties: do not expect the same standard here.

The service quality was subpar at best. The staff lacked courtesy and attention to detail. An instance that stands out is an unpleasant encounter with in-room dining staff, who slammed the door upon leaving, all because I requested plates and cutlery. Such behavior is unacceptable and left a bitter impression.

Food and Beverage Experience
The F&B service was frustratingly slow and disorganized. A poolside pizza order took over 35 minutes, a delay that tarnished what should’ve been a relaxed experience. Despite explicitly asking for two glasses of milk in the morning, only one was delivered. As a parent, I was particularly dissatisfied with the khichdi prepared for my children – it was bland, completely unsalted, and lacked any effort to adjust to preferences, with the justification that kids eat it without salt.

---

Facilities and Maintenance
The property’s condition also leaves much to be desired. The washroom design is outdated and impractical, requiring guests to stand in a tiny bathtub to take a shower – far below the standards for a luxury stay. Lobby furniture is visibly worn out, with torn upholstery and a dated look that doesn't reflect the premium price tag of INR 25,000 per night.","A Disappointing Experience with Taj Sri Lanka","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r989343401-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

They have big fanfare when you arrive but then there was a complication with our booking and we had to wait over an hour for our rooms,  the reception staff were very formal and didn’t really explain what was happening. The rooms were very dated with flaky paintwork, dirt under the bed, sticky handles and a cracked sink in the bathroom. The staff moved us to some more recently ‘renovated’ rooms which were much better, although we still found the bathroom sink a bit dirty and cupboard handles in particular were sticky with greasy marks. The cleaner did wipe them but they were still bad and we used a tissue to open them. To be fair there just wasn’t enough cleaning staff and often our rooms weren’t cleaned till teatime because there was only two people doing them all.

Then on the second day, our room was flooded after it rained in the night. Again the reception staff were a bit abrupt and we waited a long time sitting around before someone came to help us. At this point I did contact TF. However, the manager did come at this point and apologised and moved us (again) to an upgraded room. 

At this point the rooms were fine with lovely views of the sea but the whole experience wasn’t pleasant and it unsettled the kids which is the only reason I didn’t move hotels altogether. Individual staff members were really friendly and helpful, particularly in the restaurant but we just didn’t find the standard of food and hygiene as high as other hotels we’d been to on same star rating. For example the canopy over the restaurant was flaking and mouldy. Again I think staffing was an issue as in the bar we waited a long time for food/drinks and were told that there was only two guys covering the whole hotel. It’s a very large hotel and in general it felt it lacked adequate staffing and investment.","Disappointing, very dated and under staffed.","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r960653212-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Ayubowan!

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. First and foremost, on behalf of the entire team at 98 Acres Resort & Spa, please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience and distress you experienced during your recent stay.

We deeply regret that we fell short of your expectations, especially on such an important occasion as your wife’s birthday. We understand that what was meant to be a memorable celebration turned into a stressful experience, and we are truly sorry for the discomfort caused.

While our resort is located within a natural setting surrounded by lush greenery and wildlife, we acknowledge that guests should never feel unsettled or uncomfortable in their rooms. Our team’s response should have been faster and more empathetic in resolving the issue to your satisfaction. Please rest assured that we are reviewing this incident carefully with all relevant departments to ensure such lapses do not occur again.

We are grateful for your honest review, as it helps us reflect and improve the quality of service we offer, especially for guests marking special occasions. Although we were able to partially address the matter at the time with a refund, we understand that the overall experience did not meet your expectations, and for that, we remain truly apologetic.

We hope you may consider giving us a second opportunity in the future to provide you with the genuine hospitality and peace of mind that 98 Acres is known for.

I paid over $400 in total (USD), including $327 for the room and 28,000 LKR for a special anniversary setup. Sadly, the stay was a major disappointment.

The first room had insects on the bed and a large gecko inside the wall. When I reported this, instead of relocating us promptly, two staff members showed up with a cloth and gecko spray. I insisted on changing rooms and was finally moved—but the second room also had a large gecko clearly visible as soon as we walked in. All of this happened after midnight, completely ruining our celebration.

The staff offered a $100 refund, which I accepted because I was exhausted and had no choice. However, for a hotel of this category and price, this is simply unacceptable.

The views are beautiful, yes.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback with us. I am very sorry to hear that your experience at 98 Acres was affected by the repeated offers and the checkout situation you described.

The view from our villa, and especially from reception, is spectacular.

When we checked into the hotel, there was a lovely Hindu welcome ceremony.

The villa itself was quite comfortable but I would not say that it was luxurious.  Even though 98 Acres Resort is set in a fairly remote region, our villa had no problem with hot water or the shower’s water pressure.  Breakfast was good with ample offerings.

However, despite all of the above, our stay at 98 Acres resort was ruined by the pushy, hard-sell, we were confronted with almost immediately upon check-in.  This pushy service actually began at check-in when they immediately requested to know whether my family of four as well as the other family of four we were travelling with wanted to book a Sri Lankan dinner for US$ 40 per person.  I had politely said we had not made up our mind yet and thought that was the end of it.

As our room was not yet ready, my family decided to have some lunch at the restaurant.  The other family who we were travelling with only opted to have drinks and sat separate and apart from us.  Immediately upon sitting down for lunch, one of the wait staff asked us whether we planned to have the Sri Lankan dinner at the restaurant that evening.  Again, I politely said that we did not know yet, and in any case, needed to discuss our dinner plans with our friends.  Again, I thought this would be the end of it.  However, during our lunch, I was asked 8 additional times whether my family intended to have the Sri Lanka dinner at the restaurant that evening.  Each time, I repeated that I needed to discuss such with my friends but they kept asking me the same question over and over again and again.  So much so that it ruined our lunch.

While we were enduring this continuous hard sell, our friends endured the same harassment while they were having drinks.  Our friends were asked at least four, and maybe five times, whether they intended to have the Sri Lankan dinner at the restaurant that evening.  In the end, we opted to go into Ella for dinner and had a lovely meal at Chill Cafe.

I figured that would be the end of the story.  However, the next morning at breakfast, the same story repeated itself and several of the wait staff badgered me repeatedly continously asking me whether my family planned to have the Sri Lankan dinner at the restaurant that evening.

The final nail in the coffin occurred at checkout.  The only charge that I had to settle was for a bottle of water that I had at breakfast the day before (the hotel costs had already been paid in full via booking.com).  I therefore assumed that it would be a very quick checkout.  However, they told me that a hand towel was missing from the room and this Kafkaesque episode went on for nearly ten minutes.  So much so, that it left a terrible taste in my mouth.  My friends were confronted by the same situation.

For a hotel that holds itself out to be a five-star property, the hotel completely lacked customer service.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. I'm truly sorry to hear that you felt disappointed with your recent experience at our resort.

Please allow me to clarify that we would never take payment twice for the one-time service. If I recall correctly, you made your reservation and payment through a foreign bank.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. I'm truly sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations and that you encountered so many issues during your visit.

I sincerely apologize for the discomfort and inconvenience you experienced, from the lack of air conditioning and noise disturbances to the situation in the restaurant. Your experience is certainly not what we strive to provide our guests, and I deeply regret that we fell short in so many areas.

As an eco-friendly resort located in an area with generally comfortable weather, we have not installed air conditioning in our rooms. However, due to global warming, we recognize that the daytime temperatures can be warmer than expected. We are seriously considering installing air conditioning in all our rooms to enhance our guests' comfort.

We are also sorry to hear that you were disturbed by the music from the Ravana Pool Club, which is located on the other side of the mountain which is operating only during the daytime. 
We will definitely look into ways to reduce the noise in our rooms to ensure a more peaceful and relaxing stay.

Please know that your comments have been taken seriously, and we will be addressing each of these concerns with the appropriate teams to ensure improvements are made.

If there is anything further you would like to discuss, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at fom@resort98acres.com. I appreciate your feedback and hope that we can regain your trust in the future.

There are so many reasons, I will need to use dot points!
- there is no air conditioning and no fly-screens, only a fan. It gets HOT in Ella, so we were grossly uncomfortable the entire stay (it is in the hills, so bugs everywhere)
- the rooms are NOISEY! There is a HORRENDOUS club within a few minutes walk of the property, and you can hear the thud-thud of music all day and into the night. It is truly awful. When we arrived (after many emails requesting a quiet room), we were placed in a downstairs room with a group in the room above us. The rooms have timber floors so the scraping of furniture and walking was incessant. There were also builders directly under our balcony, using a circular saw, so all the dust came up in to our room. After MUCH discussion, we were finally allowed to move into a different area of the property. While you couldn't hear the horrible music from the club, it still wasn't near to being peaceful and relaxing. 
- the tv is in a small little area off to the side. The fan does not reach there and the sofa is very hard. A gecko lived in the ceiling, so we got pooped on twice! You cannot see the TV from the bed. 
- there is a very busy road going right through the property. There are people and tuk-tuks travelling along it at all hours.
- the majority of the rooms are all on top of each other - there are 4 rooms to a double storey building with wooden floors, so the noise is awful.
- but, one of the main reasons we would never step foot in this place again is the owner and his son and daughter-in-law. We went for dinner in the restaurant and the owner and family were also dining there. They waltzed in with their young daughter - maybe 4 years old, and two nanny's. While the owner, son and daughter-in-law sat down to eat, the nanny's and little girl were left without food or drink in the lounge area. The parents quite literally had their backs to her! The little girl created havoc in the restaurant and was being chased everywhere by the nanny - it was after 8pm, so the poor little girl should have been in bed. The parents ignored her, and every time she tried to go near them, they turned her around and called the nanny to come and get her! The entire dining room was disgusted! The mother was too busy trying to be gorgeous, and the father was on the phone half the time. 
- The owner obviously went for style (although there wasn't much) over substance, because the entire place was extremely impractical and uncomfortable. They obviously don't care about the experience of their guests, only the money they bring in.....thus building a loud, tacky club right next door!","NOT relaxing, NOT luxury, don't waste your money!","2024-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r965811371-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to review us on TripAdvisor.

We have carefully noted your comments and sincerely apologize for any
shortcomings that led to us not exceeding your expectations.

At our resort, we continually strive to provide the best service and
facilities to our guests. Currently, we are undergoing construction to
upgrade the resort and create a better environment for our guests.
However, we have implemented measures to conduct construction
activities only from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM to minimize any disturbance to
our guests.

We are also scheduled to temporarily close the hotel to complete all
pending constructions. Additionally, we are planning to create a buggy
car pathway to the restaurant and other areas to assist guests with
walking difficulties.

Moreover, we have recently encountered challenges with the roadway
leading to our Premium Deluxe rooms, Spa, and Executive Suite rooms.
This roadway was commonly used by the public to reach the small Adam's
Peak as an alternative pathway to the actual one. Due to the ease of
access and free parking available at our main car park near the main
road, all tourist vehicles visiting the small Adam's Peak were
utilizing our facilities. Despite the high tourist arrival during this
season, we did not object to their use of our roadway. However, to
address this issue and ensure the safety of our in-house clients, as
well as to provide swift transportation service between our upper and
lower area rooms, we have already constructed a private roadway.

Regarding dining options, we offer a buffet for breakfast and
personalized service for lunch and dinner from a set menu. Our set
menu includes a comprehensive selection of choices, and we also offer
an à la carte menu.

We must respectfully deny your comment about our staff asking for tips
for services. This claim has been refuted by past guest comments on
the same platform over the last ten years.

We understand that you have raised certain concerns based on
assumptions that may not accurately reflect the reality of our
operations.

Nevertheless, we would like to extend a warm invitation for you to
visit us again. We are committed to ensuring a better experience for
you during your next stay.

Do not book this hotel if you want peace and quiet.  

Do not book this hotel until you are certain they have fixed the roads and paths and have completed their noisy expansion project.  However, whether they will then have a large enough restaurant or pool will remain to be seen.   Currently you have to use what is effectively a public roadway with no lighting to get between many rooms and all the rest of the hotel facilities.  

We had such high hopes of this hotel.  We had friends who had stayed here previously and had said it was the best place they stayed during their Sri Lanka tour.

If the hotel is going to stay open while the property is a building site, they need to give discounts  AND warn guests.  It's greedy of the owners and makes for a very unpleasant stay for guests to have to dodge tuktuks and speeding motorbikes to go up and down a steep slope to reach the dining room, the pool, the reception area and anything else.  When you complain, all you get is a shrug.

The place is very noisy all day long.  Not just owing to the construction work.  Just over the brow of a low hill is the Ravanna Pool Club, a honeypot it seems for the large numbers of younger visitors to Ella who are willing to pay a day fee to use the pool area which has loud, booming disco music you can here from the decks of the rooms.  To enjoy the views or relax on your deck, you have to endure the vibrations.    Also, the property is far from private.  The awful, rutted road that runs through it is busy day and night because it's the access to those hiking Little Adams Peak and all those heading to and from the noisy pool area.  Just for clarity, do note that hotel guests do have the use of a separate small pool - but that involves a long walk and steps from many rooms.

There is no way to access the dining room, the pool area and their shared toilet facilities without using big, uneven stone steps.  Nor most rooms.  The buggies that offer lifts only take you along paths or roads.  If it rains, expect to get wet as you cannot get from door do door.

As this is a small hotel, meals are served to your table, there is no buffet at dinner, and just a few items at breakfast.  Allow plenty of time for your meals.  Owing to the fact that the majority of guests are from overseas, the dinner menu had mostly European choices and the breakfast was very 'western'.  As authentic Sri Lankan food is delicious, this is a shame.    

This is another hotel where tipping staff is the only way to get any service.  Owing to how our plans worked when we checked in, our luggage at the reception area as we had to go for a much delayed appointment, Having arrived to Ella on the always late train from Kandy, after checking in, we had to dash for a late booking elsewhere.  When we returned to reception we were told our luggage had been put in our room which sounded helpful.  However, it did mean we did not tip the porters/buggy drivers.  Despite phoning for buggy service to reach dinner as we did not wish to walk along the busy and unlit public roadway, no buggy arrived so after 25 minutes we had to walk.  When we wanted to check out, nobody came to help with the luggage.  When we walked up to the reception area to ask for help after the phone request failed, we were told we had not tipped the staff so they were not minded to help us.  Shocking!

Clearly many guests do not have our expectation as it seems the magical views enabled them to overlook so much else that was disappointing.","Do you homework before you book!","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r941536277-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The hotel, after spending three nights in a pool villa, was completely underwhelming. Sure, a beautiful spot. But they seem far more interested in turning it into an Instagram Vegas spot than preserving what was, yes, WAS, once a pristine region.

Expect lots of construction. Expect non-stop parades of people walking through the hotel to walk up to Little Ella. Expect craziness and noise coming from an absurd Day resort next door (owned by the hotel) with giant Instagram swings, silly Zip lines, and a huge Vegas style pool with DJ's and bars. 

Expect nothing in the way of authenticity. This area is ruined and 98 Acres is as much responsible for it than anyone.

While I loved the rest of Sri Lanka and found it authentic and joyful, this area, and as a result the hotel, is truly sad. Avoid the entire area. Go elsewhere. Run.

The location superb for access to Ella without being in the centre of the hustle and bustle. 
Cement mixers and building noise aside we enjoyed a 3 night stop enjoying what the area had to offer. The accommodation was lovely, a shower with a view!  We enjoyed the food, service was acceptable (if a little slow). Honestly I came away sad… just because it has potential and I hope in time 98 Acres achieve their potential. My advice to the hotel is to close… finish your hotel and then invite people to stay. Don’t trick them into paying for a relaxed stay, because it is not what you are currently offering. Thank you however for refunding us for the nights we didn’t stay as we chose to move on a little sooner than originally intended.

That's it.

Disliked · Well First is this place is way over priced. way too much. The value for the money i paid i could have stayed extra day in Shangri-La.
Second is there was way to much insects and bugs in the room. when we checked in it was nice and clean. But after the sun went down and got dark there was insects and bugs falling through the room. And there was a lizard that was bigger than the palm size. the bed had the mosquito net, we even put that net down and insects and bugs were still coming through and our toddler was really uncomfy and could not sleep at all and we couldn't either as we had to keep taking the insects out from the blanket and bed. It was really uncomfy stay and sleep.
Third was dinner, we went to dinner about 7.30pm and it was only us and 1 more guest table that was there at that time, so we ordered a hot dog and French fires for the little one so he can eat and we ordered few drinks as well, his food and the drinks took about 25minz to arrive even though there was no one in the restaurant. and once it came we ordered our food. Well lets just say we could have gone ate from out side and came back. it took more than 45minz to arrive and we ordered Beef fried rice and pork fried rice, once they bought it they were like so its 2 chicken fired rice, and we were like no we ordered this. and he is like are you sure? And we were like yes, and then he asked us if we can taste and see if its actually chicken or not. so we did and we said it is chicken but its okay as we not going to stay another 45minz for the food to come. very bad service and the food quality was not good at all also.
Forth was when we were checking out, because i made the booking through booking.com i selected the option to pay at property. and because of that i did the currency exchange and kept in local currency to pay. But the hotel insisted that I pay in USD and not local currency even though I did not have USD, so they took the local currency and exchange to the USD with the rate that hotel was giving and paid it.  This was really bad and this is why we will never stay here again.

The view and the rooms are amazing and are well maintained. In addition most of the staff is very friendly and accommodating. However, we gave 1 star given that the value for money is a joke. We have stayed in luxury hotels around the world (comparable ones for a price tag of 200€+) and this one has been by far the worst. First, the pool area is way too small and is rather underwhelming - when you then think about the fact that they newly built the pool club you could say we can go there however even as a hotel guest you would have to pay (which is a joke given 200€+ rate for one night). When asking about this front desk was not really accommodating as I have the feeling that they don’t care. Also, there is no AC which is quite something for this price. Besides, you need to be aware that everyone who wants to go to little adams peak and to the pool club all go THROUGH the hotel (so lot of external people and loud tuk tuks). Personally, I think this is a way too touristy spot and you rather go here for a drink at the bar to enjoy the view instead of spending insanely (for Sri Lankan standards) amount of money. As I said I took the time to write detailed review and hope you find it hopeful by choosing a stay in Ella. Again the rooms and staff is nice but well not worth the money you pay for this (and the 4.6 rating on Google as of now I can only explain by external guests review who just come for the view). Wish you great stay in Ella (please see photo attached how 98 acres is advertised to external customers so you can imagine how busy it might get and that a lot of the privacy nature feeling gets lost)","Rooms are amazing but surely the resort is not at all worth the money you pay for (pictures online may be misleading)","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r912756640-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The hotel is 3* at best
Gave us wrong rooms and bed linen was dirty. Tried to insist on taking you around by golf buggies even when only 40 yards to the room and begging for tips
Sockets couldn't be used with adaptors, chain for blind dangerous in the middle of the door, bed away from the wall so couldn't get to the bed side light, bathroom windows left open, big enough to climb in plus bugs in room. Mossy net for a doublebed no good for King size, small bottle of water, no nice extras with turn down service which was at 18:30 when showering. Shampoo etc in lovely little pot jugs but hard to get any out and impossible to read which was which in the poor lighting Swimming pool was actually 2 dip pools joined together, 2ft and 4ft deep, (we were told shut at 17:30, was actually 18:30), not big enough to casually swim in, oh and was in the shade all day so water cold, not even luke warm
Food was ok in the evening but not as good as a lot of local food we'd had around Sri Lanka
Service at breakfast very poor. Had to ask multimes for a table to be set for 3 and had to go and ask for coffee/tea. Plates were all hot, not great for fruit and yogurt and was told quite rudely that they were the only plates. Juice was actually squash not fresh fruit juice. Put cheese with nuts on the same plate as the rest.
Had to pay for the better pool which was a bar pool which I presume noisy in July and August

A 4 star, but certainly not a 5 star luxury property. No evidence of a manager greeting guests or supervising staff. The hotels feels more suited to busloads of tourists rather than discerning travelers. Without doubt the views of their tea plantation and the surrounding hills are very nice, but the quality and details of the room left a lot to be desired.
Telephone was not working, the safe was not working, all finishing in the room was so poor, floorboards felt like plastic.
The room was spacious but sparsely and cheaply outfitted.
You have a desk but no desk light and no power outlets. There also are no effective reading lights by the bed, only small bulbs covered by a shade.The safe is old and ever so tiny- couldn't fit a camera.
Shampoo and shower gel are on the opposite side of the room from the shower- there is no shelf near the shower so you have to run back and forth while showering. Bathroom is very bare. And to top it all off - sounds trivial but it isn't - especially for the price you pay here and for the image 98 acres wants to project - the toilet paper is so thin, I don't think it is more than a leaf thick 1 leaf. Come on 98 acres!
What was a real distraction for us and what will definitely not make us come back here is the noise that travels over from the party pool, which the same owning company as 98 acres, built just around the corner from the resort. It's a party pool, where people from anywhere can buy packages to use the pool, the bar and some VIP balcony. This place gets so loud with disco beats and people raving away that it drove us mad. A constant boom boom boom is too much. 98 acres should make their guests aware of this. Some may have no problem with this noise, but others like us came here for the peace and quiet and the landscape. Don't expect much except lots of opportunities to party into the night (for a fee - also for 98 acres guests). This is certainly not an exclusive, quiet resort..... Also, it seems that they keep building new houses - as it is the swimming pool here is very small and with even more rooms coming up, there will be no choice, but to pay for pool packages over at the party pool. Someone sees only money in front of his eyes and forgets that his biggest asset here should be nature not noise!","Misleading - not a luxury property","2023-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r880032048-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The room, despite being marketed as a premium option, had no windows and was surrounded by four plain concrete walls. While the room was kept clean, the ambiance didn’t reflect the high price tag at all.

We booked the half-board package, but the food was very basic and repetitive. There was little variety in the dinner menu – mostly dosai, kottu roti, and similar local dishes. Prawns were occasionally on the menu but would often run out quickly, even before we arrived for dinner. The meals felt cheap and uninspired.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, which was one of the few highlights of our stay.

Another downside is the location – the hotel is about 20 minutes outside of Jaffna city, and you'll need a taxi every time you want to go in. Surprisingly, they don't offer free pickup from the train station, which I found disappointing given the hotel's pricing and positioning.

Overall, I don’t think this hotel offers good value for money. There are many other options in Jaffna that are better and more reasonably priced. I strongly recommend doing thorough research before booking.","Disappointing","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d12210527-r1003743266-Fox_Resorts_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",

We had a mixed experience, the hotel certainly did not live up to the reviews we had read here. There are some positives, the food is great and the garden area is lovely, the bunker area is also very interesting. We booked a room in the main house but it was dark with extremely noisy AC and mosquitoes (no net over the bed) and so we moved to one of the newer rooms in the gardens when the manager could not fix the AC. The newer rooms are not very old, however they have not aged well and the bathroom particularly is in need of some repair and replacement. With regards to Covid, on day 1 staff were all wearing masks but by day 2 staff rarely were which we thought was odd, particularly as parts of Jaffna were quarantined during our stay.  All in all it was not a bad stay, hotel choices in the area are very limited and this hotel generally was cleaner than a couple of other hotels we looked at whilst we were in the area.","Average","2021-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d12210527-r786824545-Fox_Resorts_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",

Regarding the added taxes. I appreciate your concern. In Sri Lanka, hotels charge a 10% service charge which is distributed equally to all staff. There is also a value added tax of 18% levied by the government together with a 1% tax from the tourist board. This is how hotels in Sri Lanka in the formal sector operate. No doubt there are some informal establishments that may not comply fully with the law. 

If you had raised this question during your stay, I am sure the team would have explained it, potentially avoiding the need for a two-star review, which reflects poorly on the service team. 

I would be happy to clarify anything further if you would be good enough to inbox me.

We've now switched the WhatsApp system to a dedicated service center and response times are quick. My apologies that it wasn't implemented during your stay. 

Cape Weligama has just 39 villas and suites spread over 12 tropical acres. Whilst the local area it’s quite “happening”, the resort itself is more about serenity and a lovely location.

The speed of service in the restaurant was also admittedly slow for the first couple of weeks but that was resolved. 

Regarding the airport transfer, for sure Uber will be cheaper -- a hotel vehicle and the chauffeur for the two-hour journey would generally be more expensive than Uber as the level of service and amenities would be different.

I have to say the staff are lovely and very polite and helpful, but that’s the only real positive thing I can say.

The room I had booked had a damp and musky smell and felt incredibly dated. It was right next to the main road and there was loud music pumping so I asked to move rooms which they did. They moved me to a lovely room with a pool and while it was very nice, again there was just a strange smell in it.

While the resort is pretty, there doesn’t seem to be any ambience or atmosphere at all. 

They asked for my number on arrival so they can communicate by WhatsApp, they got my number wrong and when this was corrected, they still didn’t WhatsApp me. One night what I was waiting for a buggy, it didn’t show up and I was waiting for 15 minutes.

WiFi at the resort isn’t great outside of your room. It doesn’t work at the main pool.

The gym is good but again, just an odd smell there.

The service for all meals was incredibly slow, expect to wait at least 25-40 minutes and the food just isn’t worth the price. It’s very expensive and the quality isn’t worth what you get.

As I said, the staff are lovely, but when I come back to Sri Lanka I definitely won’t be staying here again.

They also quoted me $265 for a taxi to the airport when I was leaving and you can literally get one on uber for under $80.","Not worth the stay","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r994142701-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

However, this place didn't measure up to those properties for numerous reasons.  Unlike those hotels' incomparably elegant style and thoughtful amenities, this comes off as a generic luxury hotel with large but average-looking rooms (no art on the walls, no stylish touches).  Our room was at the edge of the sprawling property (room 52, avoid) and had a strange and unpleasant smell, which staff tried to cover by spraying with a room deodorising spray, with only fleeting success.  There were several problems with the plumbing, including a toilet that wouldn't flush properly and broken steam shower.  The night of our arrival we waited 15 minutes to be seated at the restaurant, even though they do not take bookings; we also waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  The family pool had no swim toys to offer besides a ripped, half-deflated football.  The moon pool (which we only discovered the last day of our stay) was wonderful, but children are not welcome there.  The location and views are amazing, and these flaws might be forgivable in a mid-priced hotel, but the astronomical price of our stay combined with the hotel's deficiencies in comparison to the other Resplendent Ceylon properties, plus the fact that Welligama itself has a ton of other more convenient options, makes this hotel feel like a bad bargain all around.","Astronomical price for average rooms and poor amenities","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r987616624-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

Pool lights ordered in August from the United States have still not been delivered due to the global supply chain issues. We have now been assured of delivery next week. Your pool has five mosaic tiles fallen off - due to high occupancy we have been unable to empty the pool to repair. Pool cleaning is done daily yes but in between leaves etc can fall in. There was an unprecedented nationwide power outage when you were with us and the generator does take about 30 seconds to switch over. Your welcome cocktail was ordered from the Cape Club to be sent to your room, however you arrived at the Ocean Terrace and ordered a fresh set of cocktails which was billed and later reversed. The gym was being deep cleaned by housekeeping when we turn the air-conditioning off. Sunbeds we had allocated 2 on your terrace and more by the pool. Note paper and pens had been removed as part of our Covid safety measures and will be re-introduced shortly.

Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad that you found our staff attentive and service oriented and the views spectacular. The management are usually equally helpful but having reviewed the incident logs during your stay, I can understand how their patience may have worn thin.

On arrival you complained that your room was not immediately next to the other room that your family had booked - as we were completely sold out, we could not do any better and you acknowledged that you were aware that the rooms would not be adjacent.

The “wholly inadequate” junior suite sized at 130m2 or 1400ft2, that you claim looked out onto a wall, looks out onto a large terrace and garden and beyond that the pool and the ocean. We understood that you wrote the room off as you wanted to move to the room next to the rest of your family but it was occupied.

You insisted on a discount and threatened to leave if we could not provide one. We were not in a position to offer you your discount and reluctantly accepted you leaving although we would not be able to resell the rooms at such short notice. We were glad that you chose to stay.

We accept full responsibility for the power failure the next day due to unscheduled maintenance by the electricity board at a time when our backup generator was undergoing a major repair. This was entirely unexpected and clearly very inconvenient for which I apologise profusely.

The golf buggies did require about 5 mins notice as we were running a full house.

The main restaurant Ocean Terrace has a wide menu and our chefs are keen to prepare special dishes off the menu. We also have the Surf Bar which is popular for lunch and Tableau; the chef’s table, at dinner. Three options for just 39 villas and suites have not been previously found inadequate.

I wouldn't normally go to such detail in responding but since your stated intention was to alert fellow travellers, I thought I should address all your points so as not to mislead.

It was really so bad that we wanted to move and so advised the ""management"". Unfortunately, being the period between Christmas and New Year, nothing was available, so we were just stuck there.
Among the many problems we faced:
1. The Electricity went off for a whole afternoon. This, by itself, was not all that bad but then then the water systems gave up. The toilets were unusable etc etc. Most Unpleasant.
Nor was anyone able to suggest alternative arrangements or even give us an idea of when normalcy would be restored.
2. The wait for golf carts was endless. It appears they have just one or, may be two, for what is a very large property. Given the rates they charge and the value they deliver, surely they can afford a couple more and help their guests utilize their time effectively.
3, There is only one restaurant on the property, and no decent eating out options close by. By the end of our stay each of us knew the menu by heart (as an aside, the views from the restaurant are spectacular).
4. The staff was most attentive and service-oriented, as is true of Sri Lankans generally. However, there was a certain degree of arrogance in the management, which really was quite unnecessary and totally out of place in the Service industry.
So, fellow travelers, Go if you Must but please keep your Expectations at Sea Level.

The location was beautiful with the infinity pool and the layout. Some staff were welcoming however we were highly dissapointed by the end of it. First of all it is a member of relais et chateaux which obviously meant to us that they would serve good wine, but that was not the case. The first red wine tasted like it was left open for ages. Then the service was so poor we had to wait for ages to get the food. The duck was nice but the srilankan kotthu was awful. Me being a local, felt like I could get better from the street restaurants for 1/3 of the price. Then the mocktail ordered for almost 1000 rupees was awful too with no taste. When we had finished our dinner it took them ages to clean our table. When we ordered a liqiour at the end of our meal it took another century to arrive. Then we asked for the bill and it again took forever until we kept reminding them to bring it.Finally the bill arrived and we saw that they had charged 12500 rupees for a white wine bottle that we never ordered. The overall bill came to around 24000 rupees and I left the place still hungry as I could not eat what i was served. Once the bill was rectified they took our credit card and had to go all the way to the reception (which is not close by)as the card machine at the restaurant was broken. Once paid we went to the reception to ask for a vehicle to bring us back to our other hotel and they had no cars available. They were kind enough to offer their staff vehicle, however for the standard that's given to this place, we would have expected them to have their own cars for guest service. Knowing that this place has a high number of oversees guests you would think that some of the staff would speak a good level of English. However, we were surprised to hear them struggle to speak and understand us. As stunning as the location is, more attention should be dedicated to the restaurant management and services. There was one attentive staff member who was the only one who kept coming to refill our water glasses!","Overrated","2016-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r418673263-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is very nice, our stay did not meet with our expectations based on their website, reviews, and price paid in comparison with other hotels we stayed at. 
Our first misgiving was when we saw our ""master rooms"", sure
they were huge and lovely but with a location like this and a website full of the most majestic ocean views (and $500 per room/night!) we had taken for granted that all of the 39 rooms in the 12 acre resort designed by Asia's most celebrated designer would have ocean views whilst ""capturing the spirit of Cape Weligama""! Well, none of ours did and I didn't complain as I rechecked their website, nowhere does it say that these rooms are ocean view. (I've seen now that we are not alone and many 
reviewers who have stayed in the master rooms have had the same misgiving and disappointment. We also stayed at The Villa Bentota where one of our rooms was the executive suite and their website clearly mentioned that this room ""does not offer sea or garden views"".)
We did not let this dampen our spirit and my son, who is a Foodie from NewYork and my daughter, Swiss hospitality Grad, booked the Seafood Special buffet for that evening. I believe they had seen photos on Instagram and were excited, knowing that as a Relais & Chateaux, a high standard could be expected. Again we were disappointed, service was poor to start with and pretty soon non existent! Did not even ask us if we would like desserts, we got up to order these and decided to have these sent to the room because the atmosphere was now dead and the mosquitos were biting! Yes, it was local new year festival,
but at any top rate hotel in the world, any day you're open to guests, you're working! The Seafood itself was of good quality and plenty but somehow not served elegantly. Also in a rush to clear the cold buffet which we had less than half hour to pursue, could have easily kept on for a further 15 minutes,
but didn't bother. We felt like second class customers although
we had paid full price! 

The butler tried hard to please but I didn't quite understand their concept. Our butler told us he was in charge of 8 rooms, he's personally bringing in room service orders, including breakfast, driving the golf cart sometimes, doing some concierge work, running errands, and when you call for something at reception, they don't help you, they will your butler call you back. All in all, we did not feel that the service we received was in any way special or dedicated. I requested jugs of iced tea as I do not have canned aerated soft drinks or alcohol which are free in the minibar, only to see that this was on my bill at check out!
Our rooms were next to the main pool, decided to go swim the half moon pool and take some photos. Great views lovely photos, we got some excellent memoir shots. The pool however was just being closed, I don't remember the time but it was not yet dark at all! Neither does this moon pool appear to be 60m in length! We went to the cove pool to swim, I was the only one doing laps in the ""integrated 20m lap"" pool. You need to travel through the whole pool to get to this part! And by now there is no staff attending the pool here as it's 7pm! With 14 pools in the resort perhaps a dedicated pool for swimmers who would like to do laps that is convenient from the master rooms, perhaps with breathtaking view might make up for rooms being no ocean view? 
Checkout was also handled smoothly, however again we felt not the type of send off you would expect from a Relais & Chateaux. No Manager was present, it was like a checkout at any standard five star hotel.
Well our six person family, very traveled and stayed in many ""superior"" resorts on six continents, we're not overly impressed in any way by this hotel or its management. We are very, very impressed by the property so their is a lot of room for improvement if they so wish to do so. Another reviewer mentioned Trisara as an optimum choice, I'd like to add Phulay Bay, a Ritz Carlton reserve where we've stayed.

The food is absolutely horrible- it's boring, it's bland, it's repetitive and it's not tasty AT ALL. I would say my biggest issue was the horrible food- fruit was delicious though. 

The room is nice, but it's missing something aesthetically. Our phone had issues and didn't work for most of our stay, so it was annoying when we wanted to reach our butler or we had issues in the villa. The car transfer was just SO sad. It's about 500 usd and you aren't even greeted with cold towels and a bottle of water, forget that the car was a piece of junk. We have been to Sri Lanka in the past and stayed at both Aman properties and the car has a sandwich for the long drive, a cold bottle of water, and cold towels. It was just so much more professional and you truly get what you're paying for, as opposed to Cape Weligama where the private transfer was a joke. 

The adult only pool had a child swimming in it, lots of staff cleaning and fixing all over, the villas don't really have an 'ocean view', we had a wifi issues, the beach isn't easy to access, so don't go here if you want a beach hotel. Lots of hiccups along the way and compared to our trip where we stayed in Aman, Cape Weligama doesn't even come close to that experience or the standards of the hotel.

The red wine was served ice cold. We had to wait 20 minutes for it to reach a drinkable temperature. As a result, we only ordered one glass — otherwise, they could have easily sold two. A basic understanding of wine service was clearly missing.
The live saxophone player was unbearably loud, more fitting for a nightclub than a restaurant. We asked the staff to lower the volume so we could have a conversation, but they completely ignored the request.
The pizza was obviously frozen and pre-made. When we raised our concerns, the chef came out and demonstrated how he ""normally"" makes pizza — what he prepared then was clearly fresh, and completely different from what we had been served. Yet they refused to admit that our original pizzas were not freshly made.
The service was inattentive and disorganized, with absolutely no regard for customer satisfaction. The staff lacked coordination, and the management seemed absent or ineffective.
The venue itself is in poor condition, not what you'd expect from a place positioning itself as a fine dining Italian restaurant.
To make things worse, we were charged for three pizzas, despite being told the first two would be taken off the bill. It took them 15 minutes and involvement from six different staff members to correct the invoice.
An awful evening from start to finish. Mismanaged, overpriced, and unprofessional. Highly not recommended.","What a crazy disappointment","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d28123947-r1014230700-Amari_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We were deeply saddened and concerned to read about your bitterly disappointing experience at our hotel. We understand you were looking forward to your stay, especially after a long day of travel, and we sincerely apologize that we failed so significantly to provide the positive and impressive experience you expected from a hotel in Kandy.

From the unsatisfactory pool area and extremely limited bar offerings to the frustrating issues with in-room technology, room service access and timing, missing amenities from housekeeping, and a subpar breakfast experience – it's clear that we let you down at almost every turn. Please accept our profound apologies for this cascade of failures.

This is not the experience we want for any of our guests. Your detailed account highlights critical areas where we must improve immediately.

We acknowledge your feedback that much work is needed. Rest assured, your comments are being treated with the utmost urgency and had been shared directly with all relevant department heads for review and corrective action.

Upon looking at the drinks menu my friends wanted a couple of cocktails. There were 30 on the menu but were told they could choose from only 3 and they had only 8 bottle of liquor behind the bar! 

We tried to get the movies to work and were unsuccessful. Then we decided to get room service but the menu would not load on the TV and there was no hard copy. Asked for one to be brought to the room but it wa only the beverage menu. By the time it arrived it was 10.30 and they didn’t tell us room service stopped at 10! 
Next day our rooms were made up but no towels left. Also no conditioner. Was later told the shampoo is also a conditioner which is not suitable for a lot of people and there was nothing to explain this on the labeling. 

Breakfast was very average. Fruit was terrible quality and was not refreshed so what there was ran out.

However this hotel surely was the worse hotel we stayed in Sri Lanka and probably in most of the countries we have stayed in. Most of the other positive reviews make me weary reading from people who have not written other reviews elsewhere. 

Me and my Mum stayed in this resort recently for 2 nights, as part of a 2 week tour of Sri Lanka. We used it as a base when in Sigiriya and to walk up the rock / fortress. We arrived at the hotel - no proper welcome like we had at all the other hotels. Which is fine for us. Rooms very tired and definitely in need of a refurbishment. Breakfast and dinner variety was decent. 

On the day of the walk, my elderly Mother (63) who is very polite and never gets angry or upset, kindly asked the restaurant to fill our insulated water bottle with water. We both made a New Year’s resolution to stop using plastic bottles even when away. Bearing in mind the hotel provide water bottles in the room! The restaurant manager refused and kept saying no, in a very rude angry manner. Told her to buy water instead as they won’t fill it up. She was really shocked, he then said he will only fill one bottle not both… this is the normal jug water not no fancy Evian water! If locals and customers in the restaurant can drink it - did not see the issue. Surely it’s cheaper than us using the bottles in the room! My mum went back to the lobby in tears. 

I came down, saw her upset and was so shocked to hear what happened, never in my life have we been refused free water especially in the hotel. Other hotels in Sri Lanka would go out their way even put in ice to stay cold!! The hotel we are currently in walk around offering water. I spoke to reception who kindly filled the other bottle but no apology nothing. No one cared or was bothered. 

Ruined our mood and excitement for visiting such an amazing place. Even when we checked out no one asked anything, apologised, nothing. Very confusing when Sri Lankans seem like amazing smiling hard working people but not in this hotel! 

The next morning at breakfast, there is a guy who makes masala tea, for some strange reason he even shouted at me ‘just wait’ when I kindly asked for masala tea. Then carried on serving the European couple next to our table who asked for tea after we did. If the staff work on tips then tell us we will happily tip if it means getting respect and service. Really poor service. 

Again upset us on the day of check out. Would definitely not recommend this hotel or stay again. The hotel have no respect. You see the staff rarely smile or say hello like other hotels in Sri Lanka. Some staff were nice but never have we experienced such poor service. Our tour guide agreed not acceptable as he was there.

Pool was nice and had such an amazing view. They should however ban people blaring loud music from their speaker. A group of locals had the music so loud playing their own music staff said nothing. The couple next to us left the pool angry and said they wouldn’t recommend this hotel.","The worst hotel we stayed in Sri Lanka","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r993732569-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

A second request was required before we got proper towels. Bathroom was not clean.  The room safe didn't work, though this was rectified.  Someone came to confirm we had no hot water, but did nothing about it.  The room was not made up as requested, though this was subsequently fixed.  We did the best we could and after complaints to senior management our whole block had hot water the second night.  Staff looked overworked.  Buffet was ordinary.  The wifi worked.  Management were given an opportunity to make a better impression on us, but didn't even try.  Great location with Sigirya rock towering behind the pool but we would not stay here again.  Perhaps the majority of tourists put up with what we experienced but I do not regard  the lack of the basics as a good sign.

Instead of moving us to another room, he then went and got a handy man . The handy man could not make the water hot either. I went to talk to the reception lady and she said the hotel was full and could not move us and offered us free drinks which I refused. I asked to see the manager who finally came and said he could move us! there were other free rooms. By then it was 10:30 and my partner was asleep in the room so I refused!.

An OK location, but an absolutely appalling experience. Would not recommend anyone to stay here.

The air con in the room while working, kept spitting out water onto the floor.

The bicycles we rented were poorly maintained. Holes in the seat, broken gear shifter and the chain fell off while riding. I ended up with grease all over me fixing it and they still decided to charge me for the bike and the laundry.

The laundry we had done, they had decided to classify my t-shirts as full shirts even though they are clearly t-shirts.

The woman at the front desk gave the impression she had no interest in being here at all (this was across two days!), most of the staff were rude and abrupt.

The manager at the front desk had several charges on our bill that they could not produce receipts for. And rather than being polite and helpful they were rude and arrogant towards us. When asked for feedback at checkout we mentioned about the bike to which she shrugged her shoulders and said "" normal"". 

The only upside is the view (which can only be seen from one specific spot) and the buffet which was decent.

Don't bother booking this place, not worth the money or experience

Cheguei as 13:00h no hotel e me disseram que o quarto ficaria pronto as 14:00, então fui almoçar. Retornei as 14:30 e o quarto não estava pronto. Fui ao Spa (péssimo, relato depois a experiência) e retornei as 15:30 e me disseram na recepção que ""todos estavam em uma reunião"" e que eu tinha que aguardar. Informei que eu estava desde as 13:00hrs aguardando meu quarto e que não iria mais aguardar, só depois disso alguém apareceu e  fui ao meu quarto. Na reserva pedi um quarto calmo e tranquilo: me deram um quarto ao lado do banheiro público do hotel, na frente do bar e da entrada de carros para a recepção. Fui reclamar e fui atendida pela Thilini que disse que eu tinha obtido um upgrade de quarto, se esse era o upgrade imagino o que seria o quarto que eu reservei!  Porém, fui conferir no site do hotel e aquele era o quarto que eu tinha reservado, portanto, ela mentiu! No jantar, nenhum garçom se aproximou de mim perguntando se eu queria beber alguma coisa ou se precisava de algo, ninguém para explicar como o buffet, incluído na diária, funcionava. No final do jantar,  uma moça se aproximou de mim e perguntou como tinha sido o jantar e eu respondi que tinha sido péssimo e expliquei a situação. Logo depois o responsável pelo restaurante (assim se apresentou) veio perguntar o que havia acontecido, expliquei novamente e disse que os garçons só se ocuparam das mesas com grupos e não das demais e ele pediu desculpas, mas ninguém veio a mesa depois disso. O Spa é todo aberto, com muitos mosquitos e barulho, além do mais estavam fazendo uma reforma no spa e quando estava na massagem relaxante  barulho de obra, de conversa , impossível relaxar! Tive que reclamar 2x para o barulho parar. Se o spa estava em obras, não deveriam oferecer os serviços, que aliás são bem caros para os padrões  do Sri Lanka. Como se não bastasse, era um homem que faria a massagem e em nenhum momento fui avisada disso!  Na manhã seguinte pedi um tuk tuk na recepção e me disseram que era para eu ir até a rua e tentar pegar um que passasse. Um hotel desse padrão não pode chamar um tuk tuk para um hóspede??? Em outro momento, a Thilini veio me perguntar se tudo estava bem e eu repeti a péssima experiência no Spa, no jantar e o péssimo quarto e informei que na manhã seguinte iria para outro hotel. Ela me propôs ficar mais dias no hotel, insistindo muito nisso, e que me trocaria de quarto. Eu disse que em hipótese alguma permaneceria no hotel, pois todo o serviço era péssimo. Essa moça parece ser alguém que tem a responsabilidade de verificar junto aos hóspedes se tudo está indo bem, se  estão precisando de algo, porém se mostrou extremamente despreparada para resolver os problemas que eu relatei, pois nenhuma solução foi dada, só me dizia "" fique mais dias e te darei um quarto melhor"", ou seja, não entendeu que o problema não era só o quarto. Em nenhum momento pediu desculpas pelo ocorrido e ainda se mostrou antipática e descontente com minhas reclamações. Parece que é preparada apenas para ouvir elogios. Péssima profissional!  Em resumo: não recomendo esse hotel em hipótese alguma! Esse foi o pior hotel que fiquei nos meus 22 dias de viagem pelo Sri Lanka! Se quiser apreciar a paisagem da piscina, vá lá só para tomar um drink.  Outras opções muito melhores na região. Saí de lá e passei mais 5 dias no Cinnamom Habarana: o paraíso!!! Fujam do Hotel Sigiriya!","O meu pior hotel do Sri Lanka","2024-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r943272265-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you very much for staying at Hotel Sigiriya & thank you for review on our page. And we must say that, as it's regarding a lost thing, it was a side mirror of the bus which you travelled. And we helped you by showing the CCTV footages to make sure that no body has stolen it during it was in the park. And there was no any evidence that you can confirm it was stolen. Please be kind enough to be patient on incidents like this. And you were asking lunch as a compensation for the side mirror. For that even the management given you a better option. But you all were not satisfied on that. Again the thing what we should tell to you is, you have enjoyed your stay at our property. And you wrote a valuable comment our comment book with you own signature. But now you are complaining in some other way. Hope it's only about the compensation which you requested & we were not agreed as it was not justified.
Thank you

Can't believe some of the reviews. Thought this would be my favourite hotel during a 30 day trip in Sri Lanka. Instead it was the worst. The photos are deceptive and don't represent how unhygienic this property is. Have never stayed at a dirtier hotel. What makes it worse is they know. One can clearly see how filthy it is. Not the staff's fault but the upper management of the hotel. Who is there to train staff and inspect their work.  

The shelf above the AC and across from the ceiling fan had not been cleaned in years. Dust was everywhere as well as what looked like mice droppings. All which blows into the air when the AC and ceiling fan are on. Having it go into the lungs as I breathe. After witnessing my room and then the restaurant, I chose not to eat lunch or dinner here. Imagining what the kitchen must look like if they don't care what the guest can see for themselves elsewhere. Afraid of food poisoning. Wouldn't even use the spa thinking the massage tables must be unclean. A hotel's top priority should be to ensure the guests' health. Something every guest should be concerned about if they stay here.

There was a gentleman at the front desk who was a bit dishonest and tried to provide a lower category room from what was booked. When asked about this was told, ""maybe tomorrow because we're all sold out..."" When I asked further, all of a sudden two room options miraculously became available. Also asked about getting change to pay a Tuk Tuk driver for a small bill. ""No change possible."" Ask further, and all of a sudden change appears. This type of dishonesty caused distrust and found it unprofessional. Caused distrust of the hotel. Checking in is the first impression a guest has of a hotel and it was a bit of a failure. It took about 45 minutes to settle the room issue. Once I got in, the lack of cleanliness was a horror and housekeeping came in to do a ""deep"" clean. Which took an hour. A quality hotel would have at the very least sent a note from the GM or a token of apology afterwards. Nothing at all. Not even, ""here's one peanut for all the trouble we caused you.""

You walk into breakfast and there's no one to greet you and take you to your table. You then have to find a clean table where there are almost none. With no silverware. plates, or napkins. No espresso, americano, or cappuccino- the machine is in the bar! Why is it in the bar when those are mostly breakfast beverages? When you see how dirty everything is, you lose your appetite and wish breakfast wasn't included.

This hotel has a lot of potential but sadly no one cares. Certainly management does not. LOLC Holdings PLC should be ashamed to have this property in its portfolio. My deepest regret is choosing this hotel when I had so many others available. Feel like I was lied to and fooled by what they show on their Instagram and Website. What a huge mistake. 

Positive things are the women working at the reception who were very kind when asked for help. As well as a very good restaurant nearby called Saffron Place Lake View Restaurant. Was my favourite of all. Ate there a few times.","What You See Isn't What You Get","2023-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d613020-r931284696-Hotel_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

 We write with reference to your comment made with regards to your recent stay at Hotel Sigiriya. 
As you know when the above complain was made to us we immediately contacted the local authorities. During the investigation you were requested to provide any sort of document to prove the amount of money you brought to Sri Lanka to spend your vacation which you were unable to provide.
The complain was made stating that you lost your money whilst you were at the ayurvedic Treatment. Furthermore, you did confirm that the therapist was with you full time except the time you went to take the shower. The CCTV footage was checked along with you by the Police  and there was no evidence to prove that the money was stolen in the resort during your stay.
This was your second night in Sri Lanka and you came after staying overnight in another resort in Negombo. And the during your stay at Sigiriya you went on certain excursions too. And you confirmed the money was carried by you all the time during these trips. Therefore we cannot exactly say that you lost your money in the resort. However, this is an on going investigation by the Local Authorities and we are unable to come to a conclusion. 

On a different note our resort has been in the business for more than 40 Years and we are a well reputed company and this sort of incidents have not occurred in the past. And Safety and well being of the guest is 100% rest assured.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

While we are pleased to hear that you found our staff to be friendly and that you enjoyed the buffet on your final night, we are truly sorry to learn that the overall condition of your stay did not meet your expectations — particularly as this was the last stop on what had otherwise been an amazing holiday in Sri Lanka.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the cleanliness and maintenance issues you encountered in your room. The inconsistencies you noted, including missing amenities and the presence of an old invoice, are unacceptable and fall far short of the standards we strive to uphold. Your feedback has been shared in detail with our housekeeping and operations teams for immediate review and corrective action.

We understand how important a clean and well-maintained environment is, and we deeply regret that we did not deliver on this during your stay. Your comments serve as an important reminder of the need for consistent attention to detail across all guest rooms.

Although we did not meet your expectations this time, we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future and provide you with the high standards of comfort and care we are known for.

After 2 days we were allocated a new room (upgrade), but there we were disturbed at 1am by 10 employees from the kitchen who made themselves comfortable on the benches in front of the room and ate dinner there.

Unfortunately, the room did not meet the standards we expected from a five-star hotel. It was not clean, and there was a dead cockroach in one corner of the room. During our stay, there was a wedding at the hotel, but the setting was disappointing. Apart from the natural beauty, the backdrop included a garbage bin and ropes, which did not create a proper atmosphere for a wedding.

The food was another letdown. Items like roti, dosa, and others were served cold, and they did not have adequate facilities to keep the food warm.

On the positive side, the hotel does have a well-maintained pool, and the staff were friendly and helpful. For instance, they helped us unlock the baggage quickly when we misplaced a key.

Thank you for sharing your concerns with us. We sincerely regret the inconvenience and frustration caused during your clients’ stay. Ensuring a seamless and positive experience is of utmost importance to us, and we deeply regret that this situation impacted both your clients and your agency’s reputation.
We would like to take this opportunity to clarify that Blue Breeze is an independent property and is not affiliated with Jetwing Blue. While we understand the similarity in names may have caused some confusion, Jetwing Blue operates separately, and this matter falls beyond our direct management. That said, we truly empathise with your experience and regret that it led to disappointment.
We greatly appreciate your trust in Jetwing Hotels for your tours and understand your concerns. If you have any upcoming stays at our Jetwing properties, we would be more than happy to personally ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for you and your clients. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly so we can assist with any arrangements.
Once again, we apologise for the misunderstanding and any distress caused. We truly value your relationship with Jetwing Hotels and hope to have the opportunity to serve you in the future under better circumstances.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

On November 28th, 2024, the very first day of our organized tour, despite prepaying for breakfast, the hotel charged our clients again, putting us in an embarrassing situation and compromising our professionalism. Our clients, confident in us, insisted they didn't owe anything, and the reception failed to verify the information properly. Our clients then called us for explanations, and while we tried to explain to the reception that the breakfast had been paid for, feeling humiliated, our clients paid out of their own pockets. Such an incident has inevitably cast a shadow over the entire tour, compromising the trust we had built with our clients. We expected much more from such a renowned Hotel chain. As a new travel agency, following the advice of a close family member, we always chose, at least for one stop, the Jetwing hotel for our clients, even for the most economical tours, precisely because we believed in the quality of the service offered. For example, in the coming year, we already have two trips planned where our clients will be staying at Jetwing hotels for several days.

This review relates to an incident in April 2023.  The incident referred to in this review occurred more than 1 year ago.

The guests have already written about this incident in a review.   

Trip Advisor reviews should be about stays within the past 1 year and there should only be 1 review about a stay.

That said, here are the facts.

In the hotel's 9 years of operation, the hotel has had over 10,000 guests.  In all that time and with all those guests, there have been 3 possible thefts.

Guests only reported 1 of those alleged thefts to the police; that was the incident in April, 2023 that the authors of this review are writing about.

The other 2 alleged incident occurred some years before.

In both those other alleged incidents, the guests refused to make a report.

In 1 of those incidents, the hotel consulted with with the travel agency that brought the guests to the hotel.   The travel agency found that there had been a similar incident in the past involving the driver hired by the travel agency who brought the guests to the hotel. 

The other incident involved some property seemingly lost/taken in the same villa where the guests stayed.  The guests in that case has also left their villa unlocked.

Since the incident in April 2023, a number of measures were taken to improve security including the installation of new security systems.  

We can well understand the anger and disappointment caused when a theft/loss occurs.

The guests who stayed in April 2023 said that they consulted with someone who told them that the hotel had been previously burgled.  They accepted this mistruth at face value.  They also apparently accepted the person's account of who was responsible.  They seem not to have considered whether that person may have had an axe to grind.

The Manager and Assistant Manager both worked tirelessly to get the police to do a thorough investigation of the incident.  As a result of their efforts, the incident was investigated by the tourist police, the local police, and the national police based in Colombo.  

That investigation included dusting for fingerprints, taking fingerprints, and seeking to trace the items lost.  

The efforts to trace the lost/taken items yielded swift results.  The national police matched some of the belongings lost/taken with some items found discarded in a field in another district of Sri Lanka.  Those items were returned to the guests.

The guests who last stayed in April 2023 are correct that the theft of their belongings from their villa was likely perpetrated by someone formerly associated with the hotel.  The theft was perpetrated by someone who knew the area, knew how the hotel and security systems were constructed, and who was able to arrange for the the wires of the CCTV on the adjoining property to be cut.   A reorganization of the staff and new security systems minimize the chances of a reoccurrence.

The guests who last stayed at the hotel in April 2023 are not correct, though, that the property is any way prone to burglaries.  There has been 1 confirmed burglary in 9 years of a villa that was unlocked (that was the theft that the guest is writing about).  There have been other possible thefts in those 9 years.  1 of those thefts was debunked with the loss of property occurring off site.

The guests who last stayed at the hotel in April 2023 are similarly not correct about who they blame for the incident.

By reflecting on who told them that there were previous burglaries and who led them to suspect 1  staff member in particular, they may better understand how they have been misled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2024-11-28","OTHER","1",,"Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","We stayed in the Elephant Vila.

The design of the steps does not allow foreasy access and especially easy exiting from the pool. I suggested that either a small railing be installed or maybe a large pot be placed in a position to make it easier for the aged or those unsteady on their feet.

The attached photo shows that neither of these suggestions have been implemented in the last 12 months.

We're sorry you had a disappointing experience.

Our understanding is that you had a reservation on 13 and 14 July 2023 for a villa for 4 people.  The reservation and the reservation confirmation specifically notes the maximum number of people for that villa.

The reservation policies also note that no parties are allowed and that IDs may be required for all guests.

As you note, you invited outside visitors.  This was in violation for a gathering in violation of the maximum number of guest policies.

Our understanding is that when the staff asked for the IDs of those outside visitors, you refused to provide those IDs.

We further understanding that having a 100% no party policy and a no outside guest policy can be disappointing if you want to host a group of visitors in your villa.  

We fully understand that limiting access can cause disappointment to people wanting to host groups in their villa.  Limiting access to the villas to guests only keeps Waterland secure and security is a top priority for all guests.

Asking for IDs of outside visitors protects our guests.  When Waterland opened 7 years ago, we had a guest who had a visitor.  The guest brought an outside visitor.  The guest refused to give the ID of the guest.  It turned out that the outside visitor was a prostitute and mistreated the guest. We immediately implemented a no visitor policy in the villas to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.

The vast majority of the guests who come to Waterland come because they want a tranquil, quiet environment to relax.  Gatherings of people exceeding the maximum occupancy disturb other guests.  When you stayed, for instance, all the villas were occupied and others reported a disturbance.

Regarding the location, Waterland is indeed in a non-touristic part of Negombo that is a 7 minute drive from the touristic part of Negombo.  The area is bucolic.  Bordered by a river, a canal, and a coconut plantation, the area is gorgeous. It's good of you to not that for those who want to be within walking distance of bars, restaurants, and shops, Waterland is not a good choice. 

Thank you for noting the music.  One of the churches on the other side of the river does indeed play music on some days in the morning.  Churches, mosques, and Buddhist temples are integral facets of Sri Lankan society and they do indeed sometimes play music as part of their religious practices.

Regarding power, we're sorry that you were disturbed by power cuts.  Unfortunately, Sri Lanka struggles enormously to provide consistent 24-hour power.  In part, that is because of insufficient infrastructure.  To deal with this issue and to be environmentally sustainable, Waterland has installed solar panels and solar batteries across the property.  Indeed, the roof space of all our villas is now blanketed by solar panels and we have 4 separate locations with solar batteries. We're sorry that you experienced periods during the when there was a delay in the back-up systems providing power.  That is a rare occurrence, but it does happen.  After your visit, we asked an electrician to come and look into what caused the delay.  He changed some settings and wiring and hopefully that will minimize the chances of long periods without power.

We understand that the experiences you had combined to cause disappointment.  We're sorry about that.

Regarding the breakfast, we keep our menu small in order to ensure that what we serve is fresh, expertly prepared, and of consistently high quality.  The general feedback that we receive from guests is that the meals are outstanding.  We're sorry that you found the selection too limiting.

Your experience underscores that Waterland is not for everyone and that we need to do a better job of communicating to guests that maximum occupancies of villas are strictly enforced and that outside visitors are welcome to come join guests in the restaurant, but are not permitted in the villas.

Again, we're sorry about any disappointment caused by the policies designed to limit access and to keep guests safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2023-07-24","OTHER","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Management/staff did not allow to have my family as visitors for a short time during daytime even though I paid for an entire villa with plenty of space.

We're sorry that the guest had a disappointing experience.

As noted in their review, the guest was disappointed from check-in.

Our understanding is that the guest's disappointment began when they discovered that Waterland was not within walking distance of shops and restaurants.

Our understanding is that the guest was further disappointed during the check-in process.

The guest booked the Elephant Villa/Studio Villa by the river.  That vila is a 2-person villa.  The guest came with 3 people (2 adults and 1 child).  The guest contended that this was an error in the booking system.  This is not an error in the booking system.  The Elephant Villa is designed for 2 people and the maximum occupancy is 2 people.  The maximum occupancy (2 people) is noted on the booking system and is also in the booking confirmation sent to guests.

Waterland has other villas for more people.  We have a villa for up to 4 people and we have a villa for up to 6 people.

Waterland charges different rates based on occupancy.  For 1 person there is a different charge, for 2 people there is a different charge, for 3 people there is a different charge, ...  The extra cost per person covers the extra costs of laundry and food.  An extra person charge is standard practice if a guest shows up with more people than are in their reservation.

The front desk staff carry routinely helps guests with their luggage and there is a luggage trolley in the reception area for this purpose.

Waterland routinely checks the quality of linens and has a schedule for doing so.  We buy the highest quality linens from our main hotel supplier in Sri Lanka and replace the linens if they are frayed or stained.

Sri Lanka is a tropical country and there are indeed many insects.  We can well understand how insects can be off-putting for guests who are not accustomed to the tropics.  Waterland takes many steps to minimize the incursion of insects into the villas.  Those steps include door guards under the doors and screens on all windows that open.

The review is a good reminder that Waterland is not a good choice for those who want to be within walking distance of shops and restaurants and that it is important to pay attention to the maximum occupancy noted in the booking engines and in the booking confirmations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2023-03-30","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Location","1","Service","1",,,,,,,"Disappointing experience at Waterland in Negambo, Sri Lanka. I stayed at Elephant Villa for two nights with full board package was far from satisfactory.

Firstly, the booking system seems to be problematic and inconvenient as it asked me to book two villas instead of one for your family ( 2 Adults and a 5 Years Old Child ). Secondly, the front desk staff's behavior at check-in was unprofessional and rude, as they started demanding more money for the child and didn't even bother to assist you with your luggage.

Furthermore, it appears that the hotel's management and staff lack the ability to offer good customer service as they treat guests like a ransom demand without offering any actual value.

The set menu food portions were limited, and the staff demanded money for all additional basic things which are usually offered for free in other hotels.

The hotel's occupancy rate was also low, and the bathing towels, pool towels, and bed sheets were stained and dated, indicating poor management.

To add to my discomfort, the villa door was not working correctly, and the villa was infested with poisonous spiders, bugs, and lizards, which is unacceptable and poses a risk to the safety of guests.

These issues have made my stay uncomfortable and inconvenient, and I have no intention of booking this hotel again or recommending it to other travelers.

I hope that the hotel management takes my feedback seriously and takes necessary measures to improve their services and facilities for the benefit of their guests.","Disappointing experience at Waterland in Negambo, Sri Lanka","2023-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r884218502-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We are sorry that you had a disappointing stay.

We're sorry that you were disappointed by the location.  Waterland's setting in a remote and tranquil location away from the built-up touristic part of Negombo is part of its appeal for most travelers.  As you note, for guests who want to be within walking distance of shops and restaurants, Waterland is not a good choice.

We are sorry that you had a disappointing check-in experience.  Waterland has front staff on duty 24 hours to check in guests. The front desk staff send guests a request to send us their check-in time so we can make the necessary arrangements.  Dinner service ends at 8:30pm.  Guests who check-in late miss the opportunity to order dinner and have dinner at Waterland.  

Waterland has a management structure.  There are front desk staff, there is a front desk manager, there is an assistant manager, and there is a manager.  All the management staff are empowered to make decisions.  In case there is an issue, it is escalated to the next person in the chain: front desk manager, assistant manager, and manager.  This well-structured approach to management recognizes that the best decision-makers as they are the closest people to the issues.  We recognize that some guests like only speaking with an owner and that this structured approach to management is disappointing to them.

It seems that after your late arrival, were unhappy with the check-in process, were unhappy with the fact that you would need to pay extra for extra services, were unhappy that issues were handled by members of the management staff and not by the owner, and were unhappy that the hotel was not within walking distance of shops and other restaurants.  We understand how these issues can taint the guest experience.

Thank you for pointing out that lizards, spiders, bugs, and mosquitoes may make the stay uncomfortable for some guests.  All the interior spaces in the villas have glass, mosquito screen, and felt strips under the doors to minimize the incursion of insects into the villas.  That said, Sri Lanka is a tropical climate and these things can be of concern as you noted.

Regarding maintenance, the billiard table is an antique billiard table from a tea estate.  That is its charm.

Regarding maintenance, the pools are serviced twice per day - in the morning and evening - and have pool filter systems that run additionally.  Naturally, during the day and night, leaves fall into the pool.  There is a pool net next to the pool to enable guests to remove stray items and we note in the check-in materials that guests may call for pool service any time.

Regarding portion sizes, we do indeed charge for extra portions.  We're sorry that you were disappointed by that.  We have not heard any concerns about portion sizes in the past.  For those who fast during Ramadan, we can well understand that normal portion sizes may seem insufficient.

Waterland is the highest rated 5-star hotel in Negombo and has been the highest rated 5-star in Negombo for the past 5 years.  Waterland earns these accolades and the loyalty of so many repeat guests and so many travel agencies because of its beautiful tranquil setting, its convenient location 17 kilometers from the airport, the spaciousness of its villas, the luxury of having a private plunge pool, its strong management structures, the excellence of its meals, its cleanliness, its mission to provide guests a magical guest experience, and the dedication and skill of its staff.  We are sorry that you had a disappointing check-in experience at Waterland and a disappointing stay.","983","681922322","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/12/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922321","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/11/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922320","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/10/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922319","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0f/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922318","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0e/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922317","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0d/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922316","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0c/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922315","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0b/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/0a/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922313","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/09/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922312","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/08/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922311","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/07/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922310","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/06/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922309","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/05/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922308","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/04/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/03/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922306","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/02/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922305","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/01/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922304","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4f/00/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922303","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/ff/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922301","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/fd/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922299","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/fb/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922298","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/fa/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922292","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/f4/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922291","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/f3/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922290","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/f2/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/f1/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922288","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/f0/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922287","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/ef/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922286","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/ee/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922285","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/ed/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922284","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/ec/caption.jpg","1311","983","681922283","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a5/4e/eb/caption.jpg","1311","106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2023-03-27","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I stayed in Waterland for two nights in Elephant Villa with Full Board package. As per me, Waterland in Negambo, Sri Lanka, seems to have several drawbacks that can impact the overall experience of guests.

The location of the resort, situated at a remote place at the bank of river Maha Oya, might be attractive for those looking for a tranquil atmosphere, but the fact that the nearest market is about 5 kilometers away can be a disadvantage, as guests have no other options for food and beverages but the resort. Furthermore, the lack of English proficiency among the staff can lead to communication barriers, which may hinder guests from fully enjoying their stay.

While checking in, the staff member at reception argued with me in poor English, which was very unprofessional. He mentioned multiple times that it's my fault that I was late for check-in. The staff refused my request to connect me with the owner to discuss the issue. As hospitality professionals, the staff should always strive to provide excellent customer service, including clear communication and a willingness to resolve any issues or concerns that guests may have. 

Another downside of the resort is that the staff asks for additional dollars for almost everything, which can be frustrating for guests and affect the overall experience negatively. This may also suggest that the resort is trying to cut corners or that the staff is not being paid adequately.

Moreover, the resort's location by the river and the jungle means that guests have to contend with various insects and animals, such as lizards, spiders, bugs, and mosquitoes, which can make the stay uncomfortable for some guests. The fact that the pool is not maintained decently and that the poolside table is worn out adds to the overall impression of poor maintenance.

Additionally, the hotel's area not being safe and not recommended for couples and kids can be a major concern for guests who are seeking a relaxing and secure vacation.

The issue of the birds and cat not being fed adequately is also concerning, as this could affect the health and well-being of the animals. Additionally, the portions of food offered are not sufficient, and guests are charged extra for additional portions, which is disappointing.

Overall, based on the information provided, Waterland in Negambo, Sri Lanka does not seem to offer a satisfactory experience for guests due to several drawbacks, including the remote location, language barriers, additional charges, inadequate maintenance, and issues with animal welfare and food portions.","Unsafe and for for couples and family","2023-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r883737320-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We understand that you had difficulty reaching Waterland.  We're sorry that you had trouble finding the place.  Such difficulty can be frustrating and can tarnish one's experiences.

Waterland is not in the main touristic part of Negombo.  The final stretch to Waterland on a small country road certainly has one wondering where one is going.   Part of the joy of the journey is how unexpected it is to suddenly cross the bridge and come upon Waterland.  That joy is no doubt lost if one gets lost.

To help guide guests to Waterland, we have directions on our webpage, inform guests that Waterland is on Google Maps, and place directional signs throughout the area. 

How disappointing that your sleep was interrupted by the music from a religious service.  Sri Lanka is a religious society.  Churches, mosques, and temples often broadcast their services.  As you note, these services start early.   The music you that disturbed you undoubtedly came from the church across the river.  The amplified church services do not occur every day, but do occur several times per week.

We installed significantly thicker glass than the building codes require in order to minimize such sounds.  This helps dampen the sounds, but does not eliminate it.

Waterland's location gives travelers a chance to experience life on the river.  Local favor is a previous element of traveling,  but can also have its inconveniences.  We're sorry that the inconveniences were so pronounced for you.

Your disappointment highlights that Waterland is not a great choice for those who prefer the convenience of a large hotel that is more insulated from nature, the elements, and the surrounding community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"106A St. Mary's Road, Negombo 11540 Sri Lanka","Negombo","Sri Lanka","11540",,"106A St. Mary's Road",,"8687328","7.271155","Negombo, Western Province","79.84904","Waterland","455","4.8","8","3","8","48","388","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297897-d8687328-Reviews-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.waterlandvilla.com","2022-04-17","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overpriced and difficult to reach.

Waterland has hosted over 8,000 guests in the 5 years since we built the place.  During those 5 years, we have only had 2 other instances in which a guest gave the property such a poor review on Trip Advisor.  1 of those 2 guests had not stayed at Waterland and was simply disgruntled that they were charged for a room  after not showing up.

Your review was so disconcerting that I called a meeting of all the staff to identify what went wrong and how we could work to ensure that the issues you raised are addressed.

Here is what emerged in that staff meeting.

1. There seems to have been a misunderstanding about your request to have breakfast in the room.   Food in the tropics serve as magnets for bugs and even just a few crumbs can attract bugs.  We never serve meals inside the villas. 

2. Breakfast consists of multiple courses.  It is augmented by tea/coffee, juice, and water.  When we served breakfast on the private decks, we discovered that the food was no longer as warm as it should be by the time it was carried to the decks and that we could not offer the attentive service that is so important to us.  Accordingly, 3 years ago we decided as a matter of policy 3 to serve breakfast only in the restaurant or on the restaurant patio.  While this may seem inflexible to you, it is a decision based on experience.

3. We offer our guests the option to have their lunch (generally a 1-course meal) on their private decks.  If it is raining, dining on the private decks is not an option.

4. My understanding is that you were given the option of having lunch indoors in the restaurant, but that you elected to have lunch outside.   Generally, Waterland does not have many flies, but there are several times each year when the flies can be a menace all along the west coast.  It's unfortunate that flies disturbed you during the lunch and prevented you from being able to enjoy the excellent food.

5. We're sorry to hear that you were disturbed by mosquitos.  There are generally relatively few mosquitos at Waterland.  We have taken great care to eliminate potential nesting places for mosquitos in the garden and we constructed the villas to minimize the intrusion of bugs into the villas.  There are mosquito screens in the bathrooms and generally the only way mosquitos can enter the villas is if a door has been left open.  As an added precaution against mosquitoes, 4 of the 5 villas including the one you stayed in have mosquito nets around the bed.  My understanding from the staff is that you did not use the mosquito net.  We're sorry that you encountered mosquitoes.

6. Regarding a possible roof leak, we have not received any complaints from other guests of a roof leak in that villa and when we looked for a roof leak, we did not find one.  We will continue to monitor the situation, though.  Roof leaks can be elusive.  We have a repair person on staff and will ensure that any roof leak that is detected is immediately addressed.

A holiday should be a joyful experience and clearly your experience was disappointing.  We're sorry about that.

As a small establishment with only 5 villas, we cannot offer meals around the clock in the way that a 5-star hotel can.  We list our mealtimes on our webpage and in our listings with online travel agencies such as booking.com.

Thanks for sharing your concerns about the limited vegetarians options.  Over the summer, we appointed a new head chef and revamped the menu.  The new menu includes a much larger assortment of vegetarian options.

One day a week, we served a Sri Lankan breakfast so that guests can get a taste of Sri Lankan food.  The egg hoppers were not made the day before.  

There seems to have been some misunderstanding regarding seating.  Guests are most welcome to sit at another table and the staff are pleased to change the table settings.  

Regarding the airport transfer, my understanding from the front desk staff is that you were asked to let them know what time you wanted the transport to the airport, but that they did not hear back from you.  Again, this seems to have been a communication issue.  We know how aggravating such experiences can be and are empathetic.

On the day of your visit, our spa therapist was off.  In such situations, we offer our guests free transport to/from another spa.  Again, we can understand how this can cause disappointment, especially if the circumstances are not explained to you.

We're sorry that you had difficulty finding the air-conditioning control.  We have a protocol for showing guests their villas.  That protocol is abbreviated when guests arrive at night as we know that guests want to go to bed as soon as possible.

To facilitate communication with the front desk, we now have mobile phones which we check out to the guests when they arrive.  

We're sorry that your experience at Waterland was a disappointing one.

However, the experience disappointed on a range of levels:

1) The food situation is exceptionally poor. Lunch is served from 12-2pm and dinner from 7-8:30. Since check in is at 2 you better make sure you're well fed, because this hotel is far from town, with no eateries nearby, and they won't even get you a sandwich or a bag of crisps in those intervening five hours. We were shown the menu at check in and it was very limited - chicken, beef, fish or prawns with a side of potatoes and grilled vegetables. There was one vegetarian option which was, hilariously, grilled vegetables with a side of potatoes and grilled vegetables. Sri Lanka is arguably one of the best places in the world for vegetarian food, and we have eaten like kings our whole trip, so this was disappointing to say the least. We checked in at 2:30 and found ourselves getting straight back in a tuk tuk into Negombo to go and get some food at one of the luxury hotels on the beach because there was none at the resort. Since we're veggie we also didn't want to eat dinner at the hotel. We didn't even get back till 10pm since we felt Waterland didn't provide the amenities we wanted - nice food and a luxury spa - and we had to go elsewhere for these.

2) Breakfast was terrible. We went and sat in the dining room and the waiter, who wasn't friendly at all, just began putting food out in front of us. We weren't given a menu or even told what we would be eating. When I asked what they were going to feed us he said egg hoppers. Since you could see into the kitchen I saw them getting egg hoppers out of the fridge and dumping them on plates. They weren't even fresh, had clearly been cooked the night before, were served stone cold (weren't even re-heated) and that was the only option at breakfast. There were also the standard accompaniments of fruit and juice. The coffee didn't arrive until after the food. I also asked if we could sit outside and eat breakfast by the river but I was told I couldn't because they couldn't be bothered to set up another table! The outside tables are two meters away from the inside ones and there's no door. 

3) The hotel website and the brochure in the room offer airport transfers. I attempted to book this TWICE, once via email the day before we checked in and another time verbally when we checked in. Both times I told them when the flight was and both times I was told that the transfer had been booked for me. Then on the day of departure I went to the front desk and the guy there just looked at me blankly and said it hadn't been booked. I showed him the confirmation email I had received and he shrugged and looked confused. He didn't apologise or offer to book transport, just shrugged. Eventually a manager turned up and organised a taxi for us, but not before a lot of stress from us since we thought we might miss our flight! I'm not sure how they expect people to book this if not via email or verbally? The staff didn't care at all. 

4) No spa. Despite it being advertised on the booking site and the website, when we arrived we were told with a shrug 'no spa'. It sounds like it hasn't been operational for a while but the reasons were unclear. Instead we were offered a grubby, used price list for a cheap spa called Jasmin Villas and told that it was 3km away and they could arrange transport but it closes early. We ended up going to one of the other resorts on the beach to get a massage. 

5) Like most of Sri Lanka, there is a power cut in the evening, which is fine, but this messes with the air con, which switched itself off and started flashing a red light. The guy who checked us in didn't show us where the air con controller was so we spent 20 minutes in a very hot muggy room trying to find it (it's hidden on the wall inside the bed just FYI).

6) They have removed all telephones from the rooms! The brochure said that if we had any issues to just call 808, but they didn't even have a phone installed - the wire was still sticking out of the wall (lovely!) but no phone. 

7) A litany of other issues: the water containers in the room hadn't been refilled so we were really thirsty by the morning; they don't serve alcohol at all, which is fine but I'd rather have known that before booking; no hairdryer (but a hairdryer holder). 

Basically, you get a private plunge pool, which is of course nice. But this doesn't even come close to a five-star experience for us. We stayed in some spectacular hotels in Sri Lanka but this wasn't one. 

I've noted some responses from management to previous negative reviews suggesting that the reasons those people had a poor experience is because they were not willing to spend money and because the hotel is not aimed at backpackers or people on a budget, so I'd like to make it clear that we would happily have spent whatever money it took to have an enjoyable and relaxing final evening to round off a wonderful trip, but this was not possible at Waterland, which was among the worst hotels we stayed at on this beautiful island.","Very disappointing, not a five-star experience","2019-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8687328-r664797024-Waterland-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We did not receive a booking cancelation from the online travel agency.

We checked with the online travel agency and they told us they have no record of a cancelation from you from several months ago.

If you canceled several months ago, you should have received a copy of your booking cancelation from Agoda.  If you have the confirmation of the cancelation from Agoda from several months ago, please send it to both Agoda and to us.  We will then work with the online travel agency so that they offer you a refund.

Regarding the charges, local taxes are automatically charged by the online travel agencies Agoda and Booking.com to the bookings.  When you make your booking, these taxes are indicated.  If you look at your booking confirmation from Agoda, you should see those taxes in the full booking confirmation.

In terms of communications, when you did not show up, we reported that to the online travel agency.

From the start of it, checking-into rooms took a few hours than the usual process as they were not ready with our rooms, even past our check-in time. Average rooms with odorous and tiny washrooms (feeling it when you use it). Ambiance is not impressive as you see it in their website and so does the small swimming pool they’ve got. In terms of the buffet, food varieties were limited and less delicious. Overall hotel stay experience was very poor and wasn’t worth for money.

Greetings From Kithala Resort...!!!
 
Firstly, allow me to thank you for your patronage at Kithala Resort during last weekend. We appreciate your review posted on TripAdvisor. 
 
We apologize for all the inconveniences caused to you at the Reception services upon your arrival. I have personally advised the entire front office team in this regard and corrective measures have been taken to enhance the guest services. 
However, your booking was made under a special promotion, and is therefore strictly non-refundable and non-amendable. Hence, we were unable to change the double room to a triple room. 
We sincerely apologize regarding the inefficiency  of the house keeping & front office staff that you claim to have experienced during your stay.
We already taken necessary steps to rectify the mentioned service lapses in order to extend a comfortable stay for all our guests.
Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback and we look forward to your return.  
 
Ayubowan …!!!

Ananda Wickramasinghe,
Manager

Comparing to the web site photos hotel appearance is small. I booked 1 double room & 1 suite with a ongoing promotion. We 4 adults & kid  11 years old. We made the booking for 2 double rooms but I inform the hotel we will have 4 adults & 1 kid will check-in. They inform me for the meals & extra bed 3500 & I agreed. once I arrived the hotel they inform me for the child charging more. apparently rate is more than triple rate for 3 adults. Then I request from Front office before check-in to change it to a triple room, rather than paying so much money for a 11 year old kid. They refuse it & told me cant change the room to triple. Cant understand the logic why the hotel cant change the room double to a triple rate. Then I show them even at that point online triple rate is much cheaper than what they charging for 2 adults & 1 kid. after all I agree to remove the bed & pay only for the meals & share the bed with adults. They dont bother to change or try to do something about my request. I have being to Jetwing, Marriot, Amaaya, Cinnamon hotels recently by and large service is much Superior. Even Housekeeping done twice a day some of other hotels, where in this hotel when I checked-in there was some left over plates from previous stay kept out side my door & it was clear next day morning. No real interest of the guest from the staff except 1-2 staff. Since its a hot season 2 water bottles were finish & we ask from the front office but they straight way say they want to charge. Being in the only suit room in the hotel they didnt care at all of my request providing drinking water bottle. Where other hotels replace water bottles in the evening house keeping service. I assume hotels trat guest as No 1. But here no attention to the guests at all. May be lack of staff or lack of application & training for the staff. Staff seems very tired. There is no PR from most of the staff. I want to ask about places to visit nearby but there is no one in the front office with that attitude. Definitely not overwhelming. Food selection were less but taste & quality is good. No salad plates & I ask they gave me a dessert plate from dessert corner. very compact buffet & difficult to move around.  There were many better options were available nearby so not suggesting at all. Paid extra for the suit room not worth at all. apart from extra space with TV & bar table nothing at all. But view from the room is breathtaking. But still we need a human touch after long drive from colombo. This is my 1st visit to the Theme resort hotels (Malu malu, aliya are well known) but me and my family had a horrible time.Not return again for sure.","Disappointing Stay...","2019-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1576453-r685697694-Kithala_Resort_Thema_Collection-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Checked into room 105 ground floor by the bar. The safe didn’t work and we felt uncomfortable putting all our documents etc in there even after it was repaired with some gaffa tape. The room was tired full of flys and the outside door which was practically at the bar didn’t  seal. We had an early start so asked if we could move to a quieter room and one with a fully operational safe. We were told they were full and no rooms available. We thought this was a bit off so phoned our tour operator about changing hotel. After a few calls we were offered another room 101 much quieter and despite what the number may suggest it was a much better room all round. The management also offered us a free upgrade to a superior double the following night 239. This was a slightly more spacious room on first floor. On further use the hot water went to a trickle and Luke warm, the air conditioning leaked water on the floor, and again a tired room. (Better choice of tea bags though!!) The evening buffet meal was average and we decided  the following night and lunchtime to eat out. Both far better and only 5 mins from hotel . Breakfast was appalling flys everywhere, not had that in anywhere else we have eaten in Sri Lanka. I wasn’t actually sure if I was drinking coffee it was indescribable. Some of the buffet items were cold when they were clearly meant to be hot. We didn’t complain again after our initial gripe as we were leaving the morning of breakfast and seemed pointless.

We had a Deluxe room and a Suite booked. Myself and my wife wend to the deluxe and asked our parents to go to the suit. After some time we just went to our parents room and surprisingly got to know that it is also a deluxe room. Frankly our parents were not aware of the difference. After informing the front desk, they were very offensive and said there is a guest already in the suit and CAN NOT REFUND as well. After calling to the top management they apologised and changed the room. However their excuse was very childish. They said it was a trainee person handled the situation and she did not have any clue what to do. 

2nd Incident - Minor
Even though we had a full board booking, management refused to give a single additional water bottle. Charged Rs.200 for a water bottle while maximum retail price still marked as 50 (at least they could have removed the label or re-brand it)

3rd Incident -Major
According to the hotel policy check-out time was 12.00 noon. Which was clearly written in instructions. On the last day at 11.45am front office called and mentioned that checkout time is 11.00 am and they had already given us one additional hour. I went to the front office with documents and showed them it is 12 not 11. I was ready to check out exactly at 12 and did so. I asked why they lie. Then the answer was hilarious. They admitted that they lied and say the check out time is 11 so that people may go out at least at 12.. hahaaaa. Since instructions are written in English I think they do this to locals thinking that they might not to read the instructions.

Cleanliness
Bathrooms were not clean. bathroom fitting in the shower were heavily corroded. 

Water quality
Water was very salty. Can't have a bath.

No wifi in rooms.

Greetings From Kithala Resort...!!!

We would like to begin by thanking you for not only choosing to stay with us but for further taking the time to review your experiences at the property on this site. 

We are glad that you were somewhat satisfied with some of the services and facilities but we are very concerned about the areas that failed to meet with your discerning taste. We do apologize for the meals and other areas of dissatisfaction. And especially we sincerely hope you will accept our humble apologies and rest assured that chef has been informed on all these matters and he has taken them very seriously and will take the right steps to rectify them. 
Generally we have the senior staff and management of the hotel meeting with all of the guests and when a concern is raised we do whatever is possible to make the guests stay more comfortable because it's too late to do anything once the clients have left the property. In this case none of the team remember you raising any concerns during your time in the hotel.
 
Hope you will give us the opportunity to welcome you again in the near future and let us regain your confidence in our service and facilities.

The first impression at our arrival was very good, the hall was very nice and they welcomed us with a kind of ritual, the swimming pool looked beautiful because is placed in a nice landscape: but that was all! 
The room was dirty and definitely lack of maintenance in the bathroom: the hairdryer was falling of, the shower is not well sealed so we ended up with a pond in the bathroom and last but not least there is a terrible smell.
Moreover the dinner and breakfast were very poor:
1. the place where is served is very narrow so if there are just few people queuing, it seems crowded 
2. the food is not good and with a poor choice 
3. the staff  inadequate and inefficient 
 
It has a potential but it needs a new management that bring it from the bottom to the top.

I have absolutely no clue what the other visitors saw when giving 4 stars, but for sure not a standard good resort in Sri Lanka, because this place it's largely below any expectations. 

1) Food / dinner: bad food, low quality.
Arrived at 20:15 we have been asked to rush for the dinner as the buffet restaurant was closing at 21:30. 
The food was the standard Sri Lanka mix of specialities, with extra Spanish Paela and Italian Lasagne: no comment on those. Everything was clearly not clocked for the dinner, but largely before, maybe from lunch or the day before. The meat was very dry and hard, even the chicken was hard to chew, same for the smelly fish: never found such lo quality level of food in Sri Lanka, neither in the local side road shops ""only for locals"".

2) Room : dirty, very dirty. 
Only thing we didn't found in the room were dead big animals. 
We found on the bed sheets clear dirty signs, probably made by dirty feet or hands. Several hair on the bed. On the floor several dead insects, included on the side bed carpets. Some alive mosquito, and spider. 
Shower full of limestime and mold. 
On the shelves clear stains of previous guest sweet tea or soda.
Bed mattress very old and too soft: was time to change it several years ago.

3) Staff: not welcoming , not kind, with no clue what's ""taking care of the customer "" nor ""customer satisfaction "".
When highlighting the issues with the mosquito they just mentioned that we should have already in the room the electric repellent. We have been forced to insist to have some spray spread around in the room, and the guy was doing that like we asked him to go on top of Everest. Quite impolite finally we managed to convince him to help us. But he was clearly unhappy to leave his mobile phone and come to us.

Conclusion: we'll never come back, we suggest to not visit , we'll ask our travel agency reimbursements and to bring other tourists to this place.

Very sad room. Ripped wallpaper. Dirty, sticky surfaces in the bedroom. Stained furniture. Dirty pillows. Dirty shower screen, dirty toilet, mismatched toilet seat.

Friday night we’re off to bed early as we have an early flight … at 7 pm the pub”Level” turns on what ever Bass focused garbage it has for a sound system and drowns every nearby hotel room in a nonstop wave of bass noise .

The Hilton staff stated it wasn’t their problem , and even when faced with local law and the numbers to call they did nothing , no cares of any kind . Just a deep seated desire that I shut up and stop making  a fuss

I called to enquire about this discrepancy but the staff had no idea what I was talking about. they were super apologetic, which I appreciated but no one took accountability. having paid more than we had initially planned because we were misled on the website, we ended up staying anyway.
There is a QR code that brings up an online menu where the prices are inconsistent with what they charge you when you order room service. again, the staff were apologetic about this but again there was no one to take ownership and really talk to the problem.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel.   We noted that you had several incidents that made your stay uncomfortable. I’m sorry that you had a challenge with the apartment , Music noise and the taxi. It is evident that you didn’t have the hotel’s signature experience that it is known for. I thank you for detailing the events so that it can be addressed internally. I understand that my team had done a courtesy call during your stay, thank you for the positive feedback with regard to the apartment. We hope you consider this to be an isolated incident, and do consider staying with us when your travels bring you back to Sri Lanka. 

Thank you,

Please see the photos, those speak more than the words.... The apartment had an ""old"" look but it seemed ok...until we entered the kitchen...DIRTY!! and in a bad shape! Really disgusting,this is not what you would expect from this hotel.
At least the beds were clean and comfortable,  but one the showers was not working, the knob fell off when I tried to operated it. The pool was ok.  To make things worst, they have a ball room for weddings. When we stayed there there was a wedding with loud music until 5am!!! If they want to organize weddings and the music gets to a certain part of the hotel they should not let guests staying there during that time, we did not sleep at all...just the night before our long flight home. And finally, we booked a taxi for the airport with the hotel, and it arrived 20 min late.

He was arrogant at check-in and convinced that he was totally accurate with his opinions on the booking made, despite Hilton corporate stating otherwise.

How Hilton can ignore such a blatant disrespect for their loyal customers is beyond words.  This person should NOT be a representative of Hilton, especially in a customer-facing role.

My advice would be to stay at the Hilton Colombo, where the staff are welcoming, very customer-focused, attentive and supportive of their customer needs (5* in all respects).

Thank you for your feedback. We also felt very disappointed about your arrival experience. Indeed, we had received an amendment request from the travel agency concerned with the request to cancel your reservation. Upon your arrival, it therefore took some time to find your reservation, but I am happy that we have been able to secure your room despite the received cancellation. 
I apologize this impacted your experience negatively, but am also happy to hear you did appreciate the size of the room and the comfort of the bed. 
I have well taken note of your comments about the airport collection and have discussed this further for improvement.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted at the door by....well no one...the door man was just standing there looking at us unload our own suitcases and when my husband opened the door to enter the hotel, the doorman decided to enter first...
We were eventually helped by some staff to load our bags onto a trolley.  Then as we approached the front desk, we were greeted by a lady with ""yeah?"".  I was so stunned by this greeting I thought she must have been speaking to someone else....but she repeated herself.  The staff showed no interest in welcoming us to this hotel and just wanted us moved out of the way.  
We booked the 3 bedroom apartment for 4 adults and 1 child.  I must admit the apartment was great, clean, spacious, and good amenities.  However the treatment from the staff, or lack thereof, has left a bad taste.  
I called for some washing powder for the washing machine - I had to call 2 times and also ask the front desk in person - the washing powder never came.  I called reception to make a booking at the Floor restaurant for 9 people for dinner and the booking was confirmed,  However our plans changed and when I called to cancel my booking, I was told there was no reservation to cancel...
We called reception to send us a box of tissues, they arrived when our friend who was visiting us came through the door - apparently the service staff had asked our friend if he was going to room 1502, and asked if he could take the tissues with him...
Everytime we walked passed reception, the girls there were either huddled around for a chat or looking at their phones.  The only staff member that was of any help was the house keeping (I think his name was Asanka) who cleaned our room and provided us with an oversupply of bottled water - I think he was trying to make up for the inadequate staff at the front desk,  He did everything with a smile and nothing was ever a problem.  Uncle Cubby please thank this boy from the Wickramasinghe's.
We also had a light breakfast at the cafe downstairs, after standing at the counter for 10 minutes while the waiter served everyone other than me, he looked at me and said - oh sorry I thought you were waiting for your food...I'm sorry I didnt realise I was now one of their wait staff and needed to deliver food and hot drinks to the tables for them??!!
If you are ordering drinks at the pool, please make sure you are specific about your request - I ordered a shot of Baileys on ice - what I got was a glass of baileys blended with crushed ice like a slushy.  When I asked the pool staff to remake it - he rolled his eyes right in front of me and was clearly annoyed at my request to get the drink I originally ordered and not his icey creation.
The pool is good and they also have a small kids pool which my daughter loved.  There is also a small playground as well.
The hotel is right next to food city so this is very convenient.
As I read this review I know some of this sounds petty, however for a 5 star Hilton brand and the price you pay for a 3 bedroom apartment, the service was not acceptable.","Terrible Service - great room","2018-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r579838406-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review of your experiences at Hilton Colombo Residences. We appreciate that you have taken the time to review your stay with us. 
In terms of your comment of the suites looking ‘tired’, we have immersed in an extensive programme to renovate rooms in the last 3 years. All suites from 31st floor (Executive Suites) to 13th Floor (Suites) have seen extensive renovation done and will cascade to the lower floors in a phased manner. Apart from this, the BASICO Bar Lounge, FLOW and Lobby were newly-built in 2014 and 2015, respectively. All these renovations are being conducted to improvise their guest experience and upgrade our facilities, that have been well-received by our guests. There are ongoing renovations happening on the lower floors from 12th floor downwards, which we continue by ensuring that there’s a minimal hassle to our guests. 
I apologise that the impression you received of the hotel wasn’t great, however, I hope that you consider this to be an isolated experience and do consider staying with us when your travels bring you to Sri Lanka.

Thank you for choosing to stay at Hilton Colombo Residences during your visit to Colombo and also taking the time to provide constructive feedback of your stay. Allow me to first thank you for choosing our hotel; it was a privilege to have welcomed a valued Hilton Honors Silver member.

Having read through your review, I am appalled at the setbacks from the unpleasant concierge, mishandled parcel, noise, and room allocation that made that lowered your levels of satisfaction. As you correctly mentioned many of this could have been negated with proper ownership. I do not want to conjure any excuses to insult your knowledge as a well-seasoned traveller, therefore, I will accept that this is an unfortunate experience as a result of our own oversight. The details you have listed here have been cascaded to relevant managers, who can ensure that this does not recur. 

We have contacted you in private to discuss this matter in detail and look forward to your response. If you have any other concerns, please direct them to me at karim.schadlou@hilton.com

Thank you for choosing to stay at Hilton Colombo Residences during your visit to Colombo and also taking the time to provide constructive feedback of your stay. I’m sorry to read your accommodation did not meet your satisfaction. I would like to clarify that there are substantial renovations that have been conducted over the last three years to improve guests’ experiences.
All suites from 31st floor (Executive Suites) to 16th Floor (Suites) have seen extensive renovation done and will cascade to the lower floors in a phased manner. Apart from this, the BASICO Bar Lounge, FLOW and Lobby were newly-built in 2014 and 2015, respectively. All these upgrades are being conducted to improvise their guest experience and upgrade our facilities, that have been well-received by our guests. There are ongoing renovations happening on the lower floors, which we continue by ensuring that there’s minimal hassle to our guests. Guests are informed of this via our website. Hilton, as a brand has a global standard where the Check-In time is 1500 hrs / 3:00 PM and Check-Out time is 1200 hrs / 12 noon. There may be times where we may be unable to grace guests with a few additional hours as the room needs to be prepared for the arrival of the next guest - we are flexible and weigh in on all possibilities so that no guest is inconvenienced.
I am sorry to read that your stay of four days was cut short to one day; we hope you consider this to be an isolated incident and do consider staying with us when your travels bring you back to Sri Lanka. Should you have any further feedback, do consider writing to me directly at karim.schadlou@hilton.com. 
My team and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

 We deeply regret the inconvenience caused due to the overbooking situation on your arrival. While we had informed your travel agent beforehand and were asked to notify you upon check-in, we sincerely apologize if this caused any frustration.

We understand that being relocated to another hotel during your honeymoon was not ideal, and we are truly sorry that the new accommodation didn’t offer the views and ambiance you were expecting. To make you feel more at home, we arranged a honeymoon cake and a bottle of wine as a small gesture of our care for you.

It is always our goal to provide seamless and memorable stays for our guests, and your feedback helps us work towards improving our service further. We hope you will consider staying with us again in the future so that we can provide you with the exceptional experience you deserve.

Adding to the frustration, a simple egg omelet took an unreasonably long time to arrive. For such a basic dish, the delay was unacceptable.

What’s most disappointing is the cost. The prices are excessively high for the subpar quality of the food. Between the poorly executed dishes and the long wait times, this meal was far from worth the money.

While the reception area appears well-maintained, it conceals the hotel's overall neglect. We were given a lower-ground room with a lake view, but it had a strong musty smell, damp air, and visible mould on a lampshade. During a rainstorm, water seeped through the doors leading to the lake, and we had to mop up to prevent flooding.

After a tiring day of travel, we decided to report these issues the next morning. A brief walk around the hotel revealed further signs of neglect: missing tiles and loose light fixtures around the pool, broken sunbeds, and general uncleanliness in common areas.

We’d booked a 5 am safari with the hotel, so we retired early. However, at 4:30 am, we awoke to find blood stains on the sheets from bedbug bites, with bugs still crawling on the bed (photos attached). We immediately went to the front desk, but the safari driver hurriedly took us to the tour without addressing our concerns. Shaken by the experience we decided we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the safari and so returned to the hotel and chose to check out early.

Upon our return, I spoke with Angela, the hotel manager, who agreed to refund both nights through Priceline, the booking service we used. She explained that Priceline would need to contact the hotel directly to process the refund. However, nearly a month later, I’ve received confirmation that EKHO has been ignoring Priceline’s requests, refusing to approve the refund.

This experience reflects a lack of cleanliness, safety, and integrity at this hotel. I would caution others to consider these issues before booking.","DO NOT STAY HERE - BED BUGS AND UNCLEAN!!","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d2229377-r978072377-EKHO_Safari_Tissa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

We've been travelling Sri Lanka now for 2 weeks and the devilled chicken was just bones and my club sandwich was pitiful, having finished the safari late and low on options we looked for dinner elsewhere, but read the reviews here and thought perhaps it was just a bad experience, and to give it another go, this time cesar salads and a tomato soup (I also requested some bread with it) wow no chicken in the Cesar salad and dressing tasted like it had gone sour. The bread for my soup was so tough I actually took it to reception and showed him just how hard it was to tear apart. It turned me red to try to break the bread, he responded ""wow I'm so sorry"" i didn't even have to say what the issue was it nearly broke my teeth. On leaving I also raised the issue with the food to reception but was still handed the bill with no reduction despite neither of us eating the lettuce, soup and rock they called bread. I gave 2 stars tho because the 2 staff that greeted us were friendly and the bathroom and view was nice. AC however was dirty and the beds were 2 single beds pushed together.

DINING HALL....HORRIBLE smell which was not comfortable for vegetarian couple like us. On 26th night they  cancelled the buffet dinner and told us to order according to our choice without a menu card,. being vegetarians we couldnt  order except paratha ,tomato soup,lemon juice,plain rice  and  curd. We were on a HALF BOARD  booking .Still  were  charged for  a simple lemon juice at the time of check out without any prior intimation while ordering. The front desk operators are not professional at all. They didnt regret or apologise for charging extra after explaining the fact that we didnt eat anything on that day due to less vegetarian choices of food.  Instead  the front desk staff kept a long face and cancelled the bill . All these happened during check out  . We were keeping our cool while explaining our bad experiences with them. But the staff didnt bother to send people to load luggages in our car. This is a great insult for us. We didnt expect this kind of behaviour for a bill of SLR 790 from a hotel like this. Our humble opinion is if you are a vegetarian who expect good  dining hall ambience kindly dont book this hotel in future.

They informed the hotel only one day before your arrival to book the safari jeep. by this time all jeeps were booked and we had to arrange a jeep to come from another entrance that is 80km away. we have informed this to you travel agent too. also, you were short of food packs because there were more persons in your jeep than the guest staying at Backwaters. For the extra persons, the travel agent has not ordered food. 
however, we are extremely sorry for the inconvenience during your travel to Backwaters. Please come again and you will not regret it.

The positives:- Although the accommodation is very basic and functional it is in a wonderful setting. There are short walks around the property and areas to relax along the river bank.  It is possible to hire a kayak and take a guided boat trip. The food was very nice although unfortunately, there was not much of it.
The negatives:- We had booked and paid for a full day safari several months previously but this did not happen. We were originally given several different excuses for this but it transpired that the safari jeep and guide had not been booked by the hotel until the day we arrived. Despite being told by the manager that we would not have to compromise, we were actually only out for half the time of the other guests and this was during the hotest hours of the day when most of the animals were seeking shade. The lunch supplied for this safari was poor to say the least.  We were advised the previous day that the lunches would would be very filling.  They were barely enough to feed a child with the chickpea lunch in particular being very small . One person was not supplied with any water so food and water were shared around the 6 adults as if we were on rations. 
The second day we had a morning safari with a packed breakfast. Upon opening the breakfast pack we found only 5 very small breakfast packs, yet there were 6 of us. So again, food was shared and we were again, all left feeling rather hungry.
In summary, this could and should have been a wonderful place to stay and experience Wilpattu. Sadly, it seems the place is poorly managed with little or no consideration for the guests experience.

The only positive factors we saw at the hotel was; 
1. The location is absolutely beautiful & breathtaking
2. The room is architecturally well designed 
3. The staff helped us to visit Belilena Caves & Mannakethi Ella

We really don’t feel worth for spending our money at the hotel because;
1. Although they have mentioned it is a 5 star hotel in their FB page, it is not up to the 5 star hotel standards. Room amenities are not satisfactory. (They provide dental kit if only we requested, time to time we had to request milk & sugar to make tea, noticed that the pool was not properly maintained so didn’t even bother to use it) 

2.The condition of the road that lead to the hotel was terrible!! At the very beginning we were really worried about selecting this hotel for our stay just because of the road as it was damn so broken. If you really concern about your vehicle please don't go there by your own vehicle! 

3.I don't think that the staff is helpful for Local visitors, and if you go their, just BB basis is enough as you can order a light meal at night for a cheaper price than going on HB basis. – Difference between BB & HB is more than 5000LKR (after 20% discount). We went for HB basis and we were not happy with our dinner menu as it included a soup, nasiguran with an onion sambol & ice cream with pieces of peach - they had 2 dinner menus. That dinner was not tasty and not up to 5 start hotel food standards. 

We still feel that if we went there for BB basis, we could have ordered something else for a lesser price & as of our wish. When we asked them whether we could change our stay for BB basis and order something light for dinner, (around 4:30PM) they just said Can’t! 

Should mentioned that we were Okay with their western breakfast but they only sent us the Fruit Juice (which is normally included in the Western Breakfast) only after we requested!!

We are not really happy about our stay at Palmstone Retreat because we still feel that we could have spent that money for a stay at some other place. They just focus on treating well for foreigners but not for Sri Lankans. But their Rooms, view from the room is awesome. The room rate is a bit higher than you would normally expect, and that’s because of the rating they get from the foreigners (& of course they treat them well).

Palm Stone did not live up to it's promised standards & that was our first & the last visit for the hotel for sure!!","Not worth spending your money for a stay at Palmstone Retreat!","2019-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r664621871-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The location of this hotel is up a long and quite treacherous track. It's not signposted and so quite difficult to find. The journey up this hill will take about 45 mins. 
There is quite literally nothing here. No walks or any trips you can take or are offered from the hotel. The guests here were roaming around like caged animals.

Unfortunately it did not meet our expectations. At most I would give this property 2/10. The score of 2 is earned because of;
1 - The location is beautiful and breathtaking
2 - The room is well designed (though not very functional)

Marks were deducted because;
1 - We booked directly with the hotel because we had never stayed at this location before and wanted to make sure that the hotel could arrange a 4WD for us to access the hotel from the closest town. At this point we informed the sales representative (who insisted on calling us ""dear guest"" even after the initial correspondence where they could have seen our name) that we would be celebrating our anniversary and were looking for an intimate getaway. The sales person assured us that special arrangements would be made and that we could dine in our room at our ""Private Dining Table"", but when we checked in there were absolutely no welcome amenities. Forget rose petals and candles, there wasn't even a dining area in the room and we ended up eating at the coffee table in front of the TV. How romantic!

2. The journey up to the hotel is quite treacherous, even in a 4WD. We strongly recommend that you wait at least an hour after eating to travel up that road unless you want your lunch to make a second appearance.  

3. The cleanliness of the room is not up to standard. The sofa and the bed-end stool both were covered in food crumbs when we checked-in.

4. The staff are very pleasant, but need to be trained. Especially on things like room allocation. At the point of booking, we selected the ""Araliya Suite"" because it appeared to be the most secluded room, but we ended up next to a group of young boys looking for a weekend of disturbing the peace. They were in the interconnecting room and for some reason insisted on cutting across our path when heading to the river, which meant they could gawk in to our room through the picture window. They also played loud music right throughout the afternoon and we had to complain to the reception twice to get them to turn it down. 

5. Lack of privacy was a major factor for us on this trip. We were looking forward to using the plunge pool, but there are no tats or blinds that can be used to cover it so with the neighbors we had, we could not enjoy the plunge pool. 

6. The bathroom was nice and spacious but not maintained. Also the toilet tissue was sopping wet when we checked in and the hot water is only good for the first 10 minutes of your shower. 

7. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. Naturally we asked for all meals to be served in our room, and when dinner came we were surprised to see the starter and the main accompanied by dessert ( which was ice cream). We ended up having two soups that night. one hot and one melted mess.

8. We didn't really feel that this property offed us value for money. The room rate is a bit higher than you would normally expect, and Palm Stone did not live up to it's promised standards. 

In conclusion, we had high hopes for this hotel and they were not met. Judging by the other reviews, it must be a good location in general, but it is not the ideal place to spend one's anniversary.","Far Below Expectations","2016-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r444585129-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

Although the Retreat appears to be a boutique sanctuary it falls very far short of the mark.

The Palmstone Retreat lies approximately 5km from the main road (there are no sign posts on the main road so we had difficulty finding the correct turning from the main road). The condition of the road to the Retreat is so bad that our driver was unable to take us. The road in and out is little more than a dirt track and, quite frankly, is  dangerous. We were informed by the staff at the Retreat that due to the amount of customer complaints about the road they are now planning to build a more substantial road but this won't be finished for a long time, I believe. 

On top of that, the hotel does not serve alcohol, although this isn't mentioned on their website. The rooms, although spacious, were dirty i.e. cobwebs and spiders in the shower and not well maintained i.e. the condensation on the windows obscured any view of the river the room may have had and made the room feel damp. 

The only positive part of the one night stay is that the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful but regardless, the Palmstone Retreat was a low point of our trip to Sri Lanka and we would not recommend it.","Very Disappointed","2016-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608523-d8133768-r408529706-Palmstone_Retreat-Kitulgala_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my recent stay at your hotel on the night of 23rd January 2025. The experience was far from satisfactory and did not meet the standards expected from a property of your reputation.

1. Room Issues:

Upon check-in, we were assigned Room 3011 in the old wing. Unfortunately, the bathroom flush was not working, and the basin was choked. Despite reporting these issues, it took two maintenance staff half an hour to inspect and inform the reception about a room change. After 12 hours of travel, this ordeal at 11:00 PM was extremely inconvenient and disruptive.

2. Breakfast Service:

The breakfast experience on the morning of 24th January 2025 was equally disappointing. The restaurant had only 10-15 guests, yet none of the staff was willing to attend to us. The unprofessional attitude was shocking, and we had to call the restaurant manager to ensure we received service. It was evident that the staff prioritized serving foreign guests, displaying blatant disregard for others.

3. Lack of Management Response:

Despite continuous complaints, the hotel manager never approached us to address the situation. The front desk staff and another individual repeatedly apologized without offering any meaningful resolution.

4. Positive Experience:

One staff member, Rayandu (apologies if the name is misspelled), at your restaurant, stood out for her exceptional service. As vegetarians, she went above and beyond to ensure we had suitable dining options.

5. Feedback to Travel Agent:

We had booked our stay through a travel agent, and based on this disappointing experience, we will be informing them to never recommend your hotel to anyone in the future.

Overall Feedback:

Poor room maintenance

Unprofessional and biased restaurant staff

Lack of effective management intervention

Not worth the price

This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel it is necessary to bring these issues to your attention so they can be addressed. I expect a formal response and an explanation regarding the above concerns.

Sincerely,
Nishith Mehta","Poor room maintenance,  Unprofessional and biased restaurant staff, Lack of effective management intervention.","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r991623413-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

I do not usually go for large chain hotels as I think the personal touches can be lost and it ends up feeling too co-corporate, however we thought we would give it a go. First impressions were lovely - there was a warm welcome by the concierge team, and the Christmas tree was beautiful. From there on, it all went down hill. The room was OK - marks on the wall, mini bar not stocked or working, noise of TVs from other rooms but we were not planning on staying in the room that much, so why grumble - it was just for one night. We arrived to the pool - great views and very comfy loungers; we were very happy. We asked for a drink and prices were fairly reasonable given where we were, which was a nice surprise. 1 hour later a drink arrives that was incorrect, but not an issue and was changed. We then ordered some food and the wrong food came out and was also an hour after we ordered - the staff were polite but trying to get us to eat the food we were being served. As a vegetarian, I am not going to eat a Caesar salad I did not order. We were then told we could not have the salad as they did not have the ingredients. My partners food arrived but with no cutlery for half hour and trying to find someone, the food went cold. We decided to leave the idea of food and retreat back to the room to get ready and try the dinner instead, after all, it is Christmas eve. The buffet was a huge carnage with people running everywhere but the quality of the buffet food was good. there was no room to sit inside so we were ushered outside, and met with bird poo all over our table. The waiter did come and remove it but would not replace the table cloth, so we were left with lots of smears around our cutlery. The next morning we tried to get bags collected and there was a delay and reception put the phone down on me several times when I was trying to explain what we required. I tried to get some money changed and the rate was much higher than other hotels we had changed money so we did not bother. I did raise these concerns to the manager, and was met with an apology. Apology was appreciated but I will never come back to this hotel or this chain again. Looks are deceiving and they have lost touch with the personal touches and services, relying on those who can afford to stay there to just pay the money - this hotel definitely has tourists in their eye sight to over charge and take advantage of.  We have stayed in Sri Lanka for 21 nights, and this was the most expensive hotel and worst by a long way. Choose the smaller boutique hotels and save your money whilst getting better services.","TERRIBLE Experience - Exploiting naïve Tourists with what Luxury should be","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r986771596-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We found the food to be extremely disappointing. Whilst the display looked inviting actually trying to eat the food proved to be quite a challenge. Almost without exception the food was either cold and then put onto cold plates or had been left under the lights and completely dried out. 
I wasn’t prepared to complain but the restaurant manager came and asked us if everything was okay. We told him of our concerns and he brought out the sous chef. The main chef was on holiday. 
He and I walked around the buffet and I pointed out the issues I had. He was in total agreement. 
I also explained that the boiled eggs at breakfast were cooked until virtually black inside. The next morning without ordering 2 boiled eggs arrived on the table and they were virtually raw. 
On  the first night my friend and I went to bed at 21.30 hr as we had had a long tiring day travelling. The guests in the next door room were having a party / rave and had their room door open. The noise was unbearable. My friend phoned reception and asked them to address the issue. A lovely young man came up and asked them to close their door. Obviously the noise was then concentrated in our room. 
I phoned reception and was told it would be passed to the duty manager. Some time later we heard a knock at the door of the room next door and subsequently the music was turned down. Some time later the duty manager spoke to my friend on the phone and said we could recontact him if there were further problems. 
The people then moved to the room on the other side of ours and began again. We decided not to recontact the reception and it stopped at 23.30 hours. 
On mentioning this on checking out the receptionist just shrugged her shoulders.

Firstly, let me apologize if you were inconvenienced during your stay with us. I have been corresponding with your Travel Agent on this incident. 

Housekeeping staff do enter guest rooms for cleaning and turndown service. As mentioned to your Agent, no staff member had entered the room the night of your arrival. If the Agent had informed us that no one is to enter the room for any reason, we would have notified the relevant departments. We however, need to enter and check if any mini bar etc. has been used before the departure of the guest. 

As you mentioned, the money was placed in your backpack, which was not stored in the in-room safe. An in-room safe is provided in all rooms for guests to store their valuables. This is practiced by all reputed hotels in the world and our staff educate the guests on arrival and also have mentioned this on the key card pouch that the hotel cannot be liable for any losses, if not stored in the safe. 

We however hope that you have enjoyed our facilities during the short time you spent with us and hope that you will return.

Unfortunately, our experience was marred by a serious issue. After checking in around 6:30 pm, we settled into our room and left to explore the hotel. Later that night, before going to bed, I realized that $200 was missing from my wallet. Initially, I thought I might have misplaced it, so I gave the remaining money to my husband, who counted it and stored it in his wallet, which he then placed in his backpack instead of the room’s safe.

The next morning, after spending about an hour at the pool, my husband checked the money again and found that we were now missing another $100. It became clear that someone had entered our room during our absence and taken the money. We immediately reported the incident to the receptionist. Despite not requesting any cleaning services, when hotel management reviewed the security footage, it showed a cleaner entering our room after we had left for the pool, staying for more than a minute, and leaving without cleaning anything. When questioned, the cleaner claimed he was checking for an electricity issue, which we had never reported.

I was shocked to learn that hotel staff are allowed to enter guests' rooms without their request. The general manager’s explanation that it is standard policy for cleaners to check rooms did little to alleviate our concerns. We were deeply disappointed by the handling of this situation.

While I don't want this incident to tarnish the hotel’s overall reputation, I strongly advise future guests to be vigilant about their belongings and use the in-room safe at all times. Unfortunately, it seems that both the cleaning staff and upper management cannot be fully trusted at this hotel.","I strongly advise future guests to be vigilant about their belongings and use the in-room safe at all times.","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g11914132-d12611167-r964054025-The_Golden_Crown_Hotel-Ampitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

This was noticed by our restaurant staff, and they politely requested that you change and come for dinner at the restaurant.If you enter the restaurant wearing the gym attire dress, it may be a cause for the hygienic issue, as you are serving food by yourself and also geusts are around.

But I had such an appalling encounter at the restaurant that I would never return and could not in good faith advise anyone, especially a woman, to stay here. I can only think that the positive reviews on this site are from hotel employees themselves.

My booking included the breakfast buffet and when I went to eat on my first morning at the hotel, I was told I could not enter dressed as I was (shorts and a sleeveless shirt). There was no written dress code anywhere in the materials provided by the hotel and I was not informed of any dress code at the time of check in. I asked the hostess what the rules are so I could go change accordingly -- but she and another employee named Ajith just kept repeating that I was showing ""too much skin."" During this ten minute encounter, a man also in shorts walked past me and none of the staff said anything to him, making me believe that I was singled out for being a woman. I repeatedly asked the restaurant staff what the guidelines actually are for the breakfast buffet and they could not tell me, yet they would not let me enter (despite allowing similarly dressed guests to enter freely). After returning to my room to change into a long dress and jacket, I was allowed to enter, albeit with many dirty looks from the staff. Upon entering, it was clear that men and women alike dressed in shorts or sleeveless tops were allowed to enter, only I was not.

As I tried repeatedly to explain to the staff during this encounter, having rules and a dress code is of course absolutely understandable -- but this should be communicated to guests in advance so they can act accordingly and it should be applied fairly to all guests across the board.

It was an extremely upsetting and unsettling encounter and certainly made me feel as though I was being treated differently than other guests, despite paying for my room and board the same as they did. I would never return to such an establishment and would advise others, particularly women, to avoid it as well.

1. Customer is not informed the hotel policies before checkin or pay. For example: they will charge you for makeup reasons like if you hangout with your friends around the pool area with soft drink, without pre informing at the premises they will charge you cocage 5000/= LKR when you are checking out . Make sure the call or email and make sure where are the places you can hangout with friend from Maleesha who is the responsible person for this. 

2. They charge you cocage 5000/= per wine bottle if you drink near the restaurant area which is insane, because the bottle price also less than their cocage charge. 

3. One of our friend sick during the stay, he couldn’t make to the dinner buffet, we asked the restaurant to serve a bawl of soup and a piece of bread to her room, then the manager of the restaurant Mr. Ruzzel and Mr.Ravi said they are charging for the service which is out of humanity. No hotel will do that to a human.

4. The restaurant is under staff, used planted are not removed from the table even we asked them to do (images are attached) 

5. Make sure to double check the bill when you checkout, they will charge you for unused services. 

6. Two team members was in the room number 4020, there was a renovation on room 4021 and loud noise and disturbances. Hotel should not arrange rooms for guest near renovation area, they even know what is mean by hospitality. Hotel should hire educated staff.

Thank you for choosing The Golden Crown Hotel as your preferred holiday destination.
Sorry for the inconvenience caused by the payment issue, which may ultimately have kept you waiting.

I’m disappointed to read that it may have fallen short. It would be highly appreciated if you were able to talk in a professional manner because many guests felt embarrassed due to the situation.

May I request that you kindly consider this experience a one-off and give us another opportunity to redeem ourselves and to experience the services that so many of our guests are so fond of.

We look forward to getting another opportunity to welcome you back again.

Finally, after over an hour of forth and back, they offered us a room, but still could not decide at what price.
As it was almost 9pm, I had no choice, but take it.
Finally, I was charged with the initial amount, but points for stay have never been credited.

Hotel is old, bathroom is so-so and pool was probably not cleaned for looong time.
Shower was leaking from shower to all of bathroom - floor was tilted in wrong way (construction error).
Swimming pool gave us skin irritation for several days - we could see that water was not transparent. Unfortunately we realized only during the following day and we could not see it previous evening.

However, my meeting was constantly interrupted by calls from the office. Despite confirming my late checkout and prior notifications, representatives from customer relations kept calling to discuss my departure time. This unexpected level of disruption, especially from a company I've been loyal to, has left me disheartened. I had hoped for better treatment, given my loyalty.

Greetings from Habarana Village by Cinnamon,

Thank you for your great review, and please know how much it means to us here at Habarana Village. We go out of our way to offer our visitors with the greatest service possible, and it always brightens our day when a client appreciates it. 

Appreciate so much for your feedback on the buffet. As a renowned hotel chain in Sri Lanka, we may need to serve to a variety of clients at all times. That is why we may have to resort to this type of buffet. 

Thank you again, and we hope that your future visit will be just as enjoyable.

The rooms are pleasant, depending on the category 
The real disappointment is the atmosphere and the food.
The atmosphere is that of an 'all-inclusive resort' where an international clientele mingles morning, noon and night over characterless “all-you-can-eat” buffets in a restaurant laid out like a 'giant canteen'.
Although I've travelled a lot, and I am familiar and ok with usual international buffets, I've never seen such a repulsive mega-gigantic buffet, with all kinds of international or ""simili-local"" cuisine adapted to a more or less wealthy tourist clientele. 
For me it's a disgrace on two counts:
- firstly, it's really indecent to offer such an infinite choice, even for a varied and well-to-do clientele, in a fairly poor country where the waiters must be embarrassed by such waste! We spend almost more time browsing the buffet than we do eating. I can't imagine the mountains of rubbish after each meal. Nobody needs that !!!
- Secondly, by focusing on mega-quantity, they forget about quality. You can mix just about anything and everything (fruit, curry, pizza, pasta, pancakes, meat, starches, vegetables, spices, eggs, imitation cheeses, 1001 desserts, 1001 appetisers...) and in the end you end up with a plate that's full but tasteless, as none of these meals are cooked properly or with talent. I really missed the good, more intimate hotel restaurants where a chef would offer you a limited but elaborate and tasty menu. And despite this, people crowd around the dishes as if they were going to run out of something! Horrible. 
You feel like a pig being force-fed for lunch and dinner. So, only for those who like to eat without thinking and feel they're getting quantity instead of quality for their money. But some types of tourists like it (especially Russians, Chinese and Americans).
For normal tourists, this type of catering is shameful and is everything I'm running away from.","All-you can eat Touristic resort","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r909207873-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

During the holidays in the last few months, we were booked and staying in different hotel chains. During the last weekend ( 12th -13th Sep 2020) we booked at Habarana Village expecting to have a relaxing peaceful weekend. One of our main purpose of bookings to support the local hospitality industry that has been badly affected by the current local Corona Pandemic and on top of that due to foreigners who don’t visit Sri Lanka for so many months. 
When we arrived at the hotel, the reception was deserted and there was only one person on the desk to do the check-in functions. There was no proper welcome process and after some time we were just directed to our rooms. We had to go and find our rooms on our own. That was one of my relatives’ 4th visit to the hotel but there was no recognition at all.
Then we went to have our meals at the hotel restaurant. To our utter shock, the food serving waiters were serving food to us treating as if we were a set of beggars waiting in line to beg for a free meal. The food was not nicely served to the plates, instead just throwing the items all over the plate on top of the served food. 
After we sat down to eat, halfway through one of us requested a hand wash finger bowl of water from a waiter on duty. The person snapped saying that the sink and tap is available and we have to go to the sink if we need to wash hands. This was said at a moment that we could see other tables were provided with hand wash finger bowls with water.  I have noted some other guests experienced the same as us and complaining to the staff and the management. 
Totally disgusted by the treatments received by us since the arrival to Habarana Village, we didn't have any other option but to stay at the hotel experiencing the mistreatment by the staff as we have had already fully paid in advance.
We have stayed at many Sri Lankan and foreign country hotel chains and out of all this was our worst and disgusting experience ever....!!!!
We were really disappointed staying at  Habarana Village because it's a total waste of our hard-earned money to get so much discrimination treatment as guests at this place.
During our stay, we didn’t experience any positive side other than the nice and calm surroundings. 
Also, we are not expecting any, meaningless apology messages because all of you have cheated on the valuable guest by mistreating the guest so much, and it's beyond repair....!!!!!","discriminate and mistreat the local Sri Lankan guests","2020-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r770575189-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on Trip advisor.

We thank you for your detailed comment. It was understood that your overall stay was not up to 
your satisfaction and that you have not enjoyed the culinary experience. We do regret that there were certain other aspects of your stay with us which did not have a positive impact on your holiday experience. All aspects highlighted by you have been taken note of and looked into.

Recent pandemic caused blockage of foreign travelers from visiting hotels and paved the path for hotel management to make money only from local tourists. Only path for hotels to pay wages for staff and avoid hotels from being closed was to make money from locals with attractive offers. So they started advertising same packages offered to foreigners at very eye catching discounted rates. 
It’s highly misleading and “Habarana Village” provided us with a great example on why it’s a scam. Here are few quotes from employees when inquired about certain incidents which took place during our stay.
“Sir, the management has decided to minimize the items of buffet due to the pandemic(corona)”
“madam, shall I offer you more curry along with the piece of fish?”
“Sir, grill has been limited only for fish”
“We have two flavors of ice cream”
“Sir, if you don’t have a functioning AC facility in your room I shall send the repairing guy.” (it took nearly an hour at 10pm after dinner to get a room to lay down. They started pumping GAS to AC at 10.05PM)
There are absolutely ZERO options for vegetarians except for hoppers and pittu. No Paneer – No cashew or mushrooms. NOTHING!
You should visit Habarana Village if you are expecting to see or get served by a staff member who keeps a grilled pork loin to himself and gives you slight pieces of Pork to you like he is cutting his own body. It’s like they are on a mission to save more food in freezers or visitors for dining them. Haha (I know about the quarantine rules about them being served by staff – BUT they serve you like you can’t eat)  
You can hear plenty of excuses from staff members on why certain things are not provided or some foods are not available (they will tell it’s due to COVID but it’s a huge damn lie). They clearly have minimized most of their items from usual package and offering a third class service offering. Sometimes we could see them being speechless about certain things. It clearly indicated that top management has given them strict order to minimize service to make profit. 
With the prevailing situation it’s unclear whether when Sri lanka be open to foreign travelers. These hotels are trying hard to catch up until they reach here BUT I highly doubt of them losing their star level with third class service offering. 
If you are advertising again please advertise as “BUFFET WITH LIMITED OPTIONS and EXPECT EXCUSES”. 
If this is how locals are treated in a time like this, we are highly disappointed! I have been engaged in hospitality industry for about half a decade and I could sense how management has advised to cut off certain things. I have never left a review on trip advisor BUT this was a must. 

Only plus point were,
scenery and maintenance of garden was good
lifetylist made sure we get requested water bottles just within two mins upon calling

 (and staff members were helpless when it came to inquiring about limited buffet)","Service NOT as ADVERTISED!

* From the car park we were forced to bring in our won Baggage no help was offered, even though the Hotel was only 30 % occupied. . 
* 1st Night bed turn down wasn't done and completely ignored 
* We were on time for breakfast on 28th Feb, the Coconut water had been available but the jar was empty, we ask 3 personal (Action Egg Chef/ A waiter and a Dining Room Supervisor) but no one was interested to serve us Coconut water which is very Common in Sri Lanka, when we made the complain the ( Sous Chef/ F&B Manager ) both said that they were unaware of our request. Which shows that the communication of such simple request is not filter down to the relevant personal. So we booked the second 28th Feb only Room Only
* When requested for Tea from a dining room supervisor offers us Made up TEA ??? WHY would I go to a 4-star Hotel to be served a Made up Tea, instead I should go to a road side boutique for such a Service. 
*The toilet Shower floor was dirty and when made a request to clean the same, the Housekeeping supervisor said that IT is clean and the white stains are from the Wax they have applied to the floor, but for our surprise it is not all over the floor and except near the Gully area, (Plz refer the photos)
* The Shower control is not working when you shower water coning from both drip tap and from the shower so the water presser was very low, this was brought to the Front Office Manager s Notice but nothing was done.  
* Our room only had one Veranda Chair and made a request to the reception to have one, but it was never done so we couldn't sit out for a chat that night.( would you think this is call service this should have noticed when the Housekeeping is releasing room to Front Office staff but they even failed to do so once the guest himself point out the mistake they totally ignored 3 opportunities to correct them self )  
*Over all the attitude of the staff from top to bottom (Management to lower level) and facility for Sri Lankan s were bad, 
*The Hotel ill-treat the Local guest, the hotel only had 77 guest, and it’s around 33% Occupancy, and still they failed to provide some basic facility, 
*When I made the complain we were offered Free Take away sandwich for safari, Evening Snakes, even offer to bring in our friend s to the hotel for a corkage free drink, (we refused all of them as we were badly treated before our Complaint)  
*But on the first day when I request to bring in a Friend from outside we were strongly declined for the same, and were forced to purchase from the bar.
* The stray Dogs and cats were all over strolling around, when inquirer from a Staff member said the Managing Directors Sister is a Dog Activist and hence the management is not taking any action. And this shows that the Management is least concern about the safety of paying gust, The Dogs were seen near the main Dining hall pestering guest for Food. And in the public areas as well.       
* we wanted to see the Manager and was informed the Manager is not in and will meet Us next day,  but he was not bother to meet us , and was Ignorant not to Call us even though they had our Phone numbers  on Arrival ( Local No) neither he has try to contact us on E mail, further more he has not taken interest to write to us through the review which we had done on Bookings.com as we made this booking through Booking .com, He did not had the bone to face the truth or don’t care attitude, this whole situation could have avoided if he had communicated with us while we were there. 

Our short holiday was ruined and suggest that guest should be cautious when booking this property or any Cinnamon property in Sri Lanka, If the management is not have the time to reply to its guest concerns.. We made a post on the properties Face Book Page and it was removed by the management, so Please do not believe the Face book of the property as they only accommodate good reviews in its FB Page.

After reading the TripAdvisor reviews, my expectations were in line with what to expect.
First let me mention that the lodge grounds are beautiful! A very serene atmosphere. The breakfast and dinner food buffet is great! Location is excellent!!
Now to some of the areas that might require improvement:
1. We had three rooms - all had a terrible moldy stench - in order to overcome the terrible smell we kept the A/C, ceiling fan and bathroom exhaust fan running on full speed the entire stay,
2. Instead of one king size bed we had two single beds - the mattresses were very old and poor quality - you sank in the mattress.
3. The room is a nice size! the bathroom is a bit crowded in comparison to the room size
4. They are stingy on amenities - I had to repeatedly request additional shampoo and shower gel as well as extra towels. 
5. I think that they made a mistake by not placing the lodges viewing the lake!
6. Spa prices are extremely high - even higher than what I pay in a western country where the cost of living is much higher - very regrettable!
In summary, I cannot recommend these accommodations! The most important thing is that you can get a good nights sleep, this was not possible due to the smell and mattresses.","Not a 5 star Lodge","2019-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g665220-d579209-r655927252-Habarana_Village_By_Cinnamon-Habarana_North_Central_Province.html",

Booked with Mercury, took a while to get the tickets confirmed but all done and sorted. Did a private transfer from the airport to the hotel and arrived about 8am where they sorted a room for us. Got some sleep for a few hours as all inclusive was from noon. 
Great location although the beach has been washed away. Pool attendants, Sarath, are great and pool bar staff, Dinal, very friendly with both giving great service. Room attendant, Udayagna, left towel crafted animals which was a quality touch. 
Music in the bar is woeful and is an area that needs improving, play local music not attempts at old English songs that just sound badly dubbed. 
Food was great for the first 5 days then it went rapidly down hill with the menu having inconsistency such as Mexican rice with no Mexican food or no meat available because it needed to have more cooked!
I raised issues with the Manager of Food and Beverage called Nirshana and was very pleasantly surprised that he took all of our concerns onboard and not only fixed them but excelled in carrying out improvements along with inviting us to the Japanese restaurant one night and having a great keema mata made another. Fantastic leader and he is the main reason why this is not a one star review. 
The main problem really was the construction work going on with no notice! Lorries rolling in and delivering huge stones with JCB and crane laying them. Huge booms like bombs and dust all over! Went on for over a week so zero peace and quiet. I spoke to Ashan and Chamodi about the issues but all they wanted to do was give me a suite or something else to appease, I accepted a bottle of wine and my laundry done for free to assist with the inconvenience. They failed to grasp the fact they did not communicate this to anyone not even their own staff. They purely blamed the government but it is not the governments responsibility to inform Hotel guests about building work going on. It is the hotels responsibility to inform our travel company who can inform us as per the ABTA code of conduct for major works. The minister for tourism had visited many weeks before so they knew this was going to happen. 
Absolutely essential they improve in this area as this is key to good customer satisfaction. 
Overall this could be a great place and equal to 5 stars but they need to run a series of improvements to get back to where they should be. 
Recommendations are listen to the guests and don't treat them as commodities but as people, yes it's important to balance cost benefit and customer satisfaction but in the right way such as 10 point NPS.

It is true that gardens became a building site in second week and this overshadowed the excellent Service in the main. There was no warning of the arrival of the JCB’s and Trucks from Management and this was, in my opinion, a serious dereliction of duty.
The resultant dust caused an exacerbation of my asthma symptoms and this absolutely could have been avoided. When I pointed this out to Customer Relations and Management they didn’t seem interested or even willing to offer a satisfactory apology.
I was just glad I wasn’t hospitalised given the conditions, it was a close call.
There was no area cordoned off and trucks were in danger of causing trees to fall over area with sunbathers, it defied belief, the level of incompetence knows no bounds.
Hotel also Managed to lose our room
key (comment from Reception was “let us know if you have lost any valuables”) and spoil our Anniversary Meal (poor experience in A-La-Carte Restaurant), Customer Relations offered very little in compensation, they begrudgingly acknowledged problems but received no proper apology. Management communication on the topic was non-existent, will be pursuing proper compensation through Mercury Travel.","Serious Health Warning","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r950299820-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your feedback and for sharing your concerns regarding the recent disturbances at our hotel. We understand the frustration caused by the erosion of the beach area due to adverse weather conditions.

We want to assure you that we are actively working to address the situation in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Government's Coastal Conservation Department. The measures being implemented aim to protect not only our hotel but also the entire beach area in Katutura. These efforts include reinforcing coastal defenses to mitigate the effects of erosion and safeguard local establishments facing similar challenges.

As discussed during our meeting, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. It's important to note that the erosion resulting from adverse weather conditions is a natural disaster beyond our control. Nevertheless, we take your feedback seriously and are committed to minimizing disruptions in the future.

Your loyalty to our hotel is deeply appreciated

Warm regards,
The Hotel Managment","4032","739895123","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/19/e7/53/caption.jpg","3024","4032","739895122","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/19/e7/52/caption.jpg","3024","1541","739895303","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/19/e8/07/caption.jpg","712","2436","739895906","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/19/ea/62/caption.jpg","1125","2023","739897972","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/19/f2/74/caption.jpg","934",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"De Abrew Road, Kalutara 12000 Sri Lanka","Kalutara","Sri Lanka","12000",,"De Abrew Road","","315693","6.610031","Kalutara, Western Province","79.948364","Royal Palms Beach Hotel","2758","4.5","60","63","146","613","1876","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304136-d315693-Reviews-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html","http://royalpalms.tangerinehotels.com","2024-05-08","OTHER","1","Don’t book this hotel if you don’t want HGVs and JCBs ruining your peaceful holiday ","Value","4","Rooms","4","Location","2","Cleanliness","5","Service","3","Sleep Quality","1","Can you imagine relaxing on your sun lounger when suddenly a constant stream of heavy trucks, JCBs, diggers, diesel fumes, crashing boulders and plumes of dust appear ALL DAY from 7.45 until  8 pm? Just under your balcony waking you up in the morning? The trucks are unloading massive boulders because the sea has encroached on their land. There is NO BEACH. This is not a beach hotel.
The noise and the dust is terrible. It was so bad that the restaurants lowered their plastic blinds to prevent the plumes of dusts entering their building. Huge deafening crashes throughout the day as the trucks unload. Even drove past us while we were eating in the restaurant in the evening ! The noise!! The fumes!

Complained 4 days ago at reception- nothing was done. Emailed- ignored again. Met with management- said they’d get back to us. They didn’t. Eventually spoke to Ashan de Silva and Dharani Sivam. They did not accept ANY responsibility and offered no solution. Could not explain why they had ignored our repeated complaints. They claimed no one else complained. We know of many other guests who are outraged at the disruption and really upset by the constant noise.
They have been ignored too.  Dharni Sivan told us to complain to the Sri Lankan Government! Have you ever heard such nonsense? 

So our honest advice would be not to book this hotel. If something goes wrong the management will not put matters right. Do you want to risk that on your holiday? We stayed here nearly two decades ago and loved it. 

Such a shame that the management now are so unprofessional -  because the pool staff and the waiting on staff are excellent.","Ruined holiday !: Constant JCBs, trucks, diesel fumes, boulders crashing ALL DAY","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r950037880-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Почитал отзывы и увидел что в 2016году был точно такой же случай с воровством.
Кстати как потом узнал от пострадавших отель свою вину отрицает,никакой лояльности не применил.говорят надо все с себя снимать и в сейф убирать.А то что посторонний ползает по территории всем пофигу.

Природа в Шри-Ланке изумительная! Океан красивейший! Главное не торопиться. В отеле красивая, продуманная, ухоженная, большая, территория. Планировка отеля с умом. Расположение номеров, максимально дистанцируют. Вид на море у большинства номеров. Бассейн огонь! И бар там есть и массаж и глубокий бассейн и волейбол и кольцо и лягушатник и даже мелкий заход. Лежаки и полотенца на территории бесплатны. Большинство персонала трудятся на 110%. В столовой имеются ""контролеры"", которые заряжают уставших официантов. Еда, всегда есть что поесть. Есть дни рыбы мяса и т.д. Ресторан при отеле (японский вроде) очень вкусно кормят, но за деньги. Дешёвый трансфер от отеля. Пляж... если сравнивать с Мальдивами то конечно скудный, но для купания в море самое то. Волны огонь! Главное рассчитать силы. Погода огонь! Анимация 3 штуки закольцованные как я понял. Фаер шоу, музыка типа битлз и элвис, и ещё какие-то по бодрее что-то играют. В общем для пенсии или спокойствия. Местные коктели(ром панч, куба либра) и пиво норм. Убирались в номере отлично(првда денег мы тоже норм давали). Теперь о минусах! 1) Работник ресепшена при заселении берет с вас 20$ за заселение в любой номер. 2) Сотрудники бассейна, рано утром занимают лежаки заготовленными книжками шляпами и книгами. Препятствуя людям которые приехали занимать лежаки на которых никого нет.  Видимо для тех кто или заплатил или просто по дружбе. И лежат эти предметы весь день и хорошо если кто-то пришел.3) Еда островатая... 4) Разводилы во всех местах! Начиная от отеля до границы с Индией! Ключевые фразы: ""Where are you from"",""ты откуда"",""смотри крабик"", ""конечно помогу"",""Здраствуйте"",""У меня есть друг в России"" и.т.д. в таком ключе. Все их добро сводиться к разводу на экскурсии или на кидок всего что у вас есть. Все там против вас! Мы для них белые и богатые, а они бедные и несчастные. Что даёт им делать то что недопустимо! Подводя к главной теме которая испортила весь отдых!!!!! 5)!!!Это как нас в номере 206 обнесли пока мы спали! Какой-то чел залез к нам на болкон 2ого этажа и ночью пока мы с женой спали. Украл мое обручальное кольцо, крест с цепочкой, деньги которые были не в сейфе. Коротко: Очень крепко спал так как разница времени. Жена будет в (00:45 примерно по их по нашему +2,5) и говорит, что на балконе шум, до этого там вороны клевали ммдемс который там оставили, я полу проснувшийся полу нет ничего не понимаю. Иду к балкону надевая шорты. Момент что в этот день свет за моим балконом и в проходе номеров не горел! Открываю занавеску и за секунду меня видит вор и прыгает с 2ого этажа и скрывается в темноте... Моё состояние не передать... Этот пассажир выкатил наш чемодан на балкон из номера и там искал хз что ещё.  Шурша пакетиком который мы купили на экскурсии приправ )))) От этого и проснулась жена. Мы позвонили на ресепшен. Я был с другом и его позвал, он был в шоке. Люди с ресепшена что-то записали и сказали что полиция утром приедет. Утром никто не приехал и мы сами поехали в полицию. Там нас выслушали или сделали вид. Потом полицейский с нами и работниками отеля приехал в отель. Мы попили смузи )) и ещё раз все рассказали... непонятно зачем? И только после нашей просьбы полицейские прошли в наш номер. И там они ничего не увидели. В камеры которые стоят в мёртвой зоне! Как раз под нашим балконом и проходом за территорию отеля ничего невидно. Мы пробовали доказать работникам отеля как вор мог убежать и даже показали так что-бы камеры не видели. Но работники отеля нам так и не помогли. Ссылаясь, что полиция всё проверила! Точнее тот дядька, который пил смузи и делал вид важного. И постоянно работники отеля и генералиссимус говорили, что кольцо которое ты снял должен класть в сейф даже если спишь рядом с ним. Вы серьёзно? А чемодан как туда положить? Спали мы потом с баррикадами на всякий. Фото и камер и проход выложу. По итогу я бы хотел предостеречь всех! От таки-же ситуаций. Всегда всё держите в сейфе! И будьте на чеку! Даже в 5 звёздочном отеле вы не застрахованы от такого. Это ещё хорошо что моя жена говорила на английским! Так бы работники отеля просто смеялись в лицо, как делали нам на слова что нас могли и убить! Кто знает кто залез к нам и какие мысли у него были. Я бы с радостью переиграл эту ситуацию... но что было то было. Будьте бдительны даже на отдыхе. Всем х��рошего отдыха! Спасибо за понимание.

First of all the wifi does not work well at all. It works for a bit at times, but then disconnects itself and when you try to reconnect it takes about 40 minutes to connect. There is also a loud train that drives by right next to the hotel which woke us up several times throughout the nights which I understand is not the hotels fault, but just something to keep in mind if you’re considering staying here. The first day we had dinner in the buffet and we ate some chicken that was a bit pink but didn’t think much of it because sometimes you see pink near the bone, but the next day my dad was throwing up badly and I had never seen him sick like that before. My mum and I both had gotten diarrhoea and it just completely ruined the visit.  Then in the middle of the night we found a mouse eating our chocolate bar. The next day we were laying by the pool and the sun beds have handles that stick out the end of the beds which my mum tripped over and fell. The people next to us were very friendly and helped her out but it is not a good design, I am now writing this review 2 weeks later and her hands are still sensitive to put pressure on. Other than that, the workers are very friendly and they were always so kind to us.

If you are travelling with a guest with special needs or disability. Reconsider the hotel ",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately I have to say that this hotel needs a good refurbishment and not sure how it has maintained a 5 star status.

The family stayed here for 5 days throug 31 Dec 2021.

The main reason that I have given 3 stars is due to the amazing service by the waiting staff... Special mention to Dhanushka and Sanjeewa who look after the buffet restaurant meals.

It's a good hotel, in a great location.. Just requires some maintenance and better management. 
The NYE dance and arrangement was fantastic. 

Just some notes on what you can do to improve:

1) management - The manager (Thushara) at the restaurant is extremely abrupt in the way he speaks to guests and is very disrespectful in the manner which he speaks to the other staff in front of guests. No one deserves to be spoken to like that.

2) Food: The food has been very good. However, on the 1st of January (today) the buffet had left over food from lunch or previous day. Some of the starters, deserts and mainly the Pineapple curry was bad. I returned this to the waiting staff.

3) Cleanliness: Restaurant needs better flooring.  Always sticky and slippery. Specially the buffet area and the dessert area. 

4) Not abilities friendly: One person in my family has a disability and finds it hard to use the stairs. There is no easy was to get to the restaurant. No lift or ramp for a wheelchair / walking stick. You are forced to take the long route around the pool. 

No lighting and walking in darkness on an uneven surface and it's a much longer route. 
No shelter from the rain. 
Not good enough as it makes the persons life much harder.

In the rooms - There is only a bathtub with a half glass. The person with the disability is unable to use the showers. They simply cannot get into a bathtub and the half glass hinders any support that can be provided. 

5) Rooms: Rooms were having a damp smell and dusty.  Guessing this was due to no guests as a result of covid. However was good after the first room clean. The kettle in the room had a hole and was leaking, directly to the powerboard in the cupboard. 

6) Room toilets: Old plumbing that does no work well and is noisy when used. Needs maintenance desperately. And a reminder that the bathtub as the only option for a shower is inconvenient and does not help my family with disability or older guests. 

7) Animals on premises: There are stray dogs and cats on premises. The security runs behind them with a cane to hit them... Re think how you treat animals,. There are kids that feed the animals, only to see them getting chased and beaten??","Good hotel that desperately needs a refurbished and better management ","2022-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r823622688-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Because we wanted to see most of the tourist attractions (all of them are far from the hotel but we knew that beforehand) we only treated the hotel as an accommodation. Hotel was ok, staff was very friendly although we were leaving a large tips. What we have noticed it's a lot of very poorly, infected cats around the dining area and pool. And we are aware that due to the religion they can not be look after but so many of them being sick and in the hotel premises is appealing. I have few photos of them but they are heartbreaking. Second thing is I left the winter coat in the hotel. I was in a hurry. It;s not a big deal- I've paid for that coat about 120 Euroes a week before that holiday and because I travel often (I've been in Sri Lanka twice since my visit) I could easly pick it up. I've realised that I left coat in the hotel during the transfer jurney from the hotel to the airport and the person- as my understanding is representative of the hotel promised it will get deliver to me as it's hotels fault that the person who came at the same time we were leaving haven't realised the missing item was left behind. Hotel response was that they found it but they have no car to arrange that 10 min. transport (as that far we were at the time from the hotel). I exchanged several messages with that person- hotel representative responsible to get us safe to the airport who was assuring me I'll receive coat back. I never did, instead I received several inappropriate messages from the same person which had nothing to do with the coat. As I mentioned before I could pick up coat easly after as I was in Sri Lanka twice since but noone responded to any of the email I've sent. I thought maybe I have the wrong email address but Tui confirmed its correct. It's a shame as I travel very often- visited over 40 countries; stayed in over 1000 hotels and I've never experienced such an ignorance and incompetence.
I almost forgot in order to reserve sunbed you have to get up at 5am unless you pay the staff to do it for you. Staff reserve them as soon as they start work so they can make extra money- for the 5 star hotels it's not only inappropriate but 
unprofessional too.","I definitely won't be staying in Royal Palms Beach Hotel again","2019-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d315693-r747586953-Royal_Palms_Beach_Hotel-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The issues began even before we checked in. When we called ahead to confirm if there was accommodation for our private driver (a common courtesy in Sri Lanka), the staff assured us there was. However, upon arrival, we discovered this was not the case. Our driver had to find his own accommodation last minute, which could have been avoided if they had been honest from the start.

The room itself was disappointing. The towels were stained, and the toiletries looked old and unpresentable. While I want to believe the towels were clean despite the stains, it left the impression that the hotel prioritizes cost-cutting over delivering a quality guest experience.

The most frustrating issue was the lack of hot water. After a long day, we were too exhausted to address it and resorted to cold showers. When we raised this with the duty manager the next day, another guest overheard and echoed the same complaint. The manager explained their water heating system is solar-powered and offered to turn on a backup generator, but the hot water remained inconsistent throughout our stay.

To be fair, the service staff were respectful and prompt, which we appreciated. However, this didn’t make up for the lack of basic amenities or the feeling that guest comfort is not the hotel’s priority.

Overall, I cannot recommend Seerock. Between the misleading communication, subpar room standards, and functional shortcomings, this was a deeply disappointing experience.","No hot water and dirty towels","2024-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r986662344-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

There was no place to take nice pictures even. They’ve ample place but not maintained properly. Landscaping is nil. Also horrible wifi

There was actually nothing to choose from. Menu needs to change and also only the local food was okay. Other than that pastas was horrible. I had a spaghetti bolognese and it was not a bolognese at all. They just served me noodles with beef and tomato slices 🤦🏾‍♂️ 

The worst thing is we booked the hotel on full board through another app with a discount. The management refused to serve us English breakfast because we booked it on a discount. It was not mentioned anywhere at all. Also it’s very poor to treat different customers in a different way.

We thank you for your patronage. However ,
We are surprised to see your comments about a loss of an iPad and money. We understand that you have stayed two days at a different place or places after leaving our hotel to find that your iPad is missing. You confirmed your money was kept in the safety locker but some in your bag which is missing. 
Therefore your claim is totally unacceptable and it is done purposely to tarnish the reputation of the hotel. We have reported your review. 
We also wish to state that this is the first time someone complain about any loss of valuables in our hotel since of opening for business in 2017.
On the contrary hotel management had just returned, two days before your departure, some passports and wallet to the next hotel of another guest who had left behind in the hotel when they left. That is how honest our staff is.
We also learned from your driver that your refusal to pay his expenses incured during the stay had made you to make this false complain.
Therefore we totally reject your complain.
Thank you.

There were 2 male cleaners who were cleaning the rooms. Just saying.
I emailed the manager 2 days later when I found out the items were missing and they couldn’t do anything about. They said that 2 days later was a long time after the departure. Really? I am on holiday and busy discovering places, I don’t have time to use my iPad every day.

Upon check out, the manager asked me to pay additional 2000Rupes for the driver’s accommodation which of course I refused to pay. Shocking. My driver had to step in and argue with the manager as this was going nowhere. Even the driver promised not to bring any tourist in that place by the way he was treated.

I was told that the food could be brought to the room at an additional charge of Rs 1000 each meal! There was no pool attendant and the shower and water feature at the pool did not work. There was no way to communicate with the staff from the room. No phone. We were given a daily menu with 3 choices for each meal. There was no a la carte menu.

Your comments were received and apologize if you had any such difficulties in making a reservation. We understand you have purchased a voucher through a different platform and since it is a very special rate given to that particular promotion we have a limited rooms allocated and if the category of rooms not available on a particular day that does not mean value and location is poor.

I called the hotel and checked their availability and placed a temporary booking. Then I confirmed the offer and made the payment and requested them to send the booking confirmation. 

I had been trying for 3 days to get a booking confirmation from them!!! But still had NO success. I travel a quite a lot and sending a booking confirmation is a matter of few minutes usually. I was surprised why it is taking them days to send a simple booking confirmation. I have made more than 10 calls over the past 3 days to ask for the booking. Also, to my surprise I found that the last few calls made to the landline were intentionally picked up and cancelled. (This is a FIRST in many of my travels).

Also, I had the feeling that the first female agent who picked up the reservation was clueless. She was not good in her English, so I spoke to her in Sinhalese. Whenever I inquired about the booking she will reply saying it will be sent shortly. But it never came in the first 3 days. What a waste of time!

Finally on the fourth day another reservation executive picks up the call and sends me a booking for a different set of days. I tried to call and ask them to correct it. But the hotel never picked up any of their phones.

So i finally decided to cancel the booking. 
I'm sure they have made a Blunder somewhere!!!
hence this reaction! 
I have seen hotels make mistakes before but the quality hotels always try to make amends and will usually try to check with the customer and correct it. This is a good sign of the lack of quality and lack of training of the staff.

Greetings from the Seerock The Kings Domain Sigiriya Sri Lanka!

The management is indeed very sorry to hear about your experience thought very unusual at the most popular well received about Seerock Boutique Hotel.
We appreciate all feedback positive and negative as it helps us to understand customers likes and dislikes about our business and customer satisfaction status for appropriate follow-ups.

1. We understand that you were not happy about the access road to the village. 'Hotel is situated in the Ancient cultural triangle in the rural village setting surrounded by the jungle in Sigiriya! Most of our guests value this experience as it is different from usual.
2.Rate: Booking via hotels in December 2018  on season rate applied differs from OTA rates in Feb 2019. The rates in similar properties in the area at the same period is much higher. And the rates include 30% of it as Tax and SC which the management is compelled to charge from the guests.
3. Value: The management did some changes to wave off all extra bills Amounting to US Doller 142/-  And we offered a complimentary stay for another additional day Full Board and also at his next visit to Sri Lanka. we started to extend the same! To compensate your dissatisfaction about the rate to add further value. 
We invited you back providing us the opportunity to exceed expectation in the best traditions of hospitality at the Seerock ""The Kings Domain"" Sigiriya.
Please accept our renewed thanks and appreciation for your valued patronage and we trust that you will be back with us to serve you diligently as our valued guest.

It’s really surprising reading all these positive reviews when this is a hotel that charges 5 star prices but is 3 star at best. 

Entry to the hotel is via a bumpy and dusty dirt road. 

The power kept cutting in and out during our stay. 

The menu is a lucky dip because it’s only after you order that they tell you things are not available. 

Some staff, although friendly, don’t have adequate English skills which at a hotel charging such prices that is supposed to cater for international guests is not appropriate. It should not take 3 different staff members and 10 minutes of gesturing to communicate a request for some toast. 

The place is full of mosquitoes which means unless you douse yourself in bug spray each night you can’t actually enjoy the lounge or dinner at the restaurant. One night we had the door open for about 30 seconds and that was enough for me to wake up with several large mosquito bites (see photos) despite having the mosquito net over the bed! 

We were very clear with our complaints to the manager and he did make some changes such as adding incense to the dining area to reduce the mosquitoes but that meant you’re eating with smoke coming over your food!

We told him we really don’t see how the hotel has the audacity to charge 59,000lkr per night especially when we only saw two other couples during our 3 day stay and a couple of weeks later the rate was around 29,000lkr per night. 

He said that because we booked via hotels.com he couldn’t do anything which isn’t true since we have friends who own hotels. 

He did credit our food bill for our stay which was about 17,000lkr. 

We have stayed at many places throughout the world ranging from B&Bs to high end hotels but never have we felt so ripped off in terms of value!

Yes the service is good but service is good everywhere in Sri Lanka so it’s nothin unique to this hotel. 

We do agree that the food is very delicious compared to other places but even their prices (cheap for western standards) are out of proportion to the other 5 star hotels we stayed at.

We would have given this a really high rating had the rate been about 30,000lkr because it definitely did not deliver on its price tag. If you can book for about this price then definitely stay here but dont get ripped off and pay anymore.

The location is very nice considering there are many wild birds and monkeys around in the trees.

We had a superior deluxe room which include a jacuzzi tub in the room. The room is very big with a very comfortable bed, and a high and interesting roof. It has acces to two patios one in the front and one in the back, both of patios had chairs and one of them had a table. There is no free minibar.

To go from your room to the restaurant / reception you need a lantern which was also provided in the room.

After we took a bath in the jacuzzi, we ended up without hot water, so we had to wash ourselves with almost cold water.

We had dinner at the restaurant, and we had to wait more than one hour for a club sandwich and a burger. The food was not fantastic but the service was terrible, considering that other clients that got to dinner after us, were served sooner even though they also had similar food (burger and pasta). We then had to wait almost another hour for the bill; we received two bills, one in USD for food and one in SRK (rupees) for the beverages. We wanted to pay both bills in local currencies but the final bill was not received and we had to go the bar and ask again for the bill so we can pay it. 

We thought this was an isolated case but it proves we were wrong when at next morning breakfast the service was the same.

For breakfast there is a menu with only two or three menus for breakfast out of which you have to chose one. So we ordered two portion of fresh fruits, 2 glasses of fresh juice, tea, jam, butter and bread. 

When the waiter came he decided we can both have only one portion of jam, butter and bread. The fruit plate had very few pieces of fruits (a banana cut in half ? wtf ? a bite of pineaple, a bite of watermelon and a bite of papaya).
We felt like we were two people having a one person breakfast, and the breakfast and the service was so bad it just made us feel like we received the breakfast for free, though we had a DELUXE SUPERIOR ROOM with BREAKFAST INCLUDED.

We do not recommend at all this place because of the service and the very bad food.","AWFUL service, nice location, nice room","2018-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d10903452-r571740194-Seerock_the_King_s_Domain-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

It is with great remorse that we note the inconvenience undergone by you.  
As conveyed to you upon our previous conversation the complaint pertaining to the quality of the cake was lodged more than  a  day  after collection as such we were not in a position to  conclusively determine how these circumstances arouse.  Temperature fluctuations can lead to discoloration and the formation of mould, which we believe to be the likely cause in this instance. 		
As conveyed to you ,  the cake had been inspected for quality and found to be in good condition prior to its release for delivery and all cakes at our outlets are stored in chillers until collection.   Instructions pertaining to storage and consumption accompany our meals and cakes for convenience of our patrons.
It is a prime and consistent endeavor on our part to conform to the highest quality standards for all our products.
 We trust you understand our position in this matter

The strawberries on top were moldy, which is completely unacceptable—especially from a brand with such a strong reputation in Sri Lanka.

This cake was a gift for someone very special, and I was honestly embarrassed when she pointed out the spoiled fruit. I placed the order 4 days in advance, trusting in their quality and standards.

After I raised a complaint, the staff member I spoke to tried to defend the brand by giving false explanations, insisting that it wasn’t their fault. She wasn’t unprofessional in her manner, but she clearly gave misleading information to protect the hotel's name—without understanding how their own online ordering system works or even acknowledging the timing of my purchase. None of what she said aligned with the facts. It felt like they were just trying to push the blame onto me rather than taking any responsibility.

So please be cautious if you're buying food from this hotel. In my experience, they do not genuinely consider the customer's side—they only defend their position, no matter what happens to you.

There were lots of mosquitos due to the river which the hotel can’t control, but it would have been useful to have mosquito nets round the bed.

The hotel is extremely unhygienic, and the food is poorly cooked. The buffet timings are inconvenient; for example, breakfast ends at 9 a.m., which is problematic if we wake up late and miss it. Dinner also ends too early, and the buffet area floor is not clean.

We found many insects in the food, especially around the juice section.

The condition of the rooms is very bad. The furniture is worn out, the televisions are outdated, and the windows are difficult to open.

The bathroom has many sharp corners and edges, which can be dangerous. The drawers in the closets fall out when opened.

The service is terrible. When you order food, it arrives cold, and phone responses are slow.

The reception staff is unprofessional. They deceived us when we requested a better room. They fulfilled our request but later charged us an additional $200 per night without informing us beforehand.

I strongly discourage you from visiting this hotel. The management is neither respectful nor friendly, and they only care about taking your money without providing proper service. Please do not visit this hotel.

g) Attitude from reception that’s the best we can offer because all rooms are booked.
I stated clearly room is totally unhygienic and the room is not acceptable.
h) We also made the decision to leave the hotel in the evening due to your poor care for customers, we sat outside for nearly 2 hours and then when we were leaving 2-3 reception ladies and a manager came to us to offer food/platter in our room, but they can’t change the room, what an insult after 2 hours nobody cared only when we left you decided to show concern.

The Hotel is 5 Star but as a customer from listed above points your rating should be maximum 3 Star, similar comments to the ones above are already on trip advisor, these are factual comments.

There are far superior hotels and similar cost in the area, I advise you to look at other hotels before you spend such cost.

Hotel will for sure have there comments, but in the end money is hard earned for holidays, so please read carefully the issues I faced on our holiday.

Maybe the reason is we are on a package trip, but nevertheless why I should accept these standards.

Our check in with welcome drink and cool towel was good but reception decor was looking cheap with plastic flowers.

Bathroom was small and The bathtub in bathroom was unnecessary as it was small and not convenient to take shower which again not expected from 5 star property.Room has unwanted big wall mirrors but tiny TV which again not expected from 5 star property.The spa couldn’t be experienced as there was only therapist who busy throughout. The bar area was not ergonomically located and had uncomfortable big furniture which was not polished at all made the hotel look old.The only saving grace is restaurant which has huge variety in dinner and breakfast buffet with great staff Ms Anjali,Mr Kevin,Ms Nadeesha,Mr Indika who took good care of us and that’s why 2 stars.

I’m not sure of why the other reviews are so high. We stayed here for 2 nights and honestly couldn’t wait to leave! 
Cons:
- as mentioned earlier, it’s not a five star hotel. We had chosen since it’s advertised as five star.  In this same trip I have stayed at the Fullerton (Singapore), followed by Cinnamon Grand (Colombo), Jetwing Galle and Jetwing Yala. So I’m comparing based on rates. The room rate was cheaper- should have known!
- Rooms are old and dated- after we had checked out we found that only the 2nd and 3rd floors were renovated. So don’t stay on the first floor rooms- ours was old dated, mold everywhere in the shower, just looked unclean. Rugs had a terrible smell, unclean with stains. 
- Bedding: grey, felt wet and there was dirt- hair and lint under the covers that I had to remove before sleeping. We didn’t complain only because we were tired from our trip, it was late and just wanted to get to bed. 
- Other clientele ( from two of the most populous countries) - I get it that this is expected of any hotel and it’s not the hotel’s fault. Our experience was so bad that I have to mention that these tourists were in large groups, were rude at staff, obnoxious, loud (literally yelling wherever they were), kids running around uncontrolled by their parents and lacked any etiquette during the meal times. Basically they owned the place, you couldn’t get to your food at the buffet, as they would be having their group conversations at the buffet and some would pick foods with their hands. Avoid if this bothers you about other clientele. 
- Food was mediocre, basic at best, staff couldn’t keep up with requests. Always long queue at the buffet and as mentioned with the large groups it’s a battle. One of the nights we dined outside at a nearby (walking distance) restaurant called Flower Drum- went there on recommendation by our driver and it was great- authentic Chinese food at very reasonable prices. 
Pros:
- Staff- they do their best, they are attentive and friendly, we found only a handful  understand  and able to speak. 
- the surrounds (lake) and pool - great and is the only thing I enjoyed of this hotel.","2 Star at best","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r934732430-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The king size bed is essentially two beds joined together - so effectively the middle is a no go zone . 

However,  the worst part of the hotel is the substandard food on offer . Breakfast is a joke. The cooking stations might as well not exist as there is hardly any service given when your in front (this maybe partly due to the number of rude Indian families that frequent the hotel). The hopper station quality was so bad that I was shocked when I was served which essentially is a raw hopper (see pics) .

From the moment we arrived, we were taken aback by the hotel’s appearance. The property looked cheap, and the reception area was sparse and scattered. Although the front desk reception was warm and helpful, and we did receive a property tour, our experience quickly deteriorated.

We were placed in a room far from the main reception area, down a dark and dingy corridor that felt very unsafe. The security presence on the property was minimal, and we did not feel secure. The room itself was very basic, lacking the amenities one would expect from a five-star hotel. There were no bedroom slippers, gowns, or other basic comforts. The beds were rock hard and extremely uncomfortable, with not even a carpet on the floor. The couch was dirty and literally falling apart, making the room feel more like a dormitory than a supposed five-star hotel. Additionally, the bathroom blinds did not work.

The main dining area was chaotic, with basic meals and no order in terms of serving and setting. The dining area was clearly unequipped to handle the busy season, and my children were uncomfortable as they were pushed around by adults in the chaos. The residents of the hotel were extremely rowdy, with doors banging, people shouting through the night, and loud club-style music playing. We could even hear furniture being moved, which made for an unsavoury experience.

When we alerted the reception about these issues, they said it was out of their control and only offered to move us to a room closer to reception in the middle of the night, while my children were already trying to fall asleep. We were deeply unhappy with the hotel, its facilities, and the type of guests it attracts. Consequently, we packed up and left the very next morning.

This experience was far from what we expected, and we are extremely disappointed. We hope that these observations and suggestions will help improve the experience for future guests.","Profoundly Disappointing Stay at Amaya Beach Resort","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r992262074-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Минусы
Очень слабый интернет, днем на пляже в принципе видео сложно грузятся, работать также не получается.  Если решите поработать с ноутбуком днем, вряд ли получится.
2. Еда относительно разнообразная, но почти все острое. Причем в ценник они включают еще Taxe Fri и чаевые. На местные деньги выходит 5500 ланкийских. Это без напитков. Пиво в районе 600 плюс 30 процентов различных сборов. 
Покупая вино в баре на пляже, мы получили пару бокалов красного сухого вина, 30 градусной температуры. Очень необычно. 
3. Бассейн - реальная глубина от 50 см до 1 метра. То есть это просто широкая ванная для детей.
4. Самый главный минус отеля это отсутствие развлечений.
Аниматоров нет. Собрать команду для волейбола сложно.
Водные виды спорта в реальности отсутствуют.  
Йоги нет.

We checked out after 2 and went to Uga Bay which is 3 times the price but a 10 times better experience. I’m very surprised to see so many people calling this place “luxury” or “high end”, it’s really not. The reality does not match their website descriptions or photos. I just found the whole place quite depressing.

First, the positives - our room was excellent. Spacious, loads of room for luggage and storage, effective AC and a nice balcony.

Housekeeping is very efficient and friendly, as are the reception staff. Sadly, we felt that the communal areas, bar staff and some of the food really lets the hotel down. 

Our biggest issue is that we wanted to spend most of our time during this part of our holiday (a 2 week tour of Sri Lanka) in the pool and/or the sea/beach. Both of these areas at Amaya are frankly a disgrace. The pool is filthy, it has a greasy, grimy ring around the whole of the edge and there are living insects (water fleas?) in it. If the proper chlorine levels are applied and cleanliness standards adhered to, there should be no living creatures in a swimming pool! 

The beach has clearly been man made using sand bags made of plastic, which are now eroding away into the ocean, causing devastating pollution of the hotel’s own making. The lack of any attempt or effort to clean the swimming pool and sort out the plastic sandbags on the beach speaks to the general feeling of a lack of care from staff. 

Crows are clearly present all along this part of the coast, however there were far more here than at Uga Bay and would hazard a guess that it’s because they actually clear away dirty plates and glasses there quickly, unlike here! Crows are extremely clever birds and have obviously learned that they can have a feast at Amaya Beach. As someone has said, they are constantly drinking from the pool water and leaving droppings everywhere. 

The service in the bar area is woeful. Dirty glasses and dishes sat for a long time whilst staff watched cricket on tv. See photo attached of dirty glasses that were left in the hotel grounds overnight and for the whole of the next day - several staff walked past these many times. Staff at the bar were unfriendly and lazy. Reactive, never proactive - the onus is on the customer for everything, even getting their own bill. Had to go to bar every time you want something. To have a 10% service charge added to each bill here is an insult.

You have to beg for towels and when we first arrived he said there are “none left”… “you wait 20 mins”. There is a full time pool attendant who not once got sun lounger cushions out - all guests lay on hard rattan sun loungers that were falling apart. We got some cushions from a filthy looking pile by side of hotel - the pool guy came over and said these were old and that if we waited 2 hours the new ones would be ready…well of course they never materialised. Why is the onus on the paying customer to return towels? There were two staff by the towel bin doing literally nothing but kick a ball around.

Dining experience is not great (hot, very busy) and food quality overall is poor. All meat dishes have bones in them - the lamb curry last night even contained liver. Limited choice and some foods incorrectly labelled eg pasta puttanesca was a creamy pasta. Salad and fruit offerings at breakfast were clearly leftovers from night before. The exception was the egg bar at breakfast- the eggs and omelettes were very good. 

I feel bad for the lovely staff who put effort into their jobs here - they are being let down by poor management who quite frankly should be addressing the issues I’ve highlighted. Our tour operator told the management team of our plans to leave early, however when we checked out the following day the reception staff had no idea - they had not been told. The fact that family is checking out early because they are not happy tells you all you need to know about management’s attitude to customer service.","All the positives are sadly outweighed by the negatives","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r960425360-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

We reached the hotel midday 13th April after 8 hours of journey & absolutely no welcome at all, we thought they might offer some welcome drinks & some towel but nothing came we went to the bar and ordered some juices. Entire staff under trained and absolutely no respect/response to the customers because their not trained at all, the restaurant cannot accommodate large number of guests so you may have to wait until someone finishes to get a seat because so many walking customers and they get the preference as they know the staff and tables were not clean, table mats are dirty too. We book two rooms the executive suit 2112 but outside, garden lights not working, fridge not working we stayed 3 nights but they didn’t attend to it. 
Breakfast & dinner buffet is good but not 4star for sure maximum 3 star. I suggest the executive chef to do food tasting before they put to buffet.
Hopper making guy takes long time to make an egg hopper again untrained staff. 
If you want to order hopper or omelette you may have to stand and wait for long time. 
This hotel situated next to the biggest public beach in eastern province and the whole beach is packed every day with locals and it’s so dirty too. Beach in front of this hotel is beautiful but you can’t bath because full of Corel’s the only area you can bath completely Conquered by the local people be careful with your belongings. 
New year day 14th April, we thought they will keep some sweets like kavum, kokis, aasmi, aluwa for breakfast but nothing at all. first time in my life in a hotel that they didn’t serve new year goodies to the guest on new year day.
Staff will always staring at you if you order anything maybe staff not happy. 
Only room service staff and some staff members at the bar is going a good job. Rooms are spacious But basic amenities are not their toothbrushes, toothpaste, bathrobes, slippers etc..
Towels are pretty old, if you’re going to pool/beach you need to go to the pool attendant and beg for towel then you must return and mark the book otherwise you may have to pay for the towels.
Entire staff including the top management need to learn the hospitality industry & check how others properties in your chain handling the new year day and beyond. I asked for a glass of water at breakfast on 14th April from few nobody gave then I went to take a juice then no glasses 🥲.

The worst Hotel in Sri -Lanka!

We had our worst experience today(11.12.2023). Our family booked 02 rooms in this property through Booking.com, and we had prepaid. However when we showed at the property they were clue less about our booking. Even when we showed our booking reference they were not able to trace our booking.
I can understand, if this is was booked through any other site, can be an excuse. But how come Booking.com mislead, as per resort, booking has been taken over by another agent.  
Am the guest, when I book through booking.com, I don’t care with whom they have partnered. It’s totally irrelevant to me. I book and I paid, it’s simple theory. 
We arrived to the property 13:30hrs, and they kept us waiting 2hours in the lobby with poor decision making management. Simply Front office has no experience at all they were all busy on there phones.  
The front office manager roaming around with no clue, very disappointed to see there professionalism.  Finally we lost our money for stay which we didn’t use. 
How to handle the issue, you could have give us the rooms, and for sure you will receive booking request through the agent day after.

Note that, word of mouth is very power tool. I would use it at every inch. 
Once again you are the worst hotel in Sri Lanka. Scammers!!!!!","Worst Front office Staff","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d4198494-r929165689-Amaya_Beach_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

But the good things end there.  The food service at the restaurant is below average, there is no service, we literealy have to ask for everything like napkins, water etc. We have booked a beach barbecue party which they reuined beyond words because the food was below average.  This dinner was supposed to be our highlight of the week long trip.  We have complained to the restaurant manager but it looks like its fallen on deaf ears.  We also stayed at Amaya Hills-Kandy and Amaya Lake-Dumbulla, they were doing an excellent job in every department and its puzziling to me that Amaya Beach-Pasikudah can get away with bad service while being a part this chain.

When we checked in, we did not even get a welcome drink. We were very tired after the long journey. Had been to many hotels before , but this was the first time we got a welcome like this.
