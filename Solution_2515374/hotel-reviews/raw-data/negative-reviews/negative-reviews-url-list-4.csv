We are also sorry you did not like our rooms but guess everyone has different tastes, you were really lucky we could accommodate you at all as you booked for 2 double rooms (2 double beds) and turned up with 7 persons which gave us a small problem, so we had to shuffle our rooms that we had all ready allocated to other guest.
you mention you had to pay for food at the hotel your breakfast was not included in the room rate with the online agent  you booked with and I gave that complimentary, all guest have to pay for lunch and dinner, we are not an all inclusive result.
we are glad you liked the restaurant and staff. I would suggest you really look where you are booking and look at the location and bring the correct number of people you book for to save you and the hotel any problems in the future.

1) The interiors are extremely old with the room decor very tacky.
2) This is far from the beach... why would one go to a beach area and not stay near a beach specially when there are quite a few hotels near the beach.

I don't understand how this is rated so high in trip advisor (I chose this because of trip advisor ratings which i believe in).  Maybe I completely missed something.

The other hotels in Sri Lanka were top notch interiors and great locations at similar USD 100+ price points.  For the price it is an extremely poor deal specially when you are on a vacation and expect to stay in a better place than your apartment :-)

That said- the staff is very friendly and helpful... the small restaurant is great (but you pay for it separately).

Both of the owners are nice people, chatty and kind. Similarly the staff are also nice and well meaning and the restaurant makes a good curry but this hotel was not for us.

We stayed in Jasmine which was meant to be a luxury suite. The main feature is a big bathtub which overlooks the river. However the bath was very stained ( looked like muddy paw prints all over) and wasn't inviting so we didn't use it. On our second night we returned and found droppings in the bathroom - I assume it was gecko droppings but still not pleasant, however unsurprising considering the bathroom windows had an open gap between them.

Speaking of gaps, our bedroom door did not close properly. Yes we could lock it but there was a gap between the wood door and doorframe - if you walked past you could peep in, I didn't like that and noticed it with other rooms also.

Design and furniture is old and heavy wood which I wouldn't mind if the room was in good condition. I didn't like to see a stained wall from brown water marks or damp or whatever it was. Also our mosquito net had holes and stains on it.

Lastly the location, nowhere near anything by foot and not possible to go for a stroll either; rubble roads and litter around the perimeters.

Upon booking this hotel we relied heavily onTripadvisor and felt let down.","Not for us...","2015-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1009523-r256558853-Asian_Jewel_Boutique_Hotel-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It`s our first totally negative review in 5 years, so we must take the negatives and turn them into positives, i can only answer the points you have raised. I have also spoken to the room boy and housekeeping, I think this must have been an Isolated  incident, as we have had another review which is very  positive and they stayed after you in the same room, and stayed longer than the 1 day in which you had booked.
Baddegama Road is indeed very dusty, and undergoing major road works linking it with the Highway, as for the noise we are on Field View, Lane 3 which is a fair distance from Baddegama Road and there is minimal traffic noise. it over looks the lake and is on a dead end.
There are an estimated 2 million stray dogs in Sri Lanka and unfortunately we can not help this as a hotel, its more a Government issue. We do have a dog on site, you will see her mentioned in many reviews, she was also a stray that we rescued from 2 weeks old  and as you said she is very fat, but not pregnant as she is now 11, and very friendly. We also have a hotel cat which is also a rescue cat and we are sorry this caused  you concern.
The Bath is slightly stained from a guest using cinnamon oil and we are waiting for a specialist to recoat it, and I am having to source the spray from the UK as its not available in Sri Lanka but it is still clean, again we apologise for this.
You mentioned rodent droppings , when i showed you the room and checked before you arrived  the room was spotless, what you saw were gecko droppings and no matter how much anybody who lives in Asia will know, you can never keep a room or any place completely gecko free, again I apologise for this but its very difficult.
You mentioned the towels are a little tired, we are not sure why as we just replaced all the towels in January including pool and room towels,

we will take everything you said on board and  we are sorry our hotel did not meet your  standards,

Unfortunately disappointed.  The road from Hikkaduwa to the hotel is dusty and noisy and there are road-works being carried out (although not the fault of the hotel).  There are lots of stray dogs outside and there appeared to be a fat or pregnant one in the eating area.  The bathroom was not clean; the bathtub had what looked like varnish stains on it (did not feel like using it), and found what looked like rodent droppings on the bathroom window.  Towels looked tired.  There was no telephone in the room and did not use the pool (a stray cat was seen drinking from it).  However, wifi was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and are the best feature of this hotel.  Tanya and Dale were pleasant and helpful.  The food was okay, and breakfast was good. The views over the lake are great but when you go to the lake edge it is quite littered. The impression created by the previous reviews (based on which the booking was made) did not match the experience or expectation of a 'boutique' hotel.","Lovely staff, but did not meet expectations","2014-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1009523-r194716928-Asian_Jewel_Boutique_Hotel-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

	1.	We did not “change our minds.” We raised concerns before arrival.
We contacted Booking.com before arriving to request a cancellation waiver due to concerning recent reviews on Google. These were not isolated incidents, and many described exactly what we later saw ourselves: a worn-down, poorly maintained hotel far from what the photos suggest. Several of those reviews have since been reported and removed, just like the hotel tried to do with ours. This pattern of review suppression speaks volumes.
	2.	We were asked to lie in writing.
After we arrived, saw the condition of the hotel, and decided to leave, we were asked by hotel management to submit a written statement claiming we had changed our travel plans in order to be considered for a refund. That was completely untrue. We did not change our plans — we stayed in Trincomalee as planned and booked a new hotel 10 minutes before checking in, as shown clearly in our Booking.com account history. We have a recorded phone call in which this demand is made, and we have submitted this recording, along with all written correspondence, to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
	3.	The core issue is value and misrepresentation.
This property is priced like a luxury resort but does not meet that standard! The photos online are outdated and misleading. In reality, the hotel is old, visibly run-down, and poorly maintained. After traveling across Sri Lanka and staying in several more affordable places, it was shocking to find this was the most expensive and least impressive of all.
	4.	We have documented everything.
Every part of our experience — the false refund condition, the misleading photos, and the lack of cooperation — is backed by evidence: recordings, whatsapp communication, booking timestamps, and photographs. We have formally reported the hotel and submitted all materials to Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Let this also be a warning to not book with Booking.com (check their google rating reviews) since Booking.com has said they cannot assist! 

We stand fully by our review. It reflects a documented experience — not opinion, and certainly not defamation.

What we found on arrival was shocking: a severely outdated, run-down property that bore no resemblance to the photos or description. It was a massive letdown — especially given the price. Hostels and backpacker lodges in the area were in better shape and cost a fraction of the rate.

Before arrival, we became concerned after locals and recent online reviews raised red flags. On arrival, our concerns were confirmed — and we immediately expressed that we weren’t comfortable staying. Management’s response was dismissive, at times aggressive, and entirely unprofessional. Instead of addressing the issues, they insisted on keeping the full payment under the pretense of a “non-refundable” policy — regardless of the false advertising.

Worse still, we were asked to submit a written statement falsely claiming we changed our travel plans — something we refused to do out of principle. This was apparently required to “consider” a refund. We chose not to play along with that narrative and escalated the case to Booking.com.

We travel extensively and are always willing to pay for quality. This was not quality. This was a bait-and-switch disguised as a luxury resort. Avoid at all costs.","⭐ 0-Star: Severely Misrepresented and Managed with Arrogance","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1010190338-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We deeply regret that your stay did not meet your expectations. Please allow us to address the points you raised -
 
Positives:
We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed the outdoor space, the restaurant, and the pool staff. Our chef and team work hard to provide excellent service, and it’s encouraging to know that their efforts were appreciated.
We are glad that you found the breakfast spread to your satisfaction and the suite room spacious.
 
Negatives:
We sincerely apologize for the unfortunate incident involving a bat in your room. This is certainly not the standard of experience we aim to provide. We have taken immediate steps to inspect and rectify any potential entry points for wildlife. However, we must clarify the situation as follows, the bat was reported on the night before your departure after you had stayed for three days without any issues. Our team responded immediately, inspected the room, and found no evidence of a bat or any entry points in the ceiling. Additionally, our engineering team confirmed there were no holes in the roof. As a tropical country, Sri Lanka is home to various wildlife, including fruit bats. We provided information to guests, advising them to keep balcony doors closed, especially at night. We offered you an immediate room change, which you accepted.
 
We understand your frustration regarding the handling of this incident. It is never our intention to make our guests feel unheard or disrespected. We are reviewing this situation with our management team to ensure such instances are managed more appropriately in the future.
 
Regarding the refund, we apologize for the inconvenience and dissatisfaction caused. We will revisit our policies to ensure they better align with guest expectations and comfort in exceptional circumstances. We understand the unique expectations of our guests and strive to provide the highest level of hospitality. It’s unfortunate that you did not experience this during your stay. However, it’s important to note that your experience appears to be an isolated incident. In our ten-year history, we have not had any similar reports.
 
We acknowledge your concerns about the value and quality of our Hotel. Your feedback is valuable as we continuously strive to improve the decor and overall guest experience.
 
We genuinely regret that your stay did not reflect the high standards we set for ourselves. We hope you might reconsider and give us another opportunity to provide you with the luxurious and hospitable experience that we aim to deliver, that we are known for.
 
Thank you once again for your feedback.
 
Warm regards

Very over-priced for what it is, terrible management & not good for young children! 

To start with the positives: in general, the outdoor space is nice, and the restaurant and pool staff are really lovely. The chef is also super nice. The breakfast spread is decent. The suite room was large.

The negatives: The fact that there was a bat in our room, and that the manager accused us of making it up / that we let them in by leaving the door open. There was an obvious hole in the roof. Refused to give refund for the night we had to vacate our bat-room at nearly midnight with a 4 month old baby. Offered an insulting 40 USD discount on room extras that we declined. 

A very overpriced stay (370 a night) and the hotel decor and finishings feel cheap & tacky with no hospitality from management. Not worth it at all, and not a luxurious hotel at all.","worst hotel we stayed in in Sri Lanka.

"0","911958340","en","7788909",,"Owner","921034136","en","2023-10-12","Loyola F","Firstly, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you and your family for your continued support and for choosing our hotel for your stay once again Palavathani Palachandran. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we appreciate your loyalty.
 
I want to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you faced upon your recent visit. I understand how important it is to ensure that all guests have a comfortable and pleasant stay, including their drivers. However, I would like to clarify that there is no specific law mandated by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) that enforces accommodation for drivers accompanying guests. It is a practice that may vary from one hotel to another, depending on their policies and availability.
 
That being said, we are pleased that our manager was able to step in and assist in finding alternative accommodations for your drivers. We always strive to go above and beyond to make our guests' experiences as enjoyable as possible. Nevertheless, we must express our deep disappointment at the reported incidents of rudeness and abusive language directed towards our staff and manager by the driver, Asanka Jayasekara. Such behavior is entirely unacceptable, and it is our priority to maintain a respectful and welcoming environment for all our guests and not only for the driver and for our team members as well.
 
It's truly regrettable to hear about the issues with the pool, including the broken tiles and the high chlorine levels. Please accept our deepest apologies for any injuries and discomfort this may have caused to your nephew and the other guests. We take such matters seriously, and we are actively addressing them to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.
Your feedback regarding the condition of our facilities, including the wear and tear in the pool area and the rooms, is duly noted. We are committed to enhancing our property and appreciate your input, which will aid us in our ongoing efforts to improve our guest experience.
 
It is important to note that your group had a total of seven bookings made through various platforms, each with distinct criteria and check-out dates. We understand that this may have caused some confusion, especially as some of these bookings shared similar guest names. While we always strive to ensure our guests have a smooth and pleasant stay, we acknowledge that there were instances of room allocation issues that occurred. Additionally, we were unaware that Mr. Stephen, Mrs. Suzanne, and Ms. Talia were part of the same group until they arrive to the hotel.
 
In reference to our WhatsApp communication, we maintain a standard procedure of reaching out to arriving guests one day prior to their check-in. This practice enables us to verify their expected arrival time, gather information about meal preferences, arrange suitable bed accommodations, and cater to any specific requirements they may have. We undertake these measures with the aim of ensuring a comfortable and relaxing stay for our valued guests.
The invoice sent to you pertains to an on-call doctor's visit during your stay. Unfortunately, this invoice remained unpaid, and we understand there was some confusion surrounding it. When Mrs. Devi fell in ill during your stay, our immediate response was to engage the services of on-call doctor, who recommended hospitalization for your mother. We deeply care for the well-being of our guests and acted promptly to ensure Mrs. Devi received the necessary medical attention.
 
We acknowledge that there was some delay in issuing the invoice due to the doctor's schedule and Mrs. Devi's condition. We had assumed that payment would be made during your stay. However, we understand that there was a misunderstanding, and you intended to settle the invoice once you returned home due to limited Wi-Fi connectivity during your travels.
We also recognize that there were a few reminders sent for payment while you were in Sri Lanka, which you found to be excessive. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Additionally, we understand your concern about the international transfer charge, and we regret any confusion regarding this matter.
 
The lagoon view is indeed one of our most cherished features, and we're delighted that you found it lovely and peaceful. It's a true gem of tranquility that allows our guests to unwind and connect with nature.
We couldn't agree more about our hotel's prime location, and we're pleased that you were able to explore Trinco easily and enjoy the local restaurants. Our team takes great pride in recommending the best spots to our guests, ensuring that you have a truly immersive experience.
 
Your kind words about our restaurant warms our hearts. We're thrilled to hear that you found the food to be of high quality, and that the service was excellent. Our culinary team works tirelessly to create delicious and memorable dishes, and the restaurant staff takes great pride in providing top-notch service. We will be sure to pass along your compliments to them.
 
Please know that we take your feedback seriously, and we will use it as an opportunity to enhance our services and address any issues that may arise in the future. We genuinely hope that this isolated incident will not deter you from considering a return visit, and we would be honored to have the chance to regain your trust and provide you with the exceptional experience you deserve.
 
Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, and we look forward to the possibility of serving you and your family in the future.

Unfortunately it is sad to say our experience this time was not the same. 

The first issue we had is that we had 4 vans travelling from Jaffna to Trinco, and the first party arrived to be told that there was not enough rooms for our drivers to stay at the hotel (even though by law the hotels in Sri Lanka must provide accommodation for drivers accompanying their guests). The first driver got upset/by all account was rude to staff - this is unacceptable, however he was reacting to be told he and the 3 other drivers had no place to stay after a long drive - and being told that the hotel would not help rectify this situation. Finally when my sister arrived she managed to have a helpful conversation with the manager who agreed to find and pay for alternative accommodation for all the drivers. 

The next day my family and I spent the whole day in the pool - unfortunately this is where we had our next issue. My nephew and I both cut ourselves on broken tiles in the pool - there is quite wear and tear visible now compared to our trip in 2017. The worst part is that the chlorine levels in the pool were too high so all the children and quite a few of the adults had chemical burns - at first when the children were crying and complaining of rashes we reported this to staff and they were dismissive saying it due to the heat - we had been in Sri Lanka for a week prior to this and the children were fine! We had also been in the pool at the The Thinnai in Jaffna and again had no problems like this! Staff then eventually tested the water, and added a tube into the pool to restore the balance - however the kids did not wish to go back into the pool for the remainder of our time here sadly. 

The hotel definitely needs some renovations as the wear and tear is apparent throughout (including the rooms). 

The last issue I would like to mention is the unnecessary communication via Whatsapp - prior to our stay each of our party had been messaged to confirm our bookings - all fine. When I responded to say that's perfect and to just double check I had a twin room as booked I received a call from the hotel - it was clear that they were getting confused with the bookings as we have similar names but again this was fine - I clarified this but then when we arrived on the day to check in it was clear there was confusion with rooms again and rooms were not allocated properly in advance. Then during our stay unfortunately my Mum needed the attention of the doctor which the hotel was swift in organising - again all fine but after we checked out a few days later I received an invoice via WhatsApp for this doctor's visit. I responded to say I was travelling at the time and not on proper Wi-Fi but would pay this when I got back to the UK. I received a response to say ""Well noted. You can do once you reach there."" Then a couple of days later I received another 3 text messages relating to this payment - again I responded to say I will pay it this week (as I had just arrived back in the UK) - again the person text to say ""sure well noted."" Then the next day I got another text asking for the same thing to which I had to respond saying please stop texting me now as I have said I will pay this week! I felt pestered over WhatsApp. I made the payment and was charged £10 extra for this international payment (there was no mention of this payment upon checking out) then when I sent them the screenshot of the payment confirmed I received a long text message ending with ""Kindly let us know when it would convenient for you to address the outstanding bill."" Whoever is responsible for this communication via WhatsApp on behalf of the hotel just says 'well noted"" but nothing is actually noted!  

The positives for this hotel are the view of the lagoon is very lovely and peaceful. It's a good location to explore Trinco near lots of nice local and restaurants. The restaurant at the hotel serves lovely, quality food and the service is excellent! Staff in the restaurant are very attentive.

We sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience you had during your time with us. Our aim is to consistently deliver a high standard of service and it is clear that we fell short of your expectations on this occasion.
 
We deeply regret that the pool did not meet your expectations. We understand that its condition was not up to par and did not reflect the images you saw prior to your arrival. Please rest assured that we have addressed this issue with our maintenance team to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future.
 
Moreover, we are truly sorry for the state of the bathroom in your standard room. It is disheartening to learn about the various issues you encountered, including the brown and black kit edges, rusty grout pits, loose faucet, crooked mirror, and a dirty ventilation wheel. We take this matter seriously, and immediate steps have been taken to rectify these problems. Our housekeeping and maintenance teams have been thoroughly briefed and will pay extra attention to the cleanliness and maintenance of our rooms and facilities.
 
We are glad to hear that you enjoyed the breakfast and noticed a change in the food selection during your stay. However, we understand that these positives do not compensate for the overall disappointment you experienced. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.
 
We appreciate your honest feedback as it gives us the opportunity to address areas of improvement and ensure that our guests have a comfortable and memorable stay.

They did not mention anything about this when booking this room. Hotel is rather small and not upto the standard of a four star hotel. Food is very ordinary type of restaurant food. I am amazed to see a four star belt given to this hotel after experiencing this. You can get a very nice experience in Trincomalee in other places available for the price you pay here.

You arrived early to check-in but since your room was not ready, hotel staff extended their courtesy so you can use the pool and restaurant facilities while your room was being prepared. Your room was made available within 20 minutes but according to our front office staff, you wanted to cancel the reservation because one of your relatives was not feeling well and you had to return to Colombo.
 
I’ll hence address the points you brought up in your review:
 
""comment that the pictures of this hotel doesn’t reflect the reality in booking apps""
It seems like you're attempting to discredit our hotel by targeting all the good effort and time that our past guests have invested when writing their own personal reviews for TripAdvisor.  Claiming that their posted  photos and reviews are deceptive is surely not a productive and fair way to engage in a critique of our establishment.
Our property has been lucky to have been reviewed by almost 450 guests within the last three years since we've opened. These reviews portray each guests’ singularly unique depiction of what our hotel and facilities offer here upon the lagoon.  We feel the conversations have been satisfying and productive for both sides, and we therefore choose to let these reviews speak for themselves. :)

""Location is just lagoon and you can’t swim there , not sea. Sea is 10 min walk away and the way is not good”
We purposely chose the lagoon for our hotel, as we wanted to create a secluded and restive atmosphere, but if surf’s your thing, and it’s quite popular, we have our own aqua taxi that will ferry you and your belongings down stream to the beach. Or, if you’re looking for a sunny walk, just mosey on down the path, and you’ll get there in about five minutes. :)

I'm hoping that there will be another day when you’ll visit our little corner of Trincomalee and  give us another chance to regale and win back your business!

With sincere thoughts and kindness

The entrace and overall setting including the restuarant, I feel like this is kind of B/B Inns property.  Food is very average and not delicious as well.

But considering the fact that we paid USD 250.- per room and night, I think it is important to write that the services in the hotel do not correspond to this price-level and that we were really disappointed. 

The good news: The premises are really nice and you have got a nice view on the river(-island). The staff is really friendly and helpful.

The bad news consist of many details. Summarizing these details this is definitely not a five-star-hotel (even taking into account that we are talking about Sri Lankan categories). Rooms, restaurant and services are overpriced. The staff seems to be untrained. Any sign of management is missing. Some of the details:

- The way to our room was covered with birds-excrements. This was cleaned on day 4.
- The sunbeds are also partly covered with birds-excrements. Nobody seems to clean them.
- There is no coffee in the hotel but filter-coffee.
- Although there is a great variety of food at the breakfast-buffet, nothing looks really appetizing. The scrambled eggs seem to be made of egg-powder. Fruits come out of tin-cans. Juices are not fresh.
- There is promotion of Corona beer everywhere. When you order it, they tell you they don‘t have.
- The cocktail of the day is a cocktail with Gin. When you order it, they tell you that they ran out of Gin.
- The music in the restaurant is simply horrible. This is not a question of taste. It is a „no-go“ to play such cheap music. 
- I order a coke, they bring me a „hot“ coke without gaz because the coke was stored outside in the heat of the day.
- I want to go by the hotel‘s kayak on the river. They charge you USD 5 although the paddle is broken.
- The hotel has no beach. They offer to bring you to the beach by boat. This is a good offer. But they let you out in the middle of nowhere although there are some good parts of the beach with natural shadow and some little infrastructure. Not very attractive.
- On day 4 they forgot to make up our room. 
- I already mentioned that the staff was really friendly. But whenever you needed someone, you could hardly find anyone. In many cases they misunderstood what you said. In some cases they simply forgot what you ordered. We didn‘t have the feeling that they had any training in hotel and hospitality skills. Or it was simply a lack of good management.

These problems are not really big. I think it is a question of management. But Amaranthe Bay considers itself as a 5*-hotel and charges the amount of money for a 5*-hotel. That‘s the problem! It is far from being on the level of a luxury or high-level-hotel.

Price-quality ratio is completely uneven and when we relayed our feedback (read below) to the hotel manager, no action was taken. 
Without any doubt we will not lodge again in Amaranthe Bay. We spent there 2 nights (2 people, couple) and we will not repeat.

Regarding the HOTEL STAFF, we would like to state that we were able to perceive a disorganization from the second we checked in: we were told that breakfast for the 2 nights we were staying was included (we were paying 500 USD in total) and the following day, after having the breakfast, they brought the bill to the table confirming that they had made a mistake and that it wasn't included. When we insisted that we were said otherwise, they said that they were sorry but that the breakfast had to be charged. 
In addition to this, the restaurant staff was not tidy. When we asked for non used cutterly, they'd take forks from tables that have already been used by other guests. The service was also slow and the 2 times we called them from our room (asking for shampoo and a bottle opener), although they said they were going to take care of our need, nobody ever come to the room with these items we requested.
Gel and shampoo was not refill either during our stay. 

Regarding our ROOM (Junior Suite), we had several light black outs during our stay, the curtains and the window of our room were broken and we even found a lizard next to our bed, besides all the ants.

As stated above, the most disappointing part is when we requested to speak to the Hotel responsible and no action was taken. He listened to us and did not give us any compensation. Unacceptable for a 5 star hotel.

By far, Amaranthe Bay is the worst quality-relation hotel we've been in SRI LANKA in 3 weeks stay.","Overpriced and inefficient and disorganized service","2017-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r517435120-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

I’m sorry that you had a less than perfect experience while considering an overnight stay with us, but it’s unfortunate that you’ve chosen such a title for your review.  Attempting to discredit all the time and good effort that our guests have invested when writing their reviews for TripAdvisor by claiming that their posted  photos and reviews are deceptive is surely not a productive and fair way to engage in a critique of our establishment. I would have much preferred if you had instead addressed the conversation between youreself and my team without blaming our guests for an experience regarding a perception you felt was untrue.  I’m not at all a fan of having to “air” dirty laundry, but in this case feel the need to defend what we believe is the integrity of Amaranthe Bay as well as the efforts of past guests :) I’ll hence address the points you brought up in your review below:
“The actual place looks a lot different to the images you find online”
-Our property has been reviewed by more than 280  guests and these reviews portray our guests’ depiction of what our hotel and facilities are here on the lagoon.  We feel the conversations have been satisfying and productive for both sides, and we choose to let these reviews speak for themselves :)
""Service was bad as we waited over 30 minutes in the reception area because they had difficulty finding the booking we made online.""
-Our hotel check-in time is 2 PM. If guests arrive prior to this time, we do our very best to accommodate them as soon as possible when rooms become ready. You had arrived around 1 PM, and the room was booked via Booking.com as a single room occupancy. Contrary to your claim, our front office had no issues finding the reservation, as we found your booking.com voucher and confirm that you had only booked for a single room occupancy. As you had showed up instead as 2 guests rather than the single guest occupancy you had booked originally for, you were advised about the rate for double occupancy, and this was where the 30 minutes of time was spent, as you did not want to pay for a double occupancy.  :(
“We were told that lunch buffet is open till 2:30pm, but even at 1:30 pm there was no food left.“
-On that day, we had over 20 guests having lunch in the restaurant. The buffet was closed around 3 PM. There was enough food in the trays for all the guests. I believe at this point you were frustrated and annoyed, decided not to stay with us and then left. We then, consequently, had to update the booking.com reservation as a “ NO SHOW’ which will reflect upon your booking.com record :(
As such, I consider it a deep loss for us that we were unable to satisfy your needs and do apologize for any inconvenience you may have suffered. We’ll never have another first-time to show you what so many others have enjoyed here at our hotel, and this is what truly disheartens me.  I'm hoping there will be another day when you’ll be in our little corner of Trincomalee and once again give us a chance to regale and win back your business.

The hotel however is located on a lagoon where cattle traverse through every evening so you cannot swim there. The pool is fine but if you want to lie out there for the day there are only 4 umbrellas for shade so first come first served. If you want to go to the beach you can walk three minutes to the next hotel but they will charge you €36 per day to use the sun loungers. Amaranthe should ideally have something arranged that their guests don't have to incur further expense. 

We stayed for four nights and our driver only stayed for one. We had two drivers and they made us pay 1500 for the extra driver despite not having had to accommodate anyone for three nights.

The morning buffet is extremely disappointing and the selection is limited with an airport type atmosphere. We ate out every evening. There are some lovely restaurants near by. 

No gym or turn down service.

We booked late and therefore may have paid too much... It might be ok if you book in advance and get a fair price. 

The rooms are excellent. Good jacuzzi. Clean. Good tv. Safe. Private balcony. Good views. Big windows. 

There are some down sides. It is on the lagoon not on the beach. If you go the beach and want shade / a sun lounger, it will be expensive. The beach is fantastic. If you stay by the pool, there are a limited number of umbrellas and if you don't arrive early, you don't get one. It is crazy to pay so much for a hotel and then have to pay 36 euro for 2 sun loungers on the beach. 

The staff are really really helpful. The free bikes are ok and you can cycle to the temple or other sites. The big problem is that you are not on the beach. This hotel should have a arrangement for discounted or free sun loungers with a beach hotel.  

The breakfast is ok. The cocktails are good. 

It's is not a 5 star place but the staff do try. They mean well but it is a bit of a shambles.

There should be more fruit for breakfast. The rooms are great but the pool area really needs to be improved.

What it was supposed a relaxing last night & day after heading back to Europe, turned out to be a ridiculous experience. 

Staff is wonderful, nice, caring and attentive but...
1- our room (blue room) was not in its best conditions: bad maintained painting, a/c not working properly, general light switch broken, cables and quite dusty. 
You had to go up to it through the accountants office and is located next to the staff room, so it’s noisy.
2- breakfast was great 
3-  “pool premises not available after check out”. The manager send the nice receptionist to tell us we couldn’t use the sun beds after check out because the hotel was fully booked (12 sun beds, just 4 being used at that moment). I’ve never hear such a nonsense thing in a hotel. So after 02.00pm we should wait sitting on a couch until pick up time. So we left. I told the receptionist before checking in and out, but this absurd information came after the visa payment, of course
After my complaint, the answer from the manager  was “no”. So we left to another hotel after noon to spend the day, with no restrictions and 100% Sri Lanka kindness.

So, you guys!!!
- do not trust booking quality ratings 
- do not trust pictures, not updated

There is also an excellent breakfast.

However, given that it was one of the more expensive we stayed in during our 2 week trip, it did let us down somewhat. 

We stayed in the green room and this was accessed directly off reception, giving us little privacy and meaning we could hear the music and pool table being played on when trying to sleep. There was no opening window in the room and given the access we didn't feel comfortable opening the door so were unable to let in any fresh air. The air conditioning in the room worked fine but the bathroom was slifling hot. The tiles to the shower area were more like outdoor paving with a soily grout. 

The coloured paintwork looks nice in photos but in reality the 'boutique' theming of the hotel is not particularly well done. This might be forgiven if the nighly rate was half what it is. Upon check out we were informed that the hotel was shortly closing for a refurbishment so perhaps they could address some of the shortfalls in the design and practitcalities. 

The property is located down a lane off the main strip of restaurants and shops, so is quiet. However, the lane is not lit and was a little intimidating when returning during the evening. The signal of the free wifi was also poor.

The hotel is gay friendly, which is not an issue for us at all. However, we were slightly uncomfortable to see 'company being sought' just outside the front entrance and found ourselves questioning the role of so many young men in such a small hotel.

To be honest there really isn't much of value in Negombo and if we came again we would just go straight from the airport to our next location, rather than making a stop there.","Let us down","2017-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2325134-r495797784-Dickman_Resort-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

L’accueil est sympathique sans plus et nous n’avons eu la chambre qu’en fin d'après-midi donc partant en balade en arrivant de l’aéroport nous avons dû nous changer dans le lobby, pas top. Nous avons pris un petit-déjeuner et un thé et il nous a été chargé deux petits déjeuner extérieurs donc beaucoup plus cher et nous avons demander la rectification.

La chambre, plafond avec infiltration d��eau et peinture qui boursoufle, climatisation mal fixée donc très bruyante, bonne literie, pas de vrai bureau, une bouilloire cassée, décoration minimaliste. Sans le bruit de la climatisation toute la nuit, calme donc nous aurions bien dormi. Coffre et rangements ok. La lampe de chevet était défectueuse avec court-circuit et une autre lampe ne fonctionnait pas donc très sombre. Wifi ok dans la chambre.

Salle de bain,  bien avec wc séparé, douche à l’italienne grande et baignoire. Juste shampooing et gel douche, pas d'après-shampoing, ni de vanity, ni de brosse à dents…..service minimum. Le meilleur, un sèche cheveux hors d’age très sale avec fils apparent dont il a fallu demander trois fois le changement avant que ce ne soit enfin fait car le personnel ne comprenait pas où était le problème. Pas de serviettes à l'arrivée, il à fallu en demander ni de chaussons. 

Nous n’avons pas pris le dîner vu le petit-déjeuner : pain et viennoiseries industrielles, offre de fruits limite et aucun fruit non coupé (banane, rambutan…). Café à éviter, thé très fort mais ok. Offre de salé correcte avec des curry de poisson très bon. Gaufres ok mais oubliez la chantilly ou sirop d’érable ou miel ou sauce chocolat et une seule confiture. Pas de noix ni de graines pour les céréales mais des corn-flakes, des ersatz de chocapic et basta. Service avec de nombreux stagiaires à l’anglais balbutiant. Quand même comptoir œufs et hoppers. 

Nous n’avons pas testé le bar ni la piscine ni le spa. La salle de sport est très bien avec un prof toujours présent et une grande amplitude horaire.

To start, there was no mention of the large construction project at the hotel entrance on their website. We also weren’t offered a welcome drink, which is usually standard for a resort of this level. During our stay, repairs unexpectedly blocked access to another stairway, causing major inconvenience and wasted time.
Lunch on the first day was the only highlight—tasty and well-prepared. Unfortunately, this was not the case for dinner and breakfast, which were extremely bland. Basic Sri Lankan dishes, including rice and curry, were tasteless, and some items from dinner were repurposed for breakfast. I’ve never had such uninspired food at a hotel in Sri Lanka.
The room was basic and poorly maintained, with issues like a tub with no hot water. Service was inconsistent, and check-in took longer than it should have. Most staff seemed indifferent, though one restaurant employee, Prasanna, went above and beyond to help us. On our final day, the Head Chef asked for feedback, but by then, it felt like too little, too late.
If you’re considering Aliya Resort and Spa, I’d advise looking elsewhere. The resort no longer lives up to its reputation, and the quality has dropped significantly. Not worth the price—would not recommend staying here.","Disappointing Stay – Not Worth the Price","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r979345657-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

We are extremely disheartened to hear the comments made by you regarding your experiences at our property four months after your stay with us, which was clearly instigated by a different incident rather than the actual conditions / quality of the property. No guest complaint was made by you or any one in your group, at the property or immediately after departure regarding the conditions, the food quality or the kid friendly nature of the property. The only concern raised was regarding some scratch marks on the vehicle exterior at the point of checkout. It was presumed to be due to wild monkey movements however with no solid proof to back this, it is quite vague as to when & how the damage was caused. 
As you are well aware, parking anywhere across the globe is at the customers risk & not the responsibility of the car park owners. Same principle is being applied at our property as well & public notices are on display in this regard. Despite same, the management has gone over & beyond to coordinate & facilitate an insurance claim through the hotel’s insurance to compensate for some of the damage. Further in order to mitigate the discomfort of your group during the inquiry process, the management has offered various amenities & even waived off the extra bills.
Having operated the hotel for nearly a decade we have come across various issues which have all been amicably resolved. However, this is the very first time we have come across unprofessional guests who have gone to the extreme of coordinating cordially with the hotel till the insurance claim was processed and the transactions completed; to go on line & make undue accusations to the hotel on social media platforms. Despite the support extended to you by our Assistant Manager, you have incriminated him online as well. This is rather uncalled for and unacceptable. As a group that goes out of the way to make customer stays memorable, we, sincerely believe that your approach to this situation is unethical & unprofessional. 
We sincerely hope you look at all that has been done to support you & your group during this incident. While all your comments are noted by the property, we hope you will be genuine in your comments regarding your stays in future.

He  has a very blunt attitude towards the guests  and living with lies and then changes his words bringing distrust all the time. Aliya resort is a place you should NOT visit if you need a hassle free time &  going there for relaxation. 

The Food was horrible in terms of taste, variety & quality. And not a place to go with kids especially with infants because there’s no absolutely a kids friendly environment. It’s purely the money they want and the stay at aliya is absolutely not worth the money you pay for.

If someone needs to spend your money to buy problems and stress , then you may consider 
booking a stay at this hotel.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences and shortcomings you encountered during your visit. Please know that your comments have been promptly conveyed to our management and staff, and we are taking them seriously to address the issues and improve our services.

Regarding the room allocation, we want to clarify that both rooms were allocated as per your reservation request. However, upon check-in, you mentioned that you might be able to comfortably fit into one room, as it had two big beds, two bathrooms, and ample privacy for your 14-year-old. We apologize if there was any confusion or miscommunication regarding this matter. 

We never intended to suggest or encourage you to cancel the second room. Instead, we merely informed you that if you chose to cancel it, our last-minute cancellation policy might not allow for a refund. Our aim is always to be transparent and fair in our dealings with guests.

Regarding the sauna, we are pleased to hear that one of our housekeeping and maintenance team members confirmed it was operating as it should. 

As for the bar service and the birthday dinner, we deeply regret that the quality of food did not meet your expectations. Rest assured, we are already working closely with our culinary team to make necessary improvements and enhance the overall dining experience.

Once again, we genuinely apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and it is our sincere hope that you would consider giving us another chance to demonstrate the high standard of service and hospitality we are known for. Should you plan to stay with us again in the future, we assure you that we will make every effort to ensure a more enjoyable and memorable experience.

If there is anything else you would like to discuss or if you have any further feedback, please feel free to reach out to us. We truly value your patronage and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back soon.

So can I start by saying avoid this hotel if you can. You don’t need to read the rest of this review if you don’t want to. 

For those that want the detail, when we got there after a short delay a very pleasant lady showed us to our rooms. We were a family of 5 for this trip and on the recommendation of our travel agent we had booked rooms next to each other of the same size and style. 

Our rooms were enormous. The lady showing us the room asked us if we really wanted the second room as we would comfortably fit into the room we were looking at which had 2 big beds, 2 bathrooms and plenty of privacy for our 14 year old. 

We asked the pleasant lady whether we would get a refund if we didn’t take the second room. “Of course” she replied, or should I say lied, “I will confirm with my boss.” 

We told our travel agent who over the next few days told us to get it in writing from this particular hotel. Obviously they have form. We tried a few times and eventually spoke to the manager on the penultimate day of our stay. He said there was no agreement to refund us. The pleasant lying lady was there for the chat and spoke in Sri Lankan to avoid us knowing what she was telling her boss. 

The manager said we were at liberty to use the hotel room for the rest of the stay ie the last night. Yeah, thanks for that. We told them we were not happy at all and had been deprived the room for all of our stay based on what we had been told. The manager looked us in the eye and said that the lady had no authority to offer the refund and as a result matters were out of his hands. Thanks for that too. 

Aside from misleading us, we asked for sheets for our son, 4 times on the first night before they delivered a single sheet that we were supposed to use on the daybed. He slept with us. 

We went to the bar for drinks twice. The first time we left when we decided that life was just too short, the second time it took an age for the drinks to arrive. 

The room had its own sauna. It never worked. They fixed it three times. It still never worked. The staff have a habit of looking you in the eye and saying things are sorted when they aren’t. Frustrating. 

One day our family of five asked for transport to a local restaurant. They ordered a single tuk, built for 2/3 people. Absolutely thoughtless and incompetent. 

Worst of all was a birthday dinner. Organised to be by the pool, the kids could play whilst the adults are eating. The food was pretty inedible. We tried to make up for that with drinks but at one time I ordered a gin and tonic and was given a piece of lime in a glass. 

There are clear communications with the staff, very few of whom speak adequate English. They compensate by smiling and saying yes to everything. 

To add insult to injury, there is a feedback form that you complete, seal and it gets posted to head office. I completed it, sealed it and 5 minutes later as we sat waiting for our luggage to be delivered from the room the manager came running over to ask us what was wrong with the sauna. He’d obviously intercepted the letter intended for head office which is pretty disingenuous. 

It is hard to think of anything right about the hotel. I’m just happy we spent most days out and about.","Think twice before booking","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r904301298-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

This is our second visit to the same property. However, compared to my previous visits, the service quality has dropped drastically. Even though we arrived at the hotel with a pre-booked room, the front desk took approximately 30-40 minutes to assign us a room. The rooms were clean and spacious. 
After a few unsuccessful attempts in contacting the maintenance department, we had to remind the receptionist twice to check the cable TV.
Their dinner buffet had a good spread with 3–4 action stations and catered to both western and Sri Lankan cuisine. though the restaurant service was on the slower side.
The following day was a rainy day, and, surprisingly, there were no umbrellas available in the rooms to go for breakfast. We noticed that it was a common issue for most of the adjoining room guests as well. We had to call the receptionist four times to request umbrellas and wait nearly 40 minutes to find two umbrellas, which were taken away (kept in the basket at the corner of the main building) when we returned from the restaurant.
The same thing happened during lunchtime, after waiting 30 minutes and making a few requests. I decided to bring my own umbrellas in my car, which was parked in the other corner of the hotel, even though it rained. Somehow, front office staff contacted me and informed me to release the key or room as soon as possible, though they forgot to provide even a single umbrella.
When we returned to the restaurant, I handed over the room keys to the front office around 12.45 pm and requested my bags be kept in the guest reception/departure area. 
After lunch, we noticed that our bags were not in the reception/departure area. The 02 staff members were not informed until I requested my bags several times. They were informed around 2.40 p.m. The internal coordination was very poor, which is disappointing for a hotel of this standard. 
I raised a complaint through Aliya Reports' FB Messenger link on December 22, 2022, and will never recommend this to anyone due to this rude and unpleasant staff service.","Superb location but very poor staff/Customer Service","2022-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r877519224-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

We thank you for your recent visit to Aliya Resort and Spa Sigiriya. 
Thank you for commending on the Spa treatment and our Executive Chef.
We deeply regret to note that your recent experience with us was not up to your expectation.
However, we do not agree on the comments made about the room,  check in process, pool and the Manager at Aliya Resort.
The room was ready and allocated as requested by your local travel agent. Since you wanted to see other room categories the process took longer than expected. 
With regard to the leakage on the bathtub, we have taken necessary action and rectified the issue immediately. 
The Suite room was only available for 1 night stay; however, your booking was for 2 nights. 
The Hotel concept and its design is a personal preference and it's beyond our control.  Many of our valuable guests visited Aliya has praised and valued the concept and its design. 
We trust the local travel agent has shared all relevant details about the hotel with the guests, the same is available in all online platforms and it gives a very good insight into the property 
We have always worked towards our guest’s expectation and satisfaction as well as continuously working on understanding the unique requirements of each and every guests.
Furthermore, we always strive to make a difference through our outstanding service, facilities and standards. Once again regret that it was not up to the guest’s satisfaction. 
We are looking forward to welcoming the guests again to experience the Theme Resorts & Spas hospitality.

Warm Regards,

We found a massive concrete structure with zero charm and quite far away from the Sigiriya rock.
Front desk staff took a long time - after a well trained but not convincing ceremonial - to give us a room. While the hotel had plenty of empty rooms, it took us two hours to get a room. Very disappointing room I must say, quite large but basic and with a flagrant lack of taste and style. 
We inquired about other types of rooms available and got to see a cottage room, quite oldy and with zero light. We realized later on that the assistant manager of the resort lied straight to our face because suites were also available. We would have been quite happy to pay extra just to get a decent room. 
Basically, the only think the resort sells is the huge swimming pool overlooking the greenery and with views on the Sigiriya rock. Unfortunately, the water of the swimming pool is far from clear, we couldn’t see our feet in the pool with a depth of 1.2 m. 
In short, the resort has 90+ rooms and works like a big factory. 
Moreover, in our room we realized that the bathtub was leaking. The second day of our stay, the assistant manager lied again to us when we inquired about the suite, arguing they were all occupied while we could still book them on the booking websites including their own.
On the plus side, the executive chef was very helpful and nice, trying to make things as good as possible. Also, the Ayurvedic massage at the spa was very good.","Really bad surprise!","2022-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r856336590-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

No varieties. Just 2 or 3 options in mains. We doubt whether the hotel had a restaurant manager and enough staff to cater the guests. Water was not served. Finished plates were not cleared. Guests had to clear the tables by their own. Didn't expected this kind of service from a theme resort. Must tell again, if you invite people to spend their money on your hotel, give it the value. If you expect the people to visit you, have your people ready to give the service.

The last time these people came up with an offer like this,was after the Easter Attacks,when tourist arrivals spiraled and we booked our stay for 5800 Rs per person at Aliya. Right at the outset, I got so many calls from the front office and tried to promote their log cabins, claiming they were better in quality than the Deluxe rooms we originally booked.After a few calls, I sternly told them that I will not change our rooms blindly,and will need to have a look at those log cabins which were supposed to be superior in quality than the Deluxe rooms.Luckily,this was the best decision I made as  the log cabins were situated in an isolated area near the Entrance gate,away from the Restaurant,the Pool and the scenic view of Pidurangala and Sigiriya which is the only selling point for Aliya Resort.Even though their check in time is supposed to be 2 pm,we were given the room only at 3.30 pm,while we waited in the lobby area with little kids since 2.15 pm.A guy from the concierge just gave us our 3 keys, and asked us to proceed to our rooms,with no one to guide us or didn't even give us directions.We were wondering around the whole property for half an hour and we met a young lady from the front office escorting some foreigners to their rooms, who casually pointed us to the direction of our rooms when we inquired about the location,with no real attempt to help us.It was past 4 pm when we found our rooms and settled in...it took about another half an hour for our luggage to reach us...So we lost a good 2 1/2 hours of our stay due to Aliya front office staffs in competencies and complacency.Our stay was ok from then onward till the next morning when the front office kept calling us from 9.30 am and asked us to clear our rooms,despite the fact that the rooms were given 2 hours later because of their own fault.So we ultimately packed up and proceeded to the lobby to hand over the keys when a guy from the concierge rudely started yapping that we are late and there are people coming in who need the rooms at 2pm and bla bla bla...Wonder why the same attitude wasn't blurted at the previous guest as well and hand over the rooms at 2pm to us.The attitude of the front office staff was as such that all who took up on those offers from Aliya  were beggars and we were privileged to book rooms with them only because of the low offers advertised by them out of their generosity.As a person who had made a couple of bookings for 30,000/night at Aliya, when times were good for them,I was very offended at their demeaning attitude towards paying customers,who flocked into safe their jobs and finances due to low arrivals after the devastating attacks.Being a medical officer,my dad being a senior Dental surgeon,sister being a lawyer and my wife an Engineers, we were offended and humiliated by the front office staff and determined never to  book through any offers from Theme Resorts & Spas.If there's anyone else who want to brave the attitude of the front office staff and Still make a booking,avoid the log cabins at all costs.Furthermore,what the management should have done after I made my original post was to contact the property and take remedial action against the front office staff instead of blocking me from their page and removing the comment.This action alone is enough to state the obvious that the management is not at all bothered to accept their faults and atleast apologise. So in retaliation against deleting my original post,I wiill post this review on their tripadvisor and FB pages as well so this can't be removed any more.","Superb Property,Rude Front Office Staff","2019-08","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r755433993-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your comments on your stay at Aliya Resort & Spa.
 
The payment being made at the check-in is the general procedure in any hotel around the world therefore this is clearly a misunderstanding on your part.
 
We believe that the worm on the bed might have been a consequence of the rainy weather, and since this was in a wooden chalet in the midst of a forest, we believe this is not an unlikely scenario. However we attended to it as soon as we were informed, and we do apologize for the inconvenient caused by this. We see that minor inconvenience in the hotel room has driven you to write an unreasonable and enraged review about Aliya Resort.
 
We politely disregard all other accusations that you have made, and the reviews of our valuable guests who resided with us during the same period stand a clear testimony of the unparalleled service offered by our staff at Aliya Resort & Spa.

We, at Aliya Resort & Spa, thank you for taking your time to share your feedback with us, and sincerely apologize for the bad experience you had during your stay at our hotel. 

Due to the fact that there were four arrivals at the same time, we were compelled to check-in the guests in the order of arrival and therefore had to keep you waiting until it was your turn. However, we very humbly apologize for missing out on offering hot towels, which the staff may have forgotten to do because of the large number of guests that they had to attend to.

We were under obligation to strictly adhere to the check-in and check-out times since the hotel was fully occupied and it was crucial to attend to proper restoration of the rooms on time for the next check-in. We have strictly advised the guest relation officer who escorted you to your room with regard to your remark on his attitudes. 
 
We hope to welcome you back at Aliya Resort & Spa and make up to the unsatisfying stay that you had to experience.
Warm Regards,
Hotel Manager

“Greetings from Aliya resort and spa”
Thank you very much for spending your valuable time to write your feedback on trip advisor.
According to the industry standards, the decision of whether or not to open a buffet for the particular day is made at the last moment depending on the number of Pax residing at the hotel on that day. Therefore, it is impossible to specify this fact at the time of reservation.
While apologizing for your inconvenience, we hope that we will get a chance to welcome you again at Aliya in near future and assure your satisfaction in every aspect.

Greetings from all of us at Jetwing Kaduruketha!

I'm truly sorry to hear about your disappointing experience with the handling of your non-refundable booking. Your safety concerns during heavy rains, especially with small children, were noted for more empathy and flexibility. Hence, we agreed to extend your stay at Jetwing Kandy Gallery, where you stayed at that time, but you couldn’t agree on this option and moved out by requesting last minute cancelation. We deeply regret any inconvenience caused by our adherence to the non-refundable policy, and we understand how this approach may have left you dissatisfied.

We genuinely value our guests' circumstances and apologize for any lack of consideration you felt during this situation. We always aim to prioritize customer satisfaction and provide understanding in such cases.

We truly appreciate your feedback and understand your perspective. We'd love the opportunity to make it up to you with a more positive experience in the future.

Your comments on your recent experience with us at the point of making a reservation have been drawn to our attention. We regret the inconvenience caused by failing to adhere to the standards that we are known for. As you have correctly mentioned in your review, having been to several Jetwing Hotels, this is contrary to the high level of service standards we maintain. 

Thank you for mentioning Jetwing as one of the premier hotel brands in Sri Lanka and for your understanding that this is an isolated incident. Please allow us to take it as an opportunity to make efforts and continuously improve our service offered to guests. Your valued patronage of Jetwing hotels is of utmost importance to us and hope this experience will not discourage you to stay with us. Looking forward to welcoming you to Jetwing Kaduruketha in near the future.

Right in front of the room tractors are busy working on the paddy fields and so noisy and we book this hotel thinking of spending a quite time but it was a big mistake. Also to the right side of room 108 is the 3 wheeler park you better take care of your belongings and no privacy since all the time people walk in front of your room.

Thank you for taking the time to post a review on Trip Advisor. Your constructive feedback is greatly appreciated as it will help us improve our products and services in the future.

Please allow me to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for not having been able to meet up to your expectations with regards to certain areas of the hotel. 

We have noted your comments in regards to the privacy between the semi-attached bungalow and as you may have noticed, we are presently growing some bamboos between the 2 semi-attached bungalows to create the required privacy. We can assure you that this issue will be resolved within the next couple of months. However, we do have a non semi-attached bungalow which you may want to experience in the future.

In regards to the food offering, thank you for pointing out the portion issue and this is something I will be reviewing with the Executive Chef when designing the set menus we propose. You might be pleased to learn that we are presently reviewing our menu selection to increase the Sri Lankan food offering as well. We thank you for bringing this up to our attention.

It was otherwise pleasing to read that you found the team very helpful and that you appreciate the services rendered during your stay.

Jetwing Kaduruketha is surrounded by natural scenic views, paddy fields and a stunning views of the Poonagala mountain range. Strolling through the resort allows guest to experience the natural beauties all around and this is a part of the eco tourism experience we want our Guests to be a part of.

Once again, we thank you for your constructive comments. My team and I hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Jetwing Kaduruketha, in the near future.

Ayubowan (May you live long)

Every two villas were built jointly and you can hear what your neighbors are talking about. Also villas' walls were built out of bamboos and you are provided with fabric blinds to cover.The villa had a small veranda to relax yourself. But we felt the room did not have any privacy due to the architecture of the hotel room. We were disturbed by the noise of our neighbors. Also they could see us if we are sitting on the veranda.Rooms were clean and neat. But it was not that specious. Food were arranged by way of set menus and we did not like the variety at all. Also food portions were not enough for an individual & tasty. The hotel was fully occupied on the day we went and had a less number of staff to serve the people.But they tried to do their maximum though we had to wait for a long time once the order was placed. It is good if the hotel can include pictures of the dishes to their menu as it will help to get an understanding about what you are going to get on your table. Hotel surrounding was not that clean and appealing. We felt it was untidy.We noticed people were ordering food from the a la carte as well because the set menu was not enough to full their tummies. Though the hotel is promoting the brook down the hotel we felt there is nothing to get entertained in its. You have to walk a long distance from the entrance of the hotel to the restaurant and pool. Anyone  who is visitng wellawaya should not choose this hotel during drought season as the environment and surrounding looks terrible. This hotel best suits for families.I believe the hotel can do better by improving themselves to keep up their good name.","Hotel is below the expectation","2016-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r446013708-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

From the pictures it looks like an incredible, luxurious get away that should have been bliss and from what we knew about the Jetwing name we expected great service. As it was we arrived at this remote location to find little reason to want to stay. 

The setting is beautiful and the eco villas in nature is wonderful, however for somewhere so remote we expected a high level of service, facility and information. 

The swimming pool is amazing, but there are only enough deck chairs for 2 families. All around the pool is clearly unfinished and you have to hop over unbrushed concrete and stones to get to it. 

The staff are all very friendly but clearly untrained. We only stayed for dinner the first night. It is the most expensive meal we had in Sri Lanka, around 3000 rupes for a bland simple chicken curry. We had to wait a long time to get served, then the food took a long time, first the rice came, then i had to ask to bring out the curry. It should have come with 3 vegetable dishes and the waiter pointed at a curry leaf and a chili and said these are vegetables! I said ""no! they are spices."" Then showed him the menu and he returned with the side dishes... All the drinks were warm and they had run out of many things, the hotel was hardly busy. 

There was no information about what to do in the area, we had bikes and asked staff where to go and got vague points into the wilderness. In such a remote place some idea of where is nice to walk to or visit would have been very useful. There was no information at all about local attractions or hotel amenities. 

I think the room had Wifi but there was no code and by this point I was sick of asking the staff.

We booked a wake up call which didn't come. 

We ended up arranging all our own transport and activities and did not return to the hotel for dinner the second night, we had paid for breakfast the last day but had no interest to stay for it, we left 6.30am. 

On leaving I informed the man on reception that our stay had not met our expectations on the Jetwing brand and the service was bad, we just sort of smiled like he knew and agreed. They had already charged us for our room on arrival, I assume this is why.","Unfinished, Overpriced, Understaffed and Poor Service","2016-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r412578121-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

The room is nice with it a semi open concept allowing you to view out into the padi fields as you lie in bed. The outdoor bathroom is big with a good shower. The pool is of a decent size so what you see in the pictures are accurate enough. The staff are friendly, as they have been in every place i have stayed during my 2 weeks in Sri Lanka. The problem comes with the restaurant.  They don't really have a menu per se as every time I asked for one they told me they're just starting up (they opened in Nov 2015) so you're not quite sure what you can order. I had to ask twice before they took out a drinks menu which at least showed how much they charge. A bottle of beer was 700 rupees which is almost twice the price anywhere else.  This is a large hotel chain after all so you can decide if that is reasonable. What I found strange was for such a large chain, they didn't have a proper a la carte menu from the get go. Dinner is from a set menu. You get the feeling that things are quite put together with this place. Maybe the rushed the opening as a lot of the landscape was left as bare earth and rubble with the pool pavilion floors half done, which makes you trip if you try to go into the pool. You also get the sense that a lot of the staff are fairly new and it is quite hard to get service at the pool even though it is right below the restaurant. Hopefully it gets better because for USD$125 a night, this place sort of fell short.","Not quite ready.","2016-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r348124244-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

Greetings from Jetwing Kaduruketha,

Please accept our sincere apology that the facilities didn’t fulfill your expectations including the room facilities.

The hotel is themed around agro-tourism, organic farming, and authentic Old Ceylon Kandiyan village homes.

The reason there's no TV or air-conditioning is that the hotel encourages you to experience a traditional village life and farming culture of Sri Lanka. Our themed dwelling has walls made purely of bamboo shoots, so you get natural lighting in throughout the day and the view of the paddy fields along with the breeze which constantly blows from Poonagala mountain range, and It also helps to get constant noise with the thrums of birds constantly in the background.

We thank you for your detailed & candid feedback; we do regret that the service and the food did not meet your expectations on certain instances. All aspects highlighted by you have been taken note of for our betterment & we thank you for letting us know in detail.

We sincerely hope we will have another opportunity to serve you, if you do decide to stay with us again.

The place looks nice and is similar to the award winning jetwing property at vil uyana in Sigiriya but this has some severe shortcomings. To begin with, the rooms had no AC and no TV and this was a room priced at 31000LKR!. There is no privacy in bathing and toilet area. We had been given a twin room though we booked a double. Please verify this before you book. There were quite a few gekos in the room whose droppings could be found all over each morning.. On the positive side, the room was spacious with clean linen and good general cleanliness. There was a free WiFi service which was very good
The food tasted good but that's about all that is good about it. There were no buffet meals, even the hotel was quite full. We spent at least one and a half hours for each meal.  When all four adults in our party ordered rice and curry,  the curries were served in soup bowl sized dishes and refilling took ages and that too we had to ask ! You would loose appetite just waiting for food. It looked almost as they were reluctant to serve food ! The meals did not have much of a variety compared to hotels of similar class.  However It must be said  that the staff appeared to be doing all they can to be courteous and helpful  but they seem to be working in a system which is totally impractical.

The spa treatment was good though there were limited options.

This place offers a personal butler service for each room, who would also accompany you on exertions as a guide. They also provide two bicycles for each room.

There is a scenic pool with unusually cool water, which is quite nice in the climate.

If you have a relaxed schedule and do not care much for creature comforts, and is an ardent nature enthusiast,  this would be a very nice place  to stay. If you care for AC room comforts and plenty of good food to eat you just might be  disappointed.","A dissapointment at a great location","2016-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r345804530-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

This is not sabotage by a competitor or the review of some disgruntled ex-employee, please look at my many many other reviews of five star hotels around the world. I have also been for several years a Platinum member of the GHA Discovery loyalty programme of which Anantara is part.  
 
The hotel is on a peninsula by a lagoon so not really a ""beach hotel"" especially with large waves, being on the west coast.  It has the advantage of being relatively close to the airport as the expressway bypasses Colombo city.  
 
For context we stayed six nights, in a pool villa, at over US$1,000 per night for bed and breakfast, which also creates certain reasonable expectations (especially given Sri Lanka is not generally very expensive and this is not in a major city).  
 
Oh dear. Where to start.  
 
Maybe with the arrival. I could not believe the entrance to the hotel.  It could have been a municipal car park. No nice plants or flowers, just a concrete desk in the brutalist style.   And loads of parked cars with no hedge or anything to screen them.  Literally the worst first impression of any hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere in Asia.    
 
They do try, there is a delightful dance by some girls in local costume with drummers to escort you from the car park entrance to the actual reception, which is a nice touch. 
 
Hotels, in general, and including the Anantara, are not very good at appreciating that after a sixteen hour journey door-to-door, guests just want to get to their rooms, not wait around in very hot un-air-conditioned reception areas. You have all my details, the room is paid for, what takes so long?
 
Wine-gate
The next catastrophe was the religious holiday.  We had arrived two days before the local New Year's celebration.  Mea culpa.  I refer again to the 16 hour journey - we were looking forward to relaxing with a drink. However, the host who took us to the room declared that the hotel bars were now shut due to the holiday, and no alcohol was available for THREE DAYS.  Not, I'm afraid, our idea of a holiday. And half of our entire stay at this hotel. Why had they not e-mailed to warn us of this?  The same guy re-confirmed that by Whatsapp that afternoon, none of the restaurants or bars were serving alcohol.  But we could have alcohol delivered and drink it in the room.  So rather than an atmospheric dinner on our first night we had room service.   
 
So to have a drink the next day by our private pool we ordered beers on room service.  To save phoning again and waiting, answering the door again, we ordered four, and put two in the fridge.  Seemingly all good.  Until later when wanting to consume said beers, we discover there is no bottle opener in the suite. So, phone up again.  And wait.  After 20 minutes, phone again.  Two minutes later a bottle opener arrives.   Three minutes later another knock on the door, and a second bottle opener arrives!   
 
Then I realise that the wine we have ordered in advance for the evening (on the basis there is none in the restaurants) has a cork.  And there is no corkscrew in the room.  Sorry, the thousand-bucks-a-night suite. What they have delivered (twice) will only open beer/soda bottles.  So rather than waiting to call until after dinner I phone, again, and ask for a corkscrew, so I will be prepared.  A few minutes later same room service guy, says he has come to open the wine.  I don't want the wine opened now, I want the advanced technology to enable me to open it later that evening after returning from our (dry) dinner.   
 
Poor guy, he says it is his own personal corkscrew, but hands it over to me anyway, bless him.  I told him to go straight back and make the hotel give him a replacement.  I really hope they did. 
 
Went for dinner.  And guess what, they are serving wine, no problem. The embargo on alcohol was only for one night not three. 
 
The Anantara boasts three restaurants.  The main restaurant is an international buffet (you know the type).  It's alright, if that is what you are looking for in a five star experience. And an Italian (more later!). We chose to go to ""Spice Traders"", the Asian option.  The food was actually very good, with table service 'n all. An overall nice experience, more or less what we would expect. So far, so good. 
 
On two of the subsequent evenings we tried to book we were told Spice Traders was closed.  This left the five star hotel with a choice of only two restaurants: a buffet, or an Italian. And we had not really flown ten hours to eat Italian. Unacceptable and absolutely not as promoted.
 
I was really hoping to call out the Italian restaurant, Acquolino as a highlight.  We had lunch there, fresh pizza, which was excellent.  For dinner, I had a seafood risotto which was very very good indeed (fine dining standard). The wife had a good lamb shank, falling off the bone. All lovely.  
 
Sadly the wheels fell off with our final lunch.  I guess we chose badly, but the menu is limited and it was our fourth lunch there.  A terrible lasagne that could have been straight from a (down-market) supermarket and a tagliatelle dish with horrible tomato sauce, bland and far too sweet, seemingly out of a jar.  Such a shame. 
 
Bottled water:  there is definitely a problem with the bottled water supplier, or the Anantara is storing it for too long before use.  Increasingly through the stay, the water provided was off. And yes, water can go off!! It started as the occasional bottle, but by day six seemed to be every bottle we opened smelt of old socks.  We did not encounter this at any of the other four hotels at which we stayed in Sri Lanka.
 
We have stayed in several hotels around the world in rooms with private pools.  And never before have only two outdoor towels been provided. The whole point is you want to use the pool in the morning, before housekeeping comes, with a fresh towel.  You then use that one all day.  So provide four towels.  It does not increase the overall towel consumption at all. You simply start the day with a fresh towel. Pool suite etiquette 101. 
 
Checkout: the reception area is not air-conditioned so is naturally very hot and humid. The only ceiling fans are over on the other side of this area and nowhere near the desks.  The process is slow, and made infuriating by the fact that those behind the desk have standalone desk fans on full blast.  Pointing at the staff (who are accustomed to the heat) rather than the paying guests!!
 
There is then a leaving ceremony to wish you well on your journey, which is another nice touch.  
 
All the staff were very polite and friendly and keen for us to be happy. And there was certainly no shortage of staff. But providing a five star experience is all about attention to detail. So many silly things that could be fixed. Like the telephone for room service that sounds like they are underwater and so impossible to understand. It is just unnecessary frustration. Like the coffee cups in the room not being paired with the correct matching saucers so they slide around and spill.  Small but so simple.  
 
Occupancy was clearly low while we were there, which is a cause for concern. And it seems tourism across the island has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. But despite local economic challenges there is a global brand to preserve.  Perhaps merging the Anantara Kalutara into the adjacent Avani (already common ownership) and targeting a lower price point with lower expectations, is a solution worth considering.  
 
Perhaps we were just unlucky. But sadly we will not be using any Anantara again.","Seriously disappointing for an Anantara, multiple problems","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1006091499-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

他真的很认真也很负责，对每一个细节都照顾处理得很周到，并且他会一直持续关注事件后续的进展。虽然他不是经理，只是一个普通的工作人员，但他发自内心的热情的微笑，让我们本来不太愉快的居住增加了很好的体验！顺便说，这是一位非常有耐心的工作人员，希望酒店可以予以关注并且提拔！
但是遗憾的是，除了上面我提到的这位工作人员，其他的工作人员的服务态度都很好，但是执行力却很差。我的意思是他们会答应得快且笑容满面，但最终未解决我的问题。所以有意义吗？
酒店的沙滩和景观也非常的一般。所谓的“海景套房”，却完全没���海景！所以整体对于这次的入住，我们是不满意的。
我的电视机会自动开机的功能，直到最后一天我离开了酒店，却依然没有修复。而我，不得不每晚睡觉的时候强制关掉总的电源！
我要求更换枕头，而更换完的枕头却有很浓的尿骚味，这真的让我本来就已经疲惫不堪的身体感觉到更加的痛苦。
餐品的确很丰盛！但是即使我点杯咖啡的速度，都简直是令人捉急。最后一天我因为赶着离开，所以早餐时我提前40分钟（当我抵达餐厅时便要求点两杯拿铁）。但直到我最后离开餐厅时，吧台的工作人员在我再三催促下才匆忙为我打包。让我留下了最后一天离开前非常非常不好的体验。
First, I have to mention a staff member named ""Chathuka"".
He is really serious and responsible, taking care of every detail very carefully, and he will always keep an eye on the progress of the incident. Although he is not a manager, just an ordinary staff member, his warm smile from the bottom of his heart made our otherwise unpleasant stay add a good experience! By the way, this is a very patient staff, I hope the hotel can pay attention to and promote!
But unfortunately, except for the staff I mentioned above, the other staff have a good service attitude, but the execution is poor. I mean they would say yes quickly and with a big smile, but in the end they didn't solve my problem. So does it make sense?
The beach and view of the hotel are also very average. The so-called ""sea view suite"" has no sea view at all! Therefore, as a whole, we are not satisfied with this stay.
My TV would turn on automatically until the last day I left the hotel, but it still hadn't been fixed. I, on the other hand, have to force the power supply off every night when I go to bed!
I asked to replace the pillow, and the pillow after replacement had a strong smell of urine, which really made my already tired body feel more painful.
The food is really rich! But even the speed with which I can order a cup of coffee is a rush. On my last day, I was in a hurry to leave, so I was 40 minutes early for breakfast (and asked for two lattes when I arrived). But it wasn't until I finally left the restaurant that the bar staff, after much prodding from me, rushed to take out my coffee. It left me with a very, very bad experience before I left on my last day.","不太满意的住宿体验（I'm not very satisfied with the accommodation experience）","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r992755904-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The food choice and quality at the restaurants was pretty poor, the ambience lacking any real character. We ate at the buffet - dark and dingy with noise above of people playing pool. No atmosphere to speak of and the food was poor.

We also ate at the Asian restaurant which again was very dark and the food was just about okay, but lacking the wow factor.

We had planned to eat at the Italian restaurant on our last night but it was closed. It seems they operate a rotating availability without telling the customer, making it impossible to plan. It seems bizarre that they sell the hotel on the basis of having 3 restaurant options and then randomly reduce it to 2. 

Breakfasts were pretty average, with the usual interminable delay in getting tea delivered to the table - 20 minutes this morning, a new record! and no milk!

The pool areas are nice and the adult only pool is very pleasant. The sunbeds and towels all look like they could do with a refresh and service was patchy. One day we got water and ice creams, the next nothing at all.

The beach is nice although a bit of a trek from the adult pool area and the sand is coarse. 

Housekeeping was excellent- friendly and helpful.

Everything was fine initially—check-in, rooms, and amenities—until we hit the dinner time. With the hotel almost fully booked for the long weekend, the management and restaurant staff were utterly clueless about handling the crowd. We were forced to wait over 30 minutes just to get a table, which was beyond frustrating.

To make matters worse, the charges were significantly higher than those at other five-star hotels in Sri Lanka, yet the service was abysmal. Paying a premium price for such poor management is a joke. We had to endure an unacceptable wait just for a table. This level of service is completely unacceptable.

Breakfast was no better. We arrived early when it wasn’t too crowded, but by the time we finished, the restaurant was packed. I’ve stayed at various hotels, both bigger and smaller, on busy weekends, and never have I experienced such disorganization and delays.

And to top it all off, when we checked out, all we got was a pathetic verbal apology from the cashier. No one from management even bothered to step in and take responsibility. This hotel chain has proven to be a complete disappointment, and I will never stay at any of their properties again.","Might be a good hotel, but not when it's fully booked","2024-08","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r966600505-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Поэтому в этом отзыве я сравниваю данный отель с другими отелями Anantara и тем высоким уровнем сервиса, к которому они нас приучили.

Заключение: это худший отель сети Minor в котором мы были:
1. Посредине отеля приходит городская дорога, по которой с шумом проносятся машины и Тук -тук, и может пройти любой. Вы идете из ресторана отеля к своему номеру и каждый раз вы пересекаете эту дорогу, вас обступают сомнительные люди с предложением такси, Тук-Тук и прочих услуг, словно вы идете по базару. И это отель 5 звезд от которого вы ожидаете тишины и релаксации. Дверь вашего номера смотрит на эту дорогу так что утром вас будут будить весело проносящиеся на стоянку рядом Тук -туки или местные подростки из ближайшей деревни с гулом спешащие на пляж, где вы и будете отдыхать и купаться в их компании и под их восторженными взглядами. 
2. Пляж не принадлежит отелю. На пляже есть лежаки от отеля и охранник, но готовьтесь что по пляжу будут слоняться люди не относящиеся к отелю, глазеть на вас, предлагать вам различные услуги и всячески стараться способствовать вашему безмятежному отдыху. На пляже нет спасателей, наслаждайтесь купанием и тоните на ваше усмотрение. Если вы решите прогуляться по пляжу до соседнего отеля AVANI также принадлежащего Minor, готовьтесь увидеть дары моря: бревна, палки, грязь вынесенные морем,  которые никто не убирает, зачем, ведь пляж не принадлежит отелю, а значит зачем тратить деньги на его уборку ? 
3. Основной и взрослый бассейны очень маленькие. Анантара приучила нас что лежаков всегда больше чем людей и как только вы приходите, вам приносят полотенца, воду, меню бара и окружают заботой. Здесь все не так. Вокруг переполненного бассейна вы сначала будете сами бегать и искать лежаки, потом бегать за человеком с полотенцами, а потом за официантом с меню бара. Прочем в соседней AVANI персонал внимательный и все у бассейна работает так, как и должно быть в настоящей Anantara, к которой мы привыкли. 
4. Если вы пришли и сели за столик у бара или бассейна это не сигнал для персонала что к вам нужно подойти и предложить меню. Вам придется побегать и заявить о своих намерениях перекусить.
5. 2 раза у нас не убрались в номере к 3 часам дня и убрались только после напоминания. Никогда мы не встречали такого в других отелях сети.
6. Из хорошего хотелось бы отметить Ресторан Spice Traders, он  изумительный! Это гастрономическое удовольствие, но бронировать его нужно за 2 дня, если вы приехали на 2 дня можете не попасть.  
7. Итальянский ресторан полная противоположность.    

В заключении я не рекомендую тем кто уже отдыхал в отелях Anantara, останавливаться в данном отеле, так как вас может ждать разочарование.","Отзыв об Anantara Kulutara","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r947051972-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

This by far would be the lowest rated of the lot. Located in a not ideal area. Not a nice beach and the lagoon is not particularly beautiful either.
 Service, especially in the main building and main restaurant, is inadequate in relation to the standards of an Anantara resort. The restaurant is like a waiting room in a train station and you constantly feel like a volunteer in a kindergarten. ...... There is no question of relaxed dining in a luxurious ambience here. Photoshop has also done its job here with the official pictures. The quality and selection of the food is mediocre, especially compared to other hotels (we know what we are talking about as we were guests in 6 excellent 5 star hotels during our round trip). On top, food and drinks are totally overpriced (sometimes 3 times the price of better 5 star hotels in the country........Pizza Magaretha 18 US $.... with what justification remains a mystery to me. No value for money!
Maintenance on buildings are needed especially on the pool decks ……never saw  a 5 star hotel neither any anatara in this bad shape.
Housekeeping is not working properly as it tooks 3 days to remove black long hairs out of the shower, room etc. really not acceptable.
Fish smells from the head my regards to the poor management of the hotel….. totally overpriced hotel with poor facilities.
We are very disappointed with this Anantara Resort because it does not have the usual standard and totally overpriced........ Travel 174 km south to Tangalle and check at Anantara peace heaven ……..two waves collide..... a really really fantastic hotel which provides the original anantara standard.
May be the management from Anantara Kalutara should travel there as well to learn how a hotel will be managed.

Please don’t bother me with pre arranged standard answers or a even a Bot generated answer.","An average hotel pretending to be a luxury hotel","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r946446109-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The booking was made by my cousin and my bridesmaids and I were very excited for this weekend. 
When we arrived check-in was nice and the welcome dance was cool but it all went down hill from there. 

We were driven to our villa by Krish who was stopped by some tuk tuk drivers on the public road when he told them we were local they didn’t want to talk to us but he said they can still talk to us and almost encourage them to try and rip us off. The next morning we were bothered by the same tuk tuk Drivers. 

The villa was nice. The pool was really beautiful, but the master bedroom stank like sewer. There was a horrible stench coming from the bathroom in the master bedroom which infiltrated the entire room. There was also a note for a previous guest from the hotel left on our bed, and we had no welcome notes or appreciation or acknowledgment from the hotel. 

There was absolutely nothing to celebrate my bachelorette. When I was wearing my bride-to-be sash around the hotel staff would give me weird looks and we’re just totally shady and creepy the entire time. 

Service was painfully slow. We had to ask for water three times at breakfast. We also had to ask for tea, and when it finally did come, a staff member spilled the tea all over our table. 

The meals were mediocre at best and repetitive. There was not a big selection, and the entertainment was grotesquely lacking. 

Our experience was so bad! We needed first aid care on our night there and the hotel’s response time was despicable. They took over 15 minutes to get to us while one of us was bleeding and in need of medical attention. 

I would never come back to this hotel again, and I will have to do a bachelorette redo after this horrendous getaway.","Bachelorette Redo Needed","2024-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r933881058-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The positive: pool is great, breakfast and dinner was good and had nice variety.
The Negative: we stayed at Anantara resorts all over the world, this one by far is the worst, the resort is run like a 3 star hotel, yes everything you might need at a resort is there, but it's not what you would expect.
1- check-in experience: all the paid activities and dinner/lunch options were discussed at length, when I asked about what I paid for which is half board, I was told that I can use the normal restaurant, but of I want to experience fine dinning should go ahead and reserve at one of the a la carte restaurants.
2- there seemed to be a general feel to the resort that all guest requests are troublesome to staff members, i.e pool towels are always not available, reason given, the laundry didn't come yet. Room cleaning was done, but towels weren't replaced, and old ones were taken away, so after a full day outside of the resort with two small kids, we come back to the room and jump into the showers only to realize there are no towels. 30 mins later we get 1 towel for the 4 of us 
3- we booked a pool side room with a terrace, this wasn't cleaned from bird poo, and only after a couple of calls to guest relations a staff member came over, and just moped it.
4- on our last day we get a call to ask about check out timing, we replied with 12 as the standard checkout timing, the staff member noted that any minute after 12 we will be charged a full day. Which is fair I guess, but why would you say that to a guest that just spent 4 nights at your property.
5- 11 pm we get wake up by substantially loud banging noises from the next door room, we checked to see what's going on, and apparently the room was being cleaned by staff members, we asked for the noise to be kept at a minimum as both our kids were woken up by it. 40 mins later both staff members were still loudly on their phones and loudly moving furniture pieces around. This repeated on two nights, where we had to visit reception and complain for this to stop.

Overall, in my experience, this is a refurbished 3 star hotel, given the Anantara brand.

As a comparison we stayed at the Anantara in Tangalle on a previous trip to Sri Lanka, and absolutely loved every second we spent there.","Not an Anantara resort ","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r930899154-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

I am sorry that you were not happy with your stay at KK Beach. We have spoken to the staff and would like to respond accurately to your complaints.
1.	No TV in the room   You were booked into one of our entry level rooms, and there are no televisions – a fact that we have made clear to all agents etc. If that was a specific requirement of yours, then you should have made this clear to your agent when booking your holiday.
Because you had wanted to watch a sports programme, we offered you the choice of a brand new tablet, a laptop, or use of the only vacant room available for the period to watch the match. 
You chose to decline all offers.
2.	Upgrade Room offer.  Your husband enquired about upgrading to our Ocean Penthouse Suite and we gave him a hugely discounted rate.
Again you chose to decline the offer.

3.	Lack of storage. Sri Lanka is a tropical island, and very humid, our closets are open spaces, because if you have drawers and cupboard doors, this will lead to them becoming musty and a build-up of mould very quickly - it is important to have airflow.  Again, if having drawers for your clothes was an essential requirement, this should have been made clear by you when booking your holiday. The Duty Manager offered additional coat hangers for your clothes, and again this was declined by you.

4.	Noise disturbance. Regrettably there was a musical show on two consecutive nights approximately 900 metres away from the hotel. This is something that is TOTALLY out of our control. After calling the Duty manager at half past midnight on the second night, he made an inspection of the room next to yours that was vacant that night, and yes, he could hear music, but it was not that loud.  The Duty manager then called the local police station and he got them to enforce an end to the music show at 1.30am – more than that there is nothing we could do. The next morning the Duty Manager went around the tables at breakfast talking to the other guests, none of whom had been disturbed by the music. For you to say the room was vibrating is an exaggeration.
Your request the following day of a free upgrade for the next two nights we could not agree to, particularly when nobody else had raised a complaint. However, because we have a good relationship with the agent through whom you made your booking, we did agree to offer you a complimentary dinner that night, at which point you informed the staff that you had booked another hotel and were checking out there and then. 

We have tried very hard to ameliorate the situation, but it seems you were not to be placated. Especially in light of the fact that no other guest made a complaint about the noise disturbance, we cannot agree to a refund.  

Yours sincerely,
George Cooper

We were booked for 4 nights and decided we were sick of complaining and tired of being ignored so we left after 2 days and they refused to either upgrade us  us or refund us for the 2 days we didn’t use. Eventually when we were leaving and had loaded our cases into the taxi we were offered a free dinner if we stayed ! I told the manager we had found a quieter hotel and it was too little too late !  I asked him to refund the complimentary dinner from one of the 2 meals we had already had but he would not so we paid for that too. 
The travel agent is still trying to get back the money for the 2 nights we have not used as the hotel is not cheap and we are now in another hotel and paying twice. It’s really disappointing and awful customer service they have said sorry about the horrendous partying but I have had enough of trying g to reason with them at 1.45 in the morning as this has ruined our holiday and our whole experience.","Terrible management and customer service","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r936981213-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Misunderstanding of between the rider apps drivers and Local TUK TUK drivers it is impossible for Rider app drivers to come and pick up the Guests from the hotel. It is out of our hand. However When the guests need the transport from the hotel , We provide it from the hotel transport on reasonable price. Therefore if you asked from any reception staff they should have helped you.

Any way TUK TUK service of the area out of our management. I hope you can understand the fact,

Primary concern was -  If you call for transportation through ride apps - the drivers are scared to come pick you - because there are tuk tuks outside the hotel who will apparently beat them. Raised concern to hotel. Staffs response was its not their responsibility. These drivers parked at their hotel entrance have no affiliation with them. They asked me to either pay the transportation at the hotel gates - at higher rates - or walk out of their hotel on foot with my luggage if I didn't think it was right.  

When I pointed out - this affects their guests directly and is their responsibility as well to an extent. The staf literally pointed me to to the exit.

Удобное местоположение. Приветливый персонал. Организуют тематические праздники. Территория хорошо организована, прекрасный вид, особенно на закате.
В ресторане местная кухня хорошая, цены адекватные.
Небольшой, но вполне хороший спортзал (для меня это большой плюс). Есть бильярд.
Завтраки нормальные, кофе не очень.
WiFi работал хорошо, устойчиво по всей территории отеля, скорость нормальная.

Не понравилось · Номер, в котором жили, не соответствует заявленной звездности (заявлено 5 звезд). Номера изношены. Три раза по три дня кондиционер тек, вода лилась в номер и в середине стояла лужа. Сам кондиционер старый, потеки происходят вероятно регулярно, о чем свидетельствуют подтеки на стене у него. Индикатор температуры вообще висел на шнуре, торчащем из кондея.
Убираются не очень аккуратно, по углам, чуть скрытым местам пыль.
В сильный дождь протекал потолок в ванной.
Полотенца меняли через раз, два раза пришлось самому ходить менять. Полотенца только по одному большому на проживающего и одно маленькое, толи для рук, толи для ног, его ни разу не меняли.
Первый раз столкнулся с таким, что в ванной лежали три коробочки шапочек для душа, две их которых были пустыми (не очень то они нужны были, просто неожиданно).
Мыло кусковое положили одно в начале, больше не меняли.
Стояли емкости для шампуня и кондиционера в ванной пустые, после того, как пару раз сказали об этом, наполнили на третий день.
Заказывали ��ду в номер, грязную посуду на следующий день не убрали, поставил за пределы номера, и там она долго простояла.
В ресторане европейское меню делают посредственно.
Возможно нашей семье не повезло с номером.
Еще раз обращаю внимание, что сравнивал из ожидания и личного опыта, что гостиница 5 звезд.

However, I was compelled to write one after seeing the way the property manager responded to comments made by two of my family members (thus just one dot). I've given quoted few lines from a previous replies from the manager. It's up to readers decide the truth.

I have to admit that the front office staff was very friendly and supportive. This hotel has no access to beach or sea, the most important factor in the area. Hence they direct guests to another hotel at the beach. Unfortunately there is no communication between two hotels and guests will experience two different conditions from those two.

Stewards at the restaurant didn't bother to take our order and we had to wait over 20mins for a steward to give the order. That's after walking up to them over four time.

""At your arrival you refused given car keys to valet parking then security had to involve as parking got blocking from your cars""
- It wasn't valet parking. We simply parked in front of the hotel. We refused to give car keys because of the rude manner your security officer treated us and all vehicles were from the same group. Most importantly right to hand over key of a personal vehicle remains with the owner of the vehicle and you cannot force to do that.

""What had happened that you have brought alcohol bottles from outside and drinking in our hotel restaurant and parting- singing of 15 pax group so you understand it is disturbing house guests so beach house management had to involve to make you understand that as we had complained from our hotel guests""
- Alcohol we consumed at hotel restaurant was purchased from your bar and yes we consumed our alcohol at the room balcony initially and in the room after night fall as we did not want to disturb other guests. This was permitted by your hotel front office staff. The group consisted of three generations from the same family members and everything was wrapped up before midnight. All this time hotel played music at the restaurant from a large speakers & ours wasn't loud as you've described here. This is simply a baseless accusation by the manager to convince readers that we were disturbing others. 

After all bitter experiences at this property, we feel that this is how this hotel treat local guests to convey the massage that we are not welcomed at their property.

There're many more to write but please read all responses given by the hotel to negative reviews. They itself speak the truth about the attitude of the manager of the hotel. The same manger who was shouting and commanding his own staff at the restaurant during the breakfast. 

Yes, my other family members informed the hotel that this will go up on various forums after settling all bills both rooms and considerable amount for extra services we obtained. That's purely due to dissatisfaction from the moment we parked the car to checking out and for anything in return. 

So far the worst experience I've experienced from all hotels I've been to internationally.","Bad service and attitude","2022-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r827863996-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The food is aweful at breakfast -DO NOT GET THE BREAKFAST INCLUDE PRICE- service is so poor it is almost inconceivable.  Everyday was a challenge to acquire clean towels. They have two pools yet they only give you one towel per person.  Shower and pool- you only get one towel. The decks are falling apart there are nails sticking out everywhere - my son got a bad cut on one of the loose nails sticking out  of the deck and instaed of the hotel staff helping him with the cut they choose  questions my wife as to how it happened so the wouldn't get sued or bad press as my wife was helping my son clean his wound... What a joke this place is. They offer a complementary cart ride to the other sister hotels, but you are better to walk it's much faster and less frustrating then waiting for the cart to arrive.

We are sorry that you had this isolated experience with us. We are also disappointed that some aspects of your experience did not live up to the expectations. Thank you for taking the time to write a review. You have already told us that you have to damage the hotel good image by writing a fake review. This is 5th   review you put on the same matter so we have to reply the same over and over again as we never discriminate against Sri Lankans. 
 
 We afford and treat the equal right to all citizens where NO person shall, on the grounds of race religion, language or anyone such grounds, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition concerning access to our hotels. As you mentioned we know very well that domestic tourists have stood by our industry through difficult times and it’s our citizens who have supported our industry right throughout. 

At the same time, I would like to let you know as you are domestic travelers, have to ensure that the tourist property is well taken care of decant policies so you have to adhere to the hotel's requirements and behave as brand ambassadors for the country among other foreign travelers in the hotel. We don’t want to make you quite embarrassed by showing CCTV footage on social media to show how you had behaved that day. Even we got many complaints from our house guest you were disturbing them and you did not have well-mannered decent behavior so we had to make you understand that.  
The reason behind writing these all reviews is since you were refused to enter at Thaproban beach house due to that fact you wanted a table for the large group after bringing a box full of alcohol bottles, soft drinks and bites. Some of you were not even properly dressed. Most of you were with swimming attire in the dining area as you know we have certain policies and well-mannered decent behavior in reputed place among decent people. 
    
We constantly work towards understanding the individual preferences of our valued partners. Thank you for your suggestions which we do note for improvement.

However, I do feel that would be guests and fellow travellers should have realistic expectations of what to expect.

Firstly, given the condition of the room we stayed in this certainly is NOT A 5* HOTEL

The room initially appeared fairly clean but upon looking closer the room was worn, tired and did feel slightly grubby because of this. The big cobwebs in the corners of the main room and bathroom speaks volumes about the level of cleanliness as did the old bedsheets which had a hole in them and were ‘grey’ rather than White. 

A generally ‘rough finish’ to the room
(See photos) it appears to have been an old building which has been painted a bit.

Positives:

Nice lobby area, good location only 5-10 walk from unawatuna beach, great view of the sunset form the rooftop bar, two separate pool areas with one that feels like a private pool for 3/4 rooms

Negatives:

No safe in room initially, we asked for one and one was brought to the room but not bolted down and could be carried out (unlikely but still!) Poor aircon, Loud fan, The sofa was stained,  the ‘fresh towels’ were stained as were the pillow cases, grubby and generally very worn feel to the room. Slow bar service and although they advertise ‘premium sprits’ the bottles are all empty and I have a suspicion that the ones that are full are not actually the proper branded liquor.

I’m a reasonable man and understand you get what you pay for but at over £200 per night I expected more… a lot more! At least a certain level of cleanliness, a decent finish to the room, clean towels, and decent bedsheets not ones they were stained and with holes in.

If you are going to stay here then you should be paying no more than £70-£80 a night as it’s a 2*/3* maximum.

We are indeed very concerned about the comment you posted regarding your stay at our hotel. 

If you had brought the shortcomings to our notice immediately without  packing your luggage and coming to the reception saying you are checking out and need the room payment refunded, we would have attended to your problem straight away  as the comfort of our guests is of paramount importance to us. 

More so as we have quite a lot of honeymooners choosing our hotel as a romantic getaway. 
However this is the first complaint of this nature from such guests.  Usually they're very much engrossed in each other to hardly notice other things,  but comment on how wonderfully they were treated by all the staff and the special attentions bestowed on them.
We hope that everything else is well with you and wish you a happy wedded life.

Room is not sound proof, we could hear absolutely everything that was happening outside: steps from the hallway, people talking at the pool, lobby music and phone ringing from the next room. We had a difficult time falling asleep. As if this is not enough, there was an extra window in our room with only light curtain on it hence the sun woke us up really early.
Hotel stuff was over welcoming and keep asking us spa treatments which we didn't wanted.

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us as we strive to improve with each and every day.
 
We are extremely overwhelmed on your comment on our luscious food prepared with utmost care and love and praised by many of our guests. However our sincere apology for not pleasing your palate.
Both Chefs and service are willingly accommodates special meal/dilatory requests in such we would have definitely come up with off menu suggestions i.e. vegetarian options if we could have been informed. Our professional chefs are keen on food quality and temperatures and surprisingly it was the only complaint we received with regards to Christmas Eve Gala Dinner.
Also clearly letting you know that we are a well reputed hospitality brand in country with almost 30 years of history so we never raise funds from guests for staff welfare (party). And also our guests would never praise us if we do not offer a great service (guest comments).
We offered your baby a pasta as always prioritize kids even though you were way early to Gala Dinner. Also we opened you the entire bread section instead of some bread in a basket, which you appreciated but surprisingly complaining.

However, our experience of the hotel & the services provided was anything but that. We paid USD 430 per day for our room and for food and with this amount of money we expected a 5 star experience. What we got was at best a 2 star experience. Let me try to summarize point wise:

1) On Christmas eve there was a mandatory dinner (USD 50/person) and the food was cold and limited. It seemed that the hotel was trying to collect this money to fund a party for their staff who were least interested in making sure that the guests were having a good time. The staff was busy trying to have the guests quickly finish the dinner so that they could start with their own party
2) My mother is vegetarian and the only items available on the menu for her were french fries, a vegetable burger, a vegetable pasta, a vegetable pizza and a vegetable wrap
3) There was one member of the staff, who seemed like the owner of the property who always seemed to be eating his food with the guests. The staff too were busy taking food for him instead of ensuring that the guests were having a good time
4) The service was downright abysmal - we ordered a pasta along with bread and the bread came after we had finished the pasta. This is just one example of the lack of professionalism. The staff also did not understand basic instructions in English
5) When we were checking out we were repeatedly told that we are half an hour late and we should leave ASAP. It would have been brilliant if the same level of urgency was shown when we were checking in when we were made to wait for an hour
6) There were limited channels on the Television (10 approximately) and the Wi-Fi was erratic
7) One evening the barbeque grill was being done below our room and the smoke completely filled the room. It took a couple of hours for the smoke to clear
8) The hotel is at the end of a busy & narrow road and is approximately 1km away from the beach
9) The bathroom had no hangars/pegs and the door did not close properly 

You cannot be charging USD 400+ per day and give this level of service. We had spent the first 3 days of our trip in Taj Bentota which had similar prices but the level of hospitality was exceptional. I would urge all people who are looking to book a room in this hotel to look elsewhere since the prices do not reflect the level of hospitality.  ","The only thing 5 star about this hotel were the rates","2019-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r735819207-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for writing to us following your stay with us. We would like to make a point that this review was submitted to the wrong property as the room number 107 is in our other wing which is Thaproban Pavilion Resort and Spa.

However your feedback is extremely valuable to us as we strive to improve with each and every day.
 
Please accept our sincere apology with regards to bathroom amenities which were not there on your arrival, some amenities are also provided on request such as shaving kit. The kettle socket is right next to the television and within the reach. However the trainee room attendant was unable to identify it as it was partially covered by the TV.

Regular pest controlling is done to keep the pests to a minimal but it was an unfortunate breach of the bench mark due to location as we are located right next to thick vegetation.  Please rest assured that we will take necessary actions to prevent any such future occurrence. Our housekeeping team is already working on this as to seal the particular areas of pest entering the bathroom.

Breakfast buffet depends on house count (in all hotels). However the set menu offers a greater selection and our chefs are always willingly assist with off menu requests.
Our heartiest gratitude for all your comments on our staff members and will be definitely conveyed the same with management appreciation.
Thank you again for sharing your sincere thoughts and will be looking forward to welcome you back.

It was an A La carte menu. We ordered a Lagoon prawn curry, chilli Crab Linguine a long with three other dishes....as it was 5 of us. The first disappointment was that they said they didn't have the crab for the linguine as mentioned in the menu but that they will substitute it with prawns. I was ok with that, and went ahead and placed the order.
But alas! When my dish arrived it was not even prawns but shrimp, that they had substituted. So for a dish described as chilli Crab Linguine priced at Rs1450 they served me the linguine with literally 10-15 shrimp!!! It was day light robbery and a complete rip off!!! And the taste was absolutely bland. The shrimp was not marinated adequately and was not tossed in adequate amounts of spices and garnishing as expected, according to the menu description.
Then came the second disappointment. My husband ordered the Lagoon prawn curry - the menu stated that it was going to be accompanied by country rice and a salad. But alas! When the above was served it was accompanied by a small portion of rice, 3 pieces of papadam, lunu miris and chutney!!! This Lagoon prawn curry was priced at Rs3650. Lunu miris, papadam and chutney are mere rice pullers, and are not considered even as accompaniments or side. The taste was the worst!!! We Sri Lankan s know what a typical prawn curry tastes like. At this hotel the, the prawn tasted bland....there was no coconut curry flavour to it at all. It seemed like they had boiled the prawn in water and added it to a pre cooked curry and heated it and served! It was absolutely disappointing.
Being Sri Lankan s and in the hotel and travel trade we are very much in touch with how the food industry works in our country. We take great pride in the signature Sri Lankan dishes like the Lagoon prawn curry. These people have completely down graded this dish. They should have thought twice before serving such a dish prepared at such a low cost and served at such a high price to a local client.
An absolutely disappointing experience at Thaproban Pavilion waves!","The food was putrid!","2019-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r667124979-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Ayubowan!

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. I was truly disappointed to read about your experience and would like to offer my sincere apologies for the discomfort and frustration you encountered during your stay with us.

It is clear that we fell far short of both your expectations and the standards we set for ourselves at Sun Siyam Pasikudah. What you described regarding the cleanliness, room condition, and the welcome experience is unacceptable, and I am very sorry that this was your impression of our resort.

Your feedback has been shared with the relevant teams, and immediate steps are being taken to address the issues you highlighted—from housekeeping and maintenance to the general presentation of our facilities. We take these matters seriously, and your comments will help guide improvements as we work to ensure such oversights do not happen again.

While it is unfortunate that we did not have the opportunity to turn things around during your stay, we truly regret that your final days in Sri Lanka were not the relaxing experience you had hoped for.

Thank you again for your candid feedback.

Warm regards,
Arshed Refai

Of course it is not crap but not what you would expect for a 5 stars and over 150$ a day in  country where the average wage is about 300$ a month. 

The main disappointment is that you can’t swim in the sea. There is a small lagoon on the beach that face the hotel. This leads to having water under the knees and a lot of dead corals that prevent you from walking with bare foot. 
Plenty of hotels on the other side of the bay like the CALM hotel for example. Have a look on google and you can see it clearly. 

So you’re left with the swimming pool which is nice and large but of course it is disappointing. 

Outdoor bathroom is extremely large but a bit useless and there is no blind meaning that you can expect early rise which is not what you would expect for resting. 

Amenities are terrible. Certainly cheap but it is refilled with the cheapest possible shampoo. Clearly not Hermès as in Sofitel or Bolton as in Shangri-La ;)

Air conditioning is stopping every hour. They claimed it was an electricity supply issue but you would expect that a 5 stars hotel would have invested in a generator. When it stopped it makes a specific ring tone to wake you up :). Anyway at some point It is to warm. 

Food and drinks are extremely overpriced. 

Breakfast is ok but far from 5 stars absolutely not to the level you would expect. 

Very nice ocean suite. 
Staff is nice but management is disgraceful. 

So if you are used to guest houses you will love it. If you are used to 5 stars and have some expectations this hotel will fall short.

We will make it short:
- Grand Beach Pavillion : this is not in any circumstance a 5 star accommadation. Here is why: it is in a very poor condition. The roof in the bathroom are falling apart. The light does not work. There are no minibar and the fridge is warm. No coffemaker and it is in general dirty both inside and terrace and pool. Also many ants and other bugs inside the villa. Bathroom, not nice, it was very dirty! Not a good sign.
- Staff: We tried to give feedback on the villa. It took three hours for roomservice to come when we had ants and bugs. Also the management wouldn't listen when we tried to communicate.
- Food: POOR! We made a mistake and booked half board. It was buffet for every meal, and especially dinner was bad.

The views from the infinity pool out to the ocean are second to none. And if you want a few quiet, relaxing days then this is the place to be. 

There are a few things that aren’t necessarily bad but you should know before booking

- the rooms are called “ocean” rooms, however that seems to mean just facing in the general direction of the ocean not looking  on to the ocean.

- the toilet and shower are in a private area of the room but outside! Therefore when showering after a hot day or doing your other business you’re in a very hot environment

- the place was very very empty when we visited in early July, almost eerily empty and made us feel slightly uncomfortable. 

Then for the things that led to my rating. We only stayed 2 nights and had to walk to reception 4 separate times to complain about something wrong with our room (because the phone didn’t work to call them)

- when we arrived they had written welcome on our bed with flowers and leaves. A nice touch if it didn’t come with a bunch of ants as well. Had to ask for the linen to be changed

- linen was changed but ants prevailed in the battle. New solution was to leave a bottle of RAID in our room

- the power decided to just cut out around 6am one morning when we were sleeping leaving us to wake up to a hot room 

- and then the fourth was early one morning Gardner’s were trimming trees outside our room (fair enough) but for the better part of a day left the clippings on our footpath until I asked them to be cleaned up 

Should also note that even when the power worked the air conditioning was fighting a losing battle it desperately needed to be replaced

Additionally, I need to mention the staff. The reception staff really needs to improve their English skills - most of what I asked of them had to be repeated several times (expect this in a local guest house, not a 5 star resort). And the F&B staff is very inattentive. Took 3 requests over 15 minutes at breakfast to get a cup of coffee, and you can lay by the pool for hours without being waited on.

Overall I believe there are other just as beautiful resorts in the area where you will get better value for money, Sun Aqua needs to lift its game","A few stars short of 5","2018-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r593662335-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

And no, I would never ever recommend this hotel or would ever come back. Let's start with my experiences and well meant feedback:

The front desk: very friendly and some of the staff there speak good english and give reasonable information. Some though have no idea what they're talking about. 

The rooms: the first impression was very good. Big rooms, nice furniture, big bed. Bathroom is also very big but old. Plus: it's only half covered by a roof. One half is open. We asked right away if we had to expect mosquitos etc... ""no, don't worry"".... weeeeell, there were a lot of mosquitos, and bugs and that made us go to the bathroom at night with no lights on. That's just a no go.

Room service: one of the few good things. They cleaned our room twice a day very properly and were friendly.

Beach: and now read carefully. If you're going to Passikudah for a beach holiday, DONT GO TO SUN AQUA. You cannot swim at the ""beach"" there is a huge reef with thousands of corals which make it impossible to swim. Other rewievs said, that 200 meters away was a nice beach. NO THERE ISN'T. there's only the public beach with 100 locals swimming in their clothes and no sunbeds or shade. Also it's dirty. Very dirty! So much litter.
 After the public beach, the nicer beaches start. But again no sunbeds, shade, umbrellas. Only hotels and it's impossible to spend more than an hour in the hot sun. 

The pool: ok. So no beach but a nice pool. The pool is nice indeed. The sunbeds on the other hand are just disgusting. Is is so hard to replace old and used sunbeds with new ones? 

The restaurant: extremely expensive and I'm not exaggerating. At first you think the prices are quite ok (although compared to Sri Lanka's average income still too much) but then you'll find the ""small print"". They charge you 10% service tax plus 15% government tax which made our stay extremely expensive. 
I usually don't mind paying much money if the service and food are good. But that wasn't the case in Sun Aqua. In fact, there wasn't a single night without complaints. 
For example: they offer a lot of wine, which is actually quite good (they charge you 25% government tax for the wine btw). But everytime we had ordered a bottle of wine, they either didn't have it, they brought the wrong bottle or it was way too warm (white wine) which leads to my next point-

the service: i've never experienced such an incompetent service and I've seen a lot. That's not the fault of the staff but the management HAS to work on that point if they want to compete with other hotels in the area. The staff really has to improve their english skills! There were so many misunderstandings because of the lack of the language. Also, they have to be more present. Many times when people were lying at the pool, nobody came and offered drinks. We had to go to the bar and wait extremely long for our drinks. One time, the crows found a bag of chips at the pool, openend it and made a HUGE mess. None of the staff thought they were responsible and another hotel guest cleaned the mess and told the staff (there were two staff members standing around the corner doing nothing!!!!). Again the management has to work on that!!! Please train and instruct your staff properly. How should they know how (in my case) spoiled Europeans should be treated. I paid A LOT of money and got so little in return.:( 
The last three days, we had dinner at The Calm Hotel because the Sun Aqua only provided a small Sri Lanka Buffet which was boring and not good. The food at the Calm felt like heaven every time we were there. 

The 7 days felt like years especially because there's no infrastructure whatsover in Passikudah, which is not the hotel's fault. However I regret that I spent my holidays, money and time at the Sun Aqua. It was a  disappointment and I really don't know how the hotel got 5* and so many good reviews. If you want a nice holiday in Passikudah, I can recommend the Maalu Maalu where we spent one night. 

My last words: dear Sun Aqua, please read my feedback and don't just write the text you always write. Please think about my points and instruct your staff. And also please reduce your prices in the restaurant-they're ridiculous. We pay the same in Germany and get a lot more quality!","Expensive hotel with extremely incompetent staff","2017-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r518027196-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

I stayed with my wife in early July, and gotta say this must be the 8th mystery of the world. How in the hell did this hotel get a 5 star rating?

I should be honest and say the building itself is quite impressive. Very spacious, newly built. The good side stops there.

Closer inspection and actual stay revealed so much short coming that even my heavily discounted room rate seemed expensive. After one night (not even one night actually, within 16 hours), I checked out immediately even though the management flatly declined request for refund. I still thought it was worth saving my holiday vacation elsewhere than stay here because i couldn't get a refund. A right choice indeed.

Ok, so let me take you through the experience I had from the beginning. I was given a room at the second floor, where they claim it is a beach suite in the reservation site. But, no this is not a beach suite from other REAL 5 star establishment standard. No view of the beach at any angle. In fact covered by buildings in the front.

So the first image of the room seemed quite nice. Very spacious, high ceiling and quite huge room. (I am guessing they are calling this an all-suite-resort because of the room size, but they have no idea how to manage a suite really.). Outside toilet and bath/shower also seemed quite nice at first glance.

Now, as I start unpacking I start noticing all the worn downs and all the cheap 'money saving' attempts that seem so obvious. First the sunbeds are all torn apart, and the towels are used for so long and often they are quite rough. 

Amenities are half Molton Brown (Loofah, Grooming Kit etc)  and half Sun Aqua (shampoo, shower gel) brand. This is a speculation but it seemed pretty odd they would have different brands of amenities, and after more observations of how this hotel was being so cheap, I came to conclude they might have actually tried to save costs by mixing whatever stock they had left from the previous amenities instead of chaning the entire amenities to the new brand. But anyway, not the important part.

I was surprised the hotel would leae the torn up sunbed as it is and receive guests here. Again, it came to be explained that the management simply DOES NOT CARE or HAVE A VERY LOW STANDARD in service quality. (See Picture). Also noticed the Key Cards had been so worn down it looked like it wasnt ever changed since the beginning of this hotel. The shower booth had strong sewage smell coming out of the sewers as well. The Bathtub was also worn down, and the water tab handles were broken but operatable.

Next very important thing I noted was the lack of cold air from the A/C. And the A/C started spewing out disgusting smell, like sewage smell. We thought it was the hot air outside and the room would cool if we left it on for a few hours. turns out at night, the room is hotter than outside !!! Can you believe that? When complained, the hotel offered to change rooms so we did, because we were not gonna get any sleep there with so much heat in the room and the mattresses.

When we changed rooms, we noticed that the A/C was not any better. Now what we noticed was that the A/C was a cheap chinese maker not ever heard of. Something like 'Cool Power' or something, and must fall drastically short in performance to more famous branded A/Cs like Samsung or LG or other brands. (The hotel we moved to had Panasonic or Philips i cant remember, but had no problem with A/C! So yeah, it's not us, the hotel A/C was really that bad.)

Because I couldnt sleep, we moved back to our rooms, at least it had 9 hours of A/C on despite the room still being hotter than outside (which was night time with sea breeze), and smelling awful (but get used to the smell). I looked through the reviews wondering how people missed all these bad things. Then, I saw one review saying how the hotel is only concerened with making money. After that, I came to realize and started noticing that everything in this hotel was CHEAP. Lack of management due to being CHEAP, despite having built a good building out here.

Another HUGE MAJOR problem comes from the fact that the beach in this hotel had too much rocks and corals and made it dangerous to swim in it. You might be able to walk in it with slippers but thats it, you had risk of being cut if you got caught by the waves.

And the POOL! Oh my god, i never saw anything like it. Another review posted in 2016 said the pool was infested with bugs. So we having not slept much, woke up early in the morning to check it out. And  wow, (check picture) the pool IS INDEED VERY MURKY and INFESTED WITH SO MUCH INSECTS!!!  I've never seen pools so poorly managed like this, not even in 4 star hotels I've been. When this was brought to attention to the RM, I was shocked that he saw no problem with it and said its only natural. I will tell you all, this is NOT NATURAL. IT MEANS THE HOTEL IS NOT CLEANING THE POOL WELL ENOUGH. Other hotel I moved to, THE CALM had pristine clean pools, and obviously no bugs! 

Everything I can expect as common service seemed like a luxury in this poor excuse of a resort. So we decided to check out the next morning, only because no one could accomodate our needs at the time of night when we initially wanted to get out. The supposed Residential Manager came in to work late, (more than an hour later than the hotel staff had initially advised) poorly dressed, with even worse attitude.

The manager only repeated that it was 'natural' how their hotel was in such a poor state, and 'no refund' was possible even for the nights we did not stay. I had a bad  experience in one of the more famous resort hotels, and at least they had a courtesy to refund the nights I did not stay, but here, its a different level. I will make full disclosure, the management did offer an upgrade but I decliend after seeing so much signs of neglect and uncaring enviornment. Just did not think it was worth wasting my vacation time for a little bit of money.

So I moved to the Calm in the morning without the refunds, but it was a much better decision as I had a splendid time in The Calm. The beaches at that part of the hotels are much better (check the google map to see what I am talking about)

Anyway, its a long review, but this hotel is definitely NOT 5 STAR HOTEL. If you think its just worth it staying here because its cheap, think again. In this case, bad management is worse than bad facilities.

If anybody asks me, I would tell them to stay the heck away from this place.","A ridiculous resort, quite insulting.","2017-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r510290649-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The location is really amazing and quiet, but they could do much better:

Good points:
-	Room with great design, everything worked very good (lights, AC…)
-	Private plunge pool in open air bathroom
-	Public pool nice and clean
-	Room very clean
-	Maintenance staff very fast and friendly
-	Cleaning staff very friendly 
-	Good fruits on breakfast buffet
-	Very qiet and beautiful beach

The sea in front oft he hotel is very shallow and full of dead corals – not good to swim, but i would never review that bad, i informed myself in prior. A short walk out oft he hotel is a public beach thats nice to swim.

Bad points:
-	No clear service level: ONE day (out of 7) – somebody got pool towels to he beach for us.
Others got flowers upon arrival – not for us, even when we were on honeymoon (informed Altamish, the reservation manager in prior!)
Somtimes the bottles and the glasses at the beach were collected – mostly not
-	Ugly toilets at the pool, very stinky
-	Pool towels and sunbed pillows very dirty and damaged
-	No reliable front desk – Example: Altamish told us that we can rent a scooter, next day we were told that there is no scooter rental availiable in all the area

Restaurant(!!!!!):
-	Just 500ml plastic water bottles – so much waste, NEW ZEALAND butter and STRAWBERRY jam in small plasic containers, less homemade stuff
-	Restaurant disappointing vor vegans: We informed the hotel in prior that my wife is vegan, got info from Altamish that it is no problem – BUT: They all have no idea about vegan!!!
MEAT in VEGETARIAN sring rolls, no vegan soup availiable, staff not creative what they can do
-	Less local stuff availialbe: King coconut: just three pieces for all guests in one week, no hoppers, no rotis (when not on breakfast buffet), even one day no curd/lassi – it was end of high season, wouldnt complain when we were the only guests
-	The restaurant staff speaks very bad english, many missunderstandings (and waiting…) and they dont remember anything about food preferences, room number
-	When you go tot he buffet, the crows fly on your table and geht wat they can, other places have security with slingshots to avoid that (no craw did hurt!!!)

We tried to give the staff our feelings and feedback, but nobody did listen to us, they always wanted to inform somebody, but nothing changed. We would not stay there again – can reccomend the Uga bay, they have an amazing staff and really good food.","Beautiful hotel with bad restaurant and staff","2016-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r417329435-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Of course, that's every business' goal, but some try to make the experience perfect for each and every client.

The good first: 

-Reception staff were very friendly and nice. 
-While the buffet was boring and unappetizing, the Ala Carte food was good.

Now all the issues:

-Pool was infested with boatman bugs. Thousands of them. These bugs eat algae, and that's the only reason they'd inhabit a pool. Water looked really murky at night by the pool lights.

-Pool is black. As a personal preference, I don't like that.

-Pool and beach deck chairs were very dirty and many were broken.

-The first frog we found in the closet was cute. My husband caught it in a laundry bag and chucked it outside. But the second one we found...it was just weird.

-Room hygiene was low, and the fixtures in the bathroom looked worn out. Some were rusty.

-Plunge pool in room with no filter on. Fine film of dirt at the top.

- Loud 70's and 80's music was blaring loudly from a disco-looking place down under the restaurant, and was very annoying during dinner. To be fair, upon complaining, the staff somehow put a stop to it.

-Maany members of taff poorly trained and do not speak English well.

- Due to all the above factors, especially the pool infestation, my family wanted to leave, as we didn't want to ruin our beach vacation. We explained the situation to the management in a very reasonable manner. They refused to refund the money, and insisted on offering us the Grand Pavillion, as it had its own, larger pool. The pool was filthy, and there were bugs in it too. We declined politely,  and asked for a refund of the remaining two nights. After much drama, and going back and forth with management in the Maldives, they agreed to refund 40% of the amount. A truly world class hotel would not allow guests to walk out unhappy, but they just did not care enough.. Being a world class hotel seems to take second place to making money.","Amateurs.

Good points first then all the bad ones:

Right on the beach. Caveat - disappointing beach, swimming normally difficult due to broken coral (a remanent from the Boxing Day tsunami, apparently) and while we visited Jellyfish everywhere. All up and down the East Coast.

Great pool. Warm, almost too warm. 

Really impressive design of main buildings, restaurant and rooms that were spread out with a very, very relaxed and spacious feel. 

Rooms were thoughtfully planned and super spacious. Really nicely done. Huge and I had a private plunge pool.

Food was actually really good. Solid effort by the chef.

The hotel provides accomodation for drivers. Well done.

Now for the bad news, and there was plenty:

I arrived at 6pm, 4 hours after check in time. I had beach suite.  The room was a storage shed ! Pillows pilled high everywhere, even in the SHOWER ! Ironing board and iron left on the bed. The outdoor table was inside with all the mouldy cushion stacked on top. Footprints over the remaining cushions. Towels strewn about.  Long hairs left all over the floor and bed. It was bad.

Totally unacceptable for any hotel let alone a 5 star resort. I expressed my unhappiness and was told i could wait 10 minutes for the room to 'be ready' ! I did mention it was already 6pm, right ???!!! 

I refused and demanded a new room. On the 3rd attempt after threatening to leave for another hotel, my request was granted. The excuse was, 'oh sorry. It seems the room wasnt prepared in time and must have been a mistake' ! No kidding....

Moved to the next room. Beautiful room it was too. BUT - the airconditioner was broken (needed to be fixed 3 times), the plunge pool filter continued to breakdown constantly until fixed the 3rd time. The electricity didnt work, so no lights. This required 2 efforts to remedy. There was mould over the sofa and cushions. The cupboard light didnt work. There was hair on the floor snd in the bed, again. 

They forgot to provide towels in the room, too.

The toilet leaked from the bottom all over the toilet floor. I slipped once and fell into the glass wall... lucky i didnt slice myself to death. The worst part was that the toilet leaked when flushed... you can guess what that means, right?????.... !!!

2 further attempts and a patch-up glue gun attempt failed to fix this for my entire stay. So, instead i just put a mat down and had it changed each day.... gross.

An ant infestation needed 2 attempts and a spraying campaign to irradicate - well almost.... It would have helped if housekeeping didnt eat and leave dropped food in the room !!!

Several, and i mean multiple, frustrating attempts to have everything at least satisfactorily remedied by the stand-in Manager came to nothing until the last night.

He didnt seem to understand and really didnt make any effort, apart from parading the house-keeping staff and Housekeeping manager before me to apologise, consistently.

I became very accustomed to the fix-it guy in my room.....

After all this, they even had the audascity to charge me for 2 extra bottles of water !

The only thing that was offered was a birthday cake (for breakfast) and they didnt charge me for 2 glasses of wine.

The staff left the previous evenings glasses, plates and leftovers out overnight by the pool until the next morning meaning the crows had a great time! Pretty unsightly at breakfast.

There were a few issues but i think you get the picture.

Overall, VERY disappointing to what could be a great hotel. Until the service is rectified, I would NOT recommend this hotel/resort. What a great pity.....","Could be awesome, yet......

Check in super quick.

Rooms very,very large, with semi outdoor monster bathroom. ( private sunbathing ) possible by the half completely open roof,a nice touch..

Food only average, and below par for such a resort . Breakfast buffet poor, Egg Station ,could do with 2 people  frying in peak times ,( no Hoppers) additional toaster would be most welcomed speeding  things up .

Room service very wired  They come to your room with a I Pad to make your choice, so you sit under pressure from room service man trying to decide , this should be scrapped and replaced with written menus or hooked up to Internet ,so guest can browse at thier leisure.

Location fine ,good grounds and little beach

Prices are FAR to expensive ( more than European ) 700 rupees plus tax for a bottle of beer is NOT acceptable, remember more profit is generated by higher volume sells,I would say 500 plus taxes is a fair price ,and would increase sells.

Newer saw pool side cafe/bar open in my 4 day stay ( April 29th _May 2nd) this is also totally unacceptable, I paid to use all facilities ,yet was denied,if facilities are reduced ,due to ' low season' IT should be clearly stated on web site .it amounts to selling under false pretence.

Staff were fantastic at all times .

This hotel really needs to ' knock it's heads together' and address it's Short comings,it IS  fabulous resort, but could really be number 1 with just much more planning and attention to small details ,like TVs not secure, mine fell over, easily addressed and at very little cost. The silly room service I Pads ,I am sure resulting in lost sells ,due to the pressure of staff hovering over you, when you really want to browse and choose .

I will not return until I am certain that hotel is making it to be ' number 1"" 

But my review is my personal thoughts,and I will say again THIS a top resort .

Pasikudah is really calm and peacful, perfect to relax. Unfortunately the hotel is built at a part of the beach, where the beach itsself is full of corals and so you can not actually swimm in the sea.

Overall the sourrounding is quite nice but, there is lots of room for improvement as we had some events, adding some negative flavor to our overall experience:

One one day, the filter system at our pool in the didn't work. We reported it before going to breakfast in the morning. I went back to the room at noon, it still wasn't fixed (whereas roomservice had cleand the room in the meantime) I called a second time and when I came back late afternoon, it still wasn't fixed. So this time I went to report slightely annoyed to the front desk. The manager came with me, checked out the pool and also noticed, it was full of leaves. after about 5 minutes someone came to fix it (which took about 20mins). By now the sun had set and there was honestly no more use for the pool. The manager obviously realized that I was quite annoyed but did not seem very much interested in improving tmy mood. 

=> For the Hotel: Next time, you might offer at least a few drinks or something for the inconveninance. 

On another day we had booked 2 treatments at 2 different times. When I showed up for my treatment, I was asked where my company was. When I answered, that her treatment was booked for another time, the said I was wrong and it would not be possible to do it at another time, as it was all booked. 
(As a sidenote: next to us, there were about 7 other rooms occupied....)

Breakfast and Dinner:
I ram no fan of monotonous hotel easy listening tunes played in lobby, dining room at the bar, at the gym, everwhere. 
Problem at Sun Aqua was: They kept playing one song in an endless loop on and on, and you could even hear it at the beautiful infinity pool. So on the morning of the second day I asked them if they could change it. Guess what happened: They playe ONE other song in endless rotation....

Conclusion: 
A luxury hotel does not only life by a nice bulding and a good location. It is mostly gets it ""Luxury"" reputation from it's quality of service and making the impossible possible at any time. This is by no means what they acheive today.","Lot of potential to improve","2015-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r328421222-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

If you would be kind enough to please reach out to me directly at ibrahim.rasheed@sunaqua.com with further information on your name and period of stay, I would be able to take a closer look at the events that occurred.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

After a rather tiring drive from Colombo we arrived at the Hotel just in time for dinner. The 1st impression of the property was fantastic. The room, although away from the beach was one of the largest, best laid out and comfortable we have had stayed in a long long time. However the looks were deceiving.

There was a used bath robe in the closet. When complained about it, the answer of the most obliging front desk bloke was that the house keeping manager was on vacation hence the short coming. Strike 1

Went to the dinner buffet. An absolute shocker. I have never seen such a poor selection in any hotel let alone a ‘Star Class.. Add to the miserly selection, the food was tasteless. We immediately complained and had the executive chef at our table in no time. He wasn’t much of a talker. Frankly I don’t think we had any meaningful exchange of ideas and if we did, he surely didn’t show it. So we headed to the front office and our friendly superstar knew exactly why we were there. Apparently we were the 3rd or the 4th complainant of the night. His excuse this  time beats them all. “The F&B manager and the GM were on holidays. So the quality of food was poor”. He assured me that the issue would be rectified but I did not have a meal from the hotel again. I had very decent food from a place if I remember right, called Nandams close by and a few other Star Resorts including Uga. Strike 2

The following day my wife needed to get a massage. However she could not pass on the idea ‘sheila’ at the desk. The language gap was way too wide. I am all for providing employment to the locals but with the right communication skills.  2.5

The rooms have a central control unit. Neither the hotel staff nor my family could get the bedside lights working for 2 days. 2.75

The bath tub is open to the elements from the top and was full of dust and a few dead leaves. I guess the house keepers absence was the reason for this. Strike 3
Apart from all that, it was good. Whether we will return next summer diving season…. I don’t think so. This could be one of incident brought about by the local Eid holidays. but I don’t to try my luck again. 

There are enough pretty good star resorts in the area. It’s a shame that such a lovely property is managed rather ordinarily.

One point of interest. The room floor is on split levels with a probably a meter between the two. With no real ‘barriers’ Not too sure how well this arrangement suits a child.","Big Dissapointment","2015-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r305600332-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

To summarize, the prestation is far from what should be provided by this kind of establishment even to low for a two star hotel.

After reading reviews we were really looking forward to our stay.

We arrived around 2.30 pm to a warm welcome and a mini cup of delicious soup.

Our room was good number 101 next to reception. Not ideal when a really terrible band started around 7 pm and boomed through our room.

We had drinks in the lovely bar when we arrived and again before dinner.

Ok onto dinner. 
Where do I start.
After looking at the unappealing food on the buffet we asked if there were other food options. We were told we could buy different food but they could not tell us what food.

We decided to go for the buffet. 
Firstly the soup was tasteless. There was not a lot of salard left and what was was messed around and unappetising.

Onto the main. Three plates of stone cold food. When we said something a lighter was brought and the Bain Marie’s  were put on. Far to late.

Finally we asked for the restaurant manager. He really didn’t know how to handle the situation.

He asked if we had any requests. We asked what was on offer. Finally I ordered steak which was nice. The others could not be bothered after 30 minutes of messing around and trying so much cold food.

We had coffee which the lady asked us to pay for.

All in all the food was horrendous.
Don’t stay here for dinner there are so many lovely options.","Move on","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d506921-r987526733-Galway_Heights_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

During the night all we could here is noises like running taps , needless to say sleep was lacking .

First night we stayed there was absolutely no western food , all curries but had clearly advertised western food in there buffet .

Warmest greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. Please allow me to express my deepest apologies for the distress caused during your stay due to the presence of bats in your room. I can only imagine how unsettling and disruptive this must have been for you. Your understanding and patience in allowing our team to address the matter mean so much to us, and I am truly sorry for the inconvenience you endured.

As a sanctuary that celebrates the harmony between nature and hospitality, our resort is surrounded by the breathtaking beauty of Sri Lanka’s wilderness. While this connection to nature is something we hold dear, I completely understand that encountering wildlife in such close proximity to your accommodations can be uncomfortable. I want to assure you that we are constantly striving to strike a better balance, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us refine our preventive measures.

I also want to personally apologize if my response during this situation did not meet your expectations. It was never my intention to downplay your experience, and I am deeply sorry if my words or actions caused additional distress. Please know that your comfort and satisfaction are at the heart of everything we do, and your comments are a reminder of the care and attentiveness every guest deserves.

Despite this unfortunate incident, I sincerely hope that you were able to find moments of peace and joy in the serene beauty and unique character of Jetwing Vil Uyana. We are incredibly grateful for your trust in choosing us and for sharing your thoughts so openly. It is my heartfelt hope that we will have the privilege of welcoming you back in the future for a stay that is not only restful but truly exceptional in every way.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Spectacular location, large rooms with character, good food, helpful staff - all positive. However, we were unlucky. One evening, returning to our room after dinner, we found bats flying around inside. Staff were helpful in removing them, but they soon found their way back in. Staff came three times to remove them and to try to block up where they were coming in - they were great - but I was still up at 3.30pm getting bats out of the room myself. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked and we could only change rooms the following day. I accept these things happen. What didn't impress me, however, was the attitude of the general manager, who showed virtually no sympathy and empathy. He made light of the matter, almost laughing it off. There was no gesture of goodwill, financial or otherwise. Having slept only two hours that night, we were obviously exhausted for the next few days and it took the edge off our trip.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. However, we would like to address the context of your visit accurately. You were present at our property as a job applicant for approximately two hours and, during this time, engaged in an argument with our HR personnel—a behavior that does not align with the professional standards we uphold.

Our team, including our trainees, operate under clear guidelines and are trained to deliver the highest level of service. It is unfortunate that your experience during the interview process did not meet your expectations, but we maintain that all individuals on our premises—whether guests, applicants, or staff—are expected to communicate respectfully.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We are truly sorry to hear that your recent visit did not meet your expectations, and we sincerely regret that you left feeling disappointed. At Jetwing Vil Uyana, we take immense pride in extending warm, inclusive hospitality to all our guests, regardless of nationality or background.

We understand that your concern relates to a moment during our Christmas celebrations, where Santa Claus distributed gifts as part of the festivities. This tradition is designed to create a joyful atmosphere and bring a touch of festive magic to our younger guests — both local and foreign — who were at the event. We would like to clarify that as Santa had to visit all tables personally to offer gifts to everyone present, he unfortunately took some time to reach yours. We truly regret if there was any misunderstanding or if this moment left you feeling overlooked in any way — that was never our intention.

At Jetwing Vil Uyana, we deeply value all our guests — local and international alike — and ensure that every guest feels appreciated and cared for.

Once again, we are sorry for any disappointment caused and hope to have the privilege of welcoming you back for a stay that reflects the genuine warmth and hospitality we are known for.

It was listed as first class by our travel agent.However it was not. The public rooms were smart and the swimming pool was very good. But the accommodation was dreadful. The first room we occupied a”garden dwelling” was situated  at the far end of the site, next to the generator plant which was so noisy it was impossible to sleep. The bathroom wall had a hole in it where a fitment seemed to have been ripped out. When we complained someone came and filled it in. It did however have a very pleasant sitting out area with sofas, coffee table, fan and outside light.
In order to travel any distance around the site buggies had to be summoned.
After complaining, we were upgraded to a “stilted dwelling “. This was in walking distance of the main building. The telephone did not work. It was one of the worst designed hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The room was enormous. The bed was on a raised platform in the middle of the room. It had a bedside table on only one side (l used an inverted basket on the other). There was inadequate storage space . Outside seating was provided on a small balcony overlooking the lake. It contained a quite large table and two pouffes. These were not comfortable to sit on so we had to move chairs from the room outside. We enjoy sitting outside in the evening but there was no outside light to read by.

Warm greetings from the team at Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you for taking your valuable time to provide us with feedback following your recent stay and for recommending us to followers on other media platforms.

As explained, the initial dwelling shown to you was in fact a water dwelling, albeit situated very close to a potential nesting ground for otters. Hence, during this period, we opted not to disturb the surrounding area, allowing the otters to calmly reside in their new home, which also gave our naturalist the opportunity to study their behaviour over a few weeks since Jetwing Vil Uyana is more than an eco-luxury hotel; it is also a conservation site for animals such as the Grey Slender Loris. I truly apologise once again for the time taken to allocate another water villa of your preference and hope you grant us the opportunity to serve you better on your next visit.

We thank you for your kind sentiments about the friendly and helpful associates, the luxuriously cosy room with a bathtub large enough for two, and the beautiful interiors of the water villa overlooking the lotus-strewn waters. We were thrilled to read your posts on Instagram shared during your stay with us, which positively highlighted the personalised service extended by the team, and certainly look forward to welcoming you in the not-too-distant future.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Overall we had a relaxing stay with the hotel set in an incredible location amongst the wildlife. However does not have the 5 star edge due to a few things: 

- at checkout they try and do a fx arbitrage on you , their guest, because they charge you in rupees then convert your bill into USD at a slightly off-market rate, so on our bill it was around 40usd extra in USD terms using their “exchange rate” vs the actual market rate you would pay if you paid on a card in rupees. Not a huge amount but why try and skim off your customers who are already paying a lot to be there

-non existent butler service: took almost one hour to receive one beer and one Bloody Mary so didn’t order anymore drinks. Sent back the Bloody Mary however they charged us for it at the end 

- food is prepared for the western taste, which is fine. However we specifically asked for spicy curry which they could not provide. Manager was apologetic and the meal was comped. Ordered pasta for the rest of the stay. 

- they should have at least two staff at the spa as the masseuse cannot speak English and I had to interrupt her lunch when I came for my pre booked appointment. There was no refreshment towel, drink or health questionnaire to complete before the massage either - seemed like an amateur operation. Actually a very uninviting spa overall -  real 5 star hotels don’t have spas that amateur","Not the best…","2021-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r823381512-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Morning breakfast was lame and boring...  not a single pastry item ( as opposed to the massive variety of baked goods otherwise expected at a Jetwing Hotel)... and whatever food that did exist lacked soul and falvor.

Saving grace of this entire stay was our buttler Gamini, who did go out of his way to make our stay comfortable. In fact all the staff were really nice and attentive.

Thank you for bringing to our attention the issues you faced during your stay with us. 

Though we did address and discussed some of your concerns while you were staying at the property, please allow us to explain some of those concerns in more details, to ensure fellow TripAdvisor reviewers and potential travelers are well informed of what actually happened, the actions we took to rectify it and what we offered as compensation for the unpleasant experience.

Whilst we sincerely regret the issue you experienced with regards to the door lock initially, you will certainly recall that the matter was addressed on the same day as you reported it, with no additional request subsequently from your end to attend to such matter. 

As you mentioned in your review, and as per the conversation you had with the hotel team and General Manager, it is correct that we had an issue with one of the security officers we contracted with. We did share with you the steps taken, namely that the person was identified and terminated immediately, and that we are in the process of employing our own Jetwing security personnel for the property. 

We were certainly very concerned by the incident and the team and the hotel General Manager were there to reassure you and explain the measures taken. We trust that you appreciated our gesture of goodwill, for the inconvenience you faced, of refunding your entire stay for the 2 nights you stayed at our property.

Let us thank you for bringing to our attention some other issues you faced as well and rest assured that we are attending to each of them, especially the ones related to maintenance.

Again thank you for your constructive feedback and wishing you all the best for your future travels!

However, all those issues were eclipsed by a near tragedy our second, and last, night on the property.

One of the problems with our villa was a temperamental door lock that would pop open when we thought it was set. We told staff about it the first night, and again the next day—and they must have wrestled with it every time they left the room. But they did nothing to fix it. I was able to figure out how to manipulate the lock each time we went out so that we could leave the room without worrying, but there was no way to make it lock securely from the inside, except to use the chain higher up on the door. Thank god we did that night!

Sometime around 2AM a loud click woke me up; it sounded like it came from inside the room. But I didn’t hear anything else, and guessed it was an animal outside, or maybe the bat that lived in the villa (!)

The next morning, when we left for breakfast, we found a trail of dirty barefoot-prints crossing the entry to the villa and heading up the stairs to our door (see pic). With a shock we realized that the sound I’d heard was someone trying to break in and rob us, or worse. They must have been spooked when the bad lock clicked open, or were foiled by the chain.

Clearly this was an inside job, involving a staff person who knew about the funky lock. 

The manager on duty was concerned, but all he could muster was “sorry for the inconvenience.” An understatement in my opinion, given how close we’d come to a very bad outcome.

Two days later I got a call from the GM, who had been in Colombo at the time. He was very apologetic, and seemed genuinely horrified about what had happened. That made me feel better. He also offered to refund our stay, displaying some professionalism. But I still feel that I need to warn others about the lax security at the property, and the fact that at least one of the staff is a criminal. 

In the week since that experience, I still find myself waking up at night, spooked by any sound. Jetwing destroyed my peace of mind.

Other, but in retrospect less serious, problems with the villa included a lack of privacy whenever the curtains were not drawn over the floor-to-ceiling deck windows (112 faces an interior road and every time someone walks by, they have an unobstructed view into the room—very bad design!); the run-down appearance of the walls and floors in some spots; dysfunctional wi-fi when we first checked into the room (fixed a few hours later); rough, old towels (they should be higher quality at a hotel in this price range) and an adequate, but not exceptional, breakfast. Both nights we ate outside the hotel, so we can’t comment on the restaurant for lunch of dinner.

This was our first experience with Jetwing hotels (a chain of high-priced properties in SL). It’ll definitely be our last.","Attempted break-in while we slept!","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r745881911-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

- Booked the cheapest category room, when shown to room 145, could not believe it's only 5m away from the resort sewage treatment plant. If sitting outdoor which we were planning to then had to look at the ugly sight as well as the constant noise and unpleasant smell. When requested to move we were told the hotel was full so we asked if we could have the money back and got on to the travel agent to inform and also requested for alternative resort. It was only then that the manager said that he managed to shuffle guests around and upgraded us to a higher category room. We were grateful for his help but why waited until we were about to check out, not to mention how the hotel thought that they could get away with putting guests in that room when it’s not cheap!

- The villa was split over 2 levels with a private pool. While the villa was really nice and big, the views from the balconies  over the bush were OK not that special.

- Saw 3 loris within 30 minutes, were given a red light to wear on the forehead in order to spot and see loris. My strap was so smelly from sweat. The straps should have been washed after each use for hygiene reasons.

- Had a cooking class with the executive chef and it was good fun. Could get most ingredients back in Australia so certainly would give it a go. Thoroughly enjoyed the curry dishes cooked by us for lunch.

- Had half board dinner of 6 courses & it was excellent food but too much for us. The best meals in Sri Lanka for almost 2 weeks. Tasty and delicious food without being fussy. The executive chef and all his staff remembered my dietary requirements and catered accordingly without prompting. He even made a VietNamese salad for me after discussing Vietnamese cuisine during the cooking class. I felt very special. The chef went around and talked to a lot of guests every night. Really good PR!

- Service was good in general but not excellent and lacking the warmth & personal touches compared to some smaller hotels that we had been on the trip, however, we were very impressed with the GM who was always in the lobby to greet guests & made an effort to walk around talking to guests at meal time.

- When checked out it took reception staff 4 attempts to get the bill right. This was not acceptable!

It would have been a really nice resort & pleasant stay without the aforementioned issues.","It’s rather disappointing!","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r672423192-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to post a review and bringing to our attention the many difficulties you faced during your stay. We regret not being able to meet your expectations in terms of the design of our hotel which is otherwise highlighted as unique by our other guests. The steps to the toilet have sensor lights that switch on when our guests need to use the bathroom which avoids any accidents or disturbances. We prefer placing the tea-coffee making facilities in the bedroom as opposed to the bathroom where the basin is. 

Our main restaurant opens from 6.30am to 10.00am for breakfast, 12.00pm to 3.00pm for lunch and 7.30pm to 10.30pm for dinner. However Sulang cafe which is located downstairs around the pool and the library, serves snacks and beverages any time of the day. We also have 24/7 room service and have placed room service menus in every room.  

We think you'd be interested to know our commitment to sustainability is broad and is not limited to room amenities. Do follow the this link for more information http://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingviluyana/sustainability/

Once in the room, you need to go up about six steps to the bed area and then to get to the toilet/shower area - down two very steep steps.  Yet the land doesn’t change like that.  I felt all the time that it was an accident waiting to happen especially in the middle of the night when you want to use the toilet.  The tea/coffee making facilities are as far from the basin (for emptying water or washing cups) as they could be and with two small bottles of water supplied, you are likely to need to ring to ask for more pretty quickly.  Their approach to sustainability is excellent but in this case, that means tiny glass bottles of product in the shower and wasting lots of water while you try and unscrew the lid and actually get the product  out.   It also means huge towels that must require extra water, power and product to wash and dry.  The light switches just don’t make sense and there are no extra power points for the technology charging you need these days.  The fan and air conditioning are placed over the bed and over the mosquito net so on a hot night, you can have the noisy air conditioner on but no mosquito net.  The restaurant ( also up a very steep staircase) is disappointing - it doesn’t open until 7:30 pm which is very late after a long, hot,  day exploring, the food is expensive and the staff were not welcoming.  It gets very busy as soon as it opens so the wait for service is lengthy.  Power and wifi are intermittent which is frustrating but that may not be the hotel’s fault as the generator cuts in quickly.  On the plus side - the shower is great with good hot water supply, the breakfast is excellent and the bed was comfortable.  I would not be a repeat customer here.","Major design issues impact comfort","2019-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r660142496-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to post a review on TripAdvisor following your stay. We are greatly disturbed after reading your review as such comments are seldom heard and your review has our fullest attention. I really appreciate if you could write to me in detail regarding every aspect we failed you, especially in terms of service. Please do email me direct at kingsley@jetwiinghotels.com. 

However we would like to point out that our property is not merely hyped up as eco-friendly. It is built on a man-made wetland reserve. The setting you just commented as beautiful was completely created by us as these lands were barren land before. The lake too was man-made. Our inspiration was the Barnes Wetland Center in London. Today, these lands have become a sanctuary to over 125 bird species and many elusive creatures such as the Grey slender loris, the fishing cat and Eurasian otter. Crocodiles too have found residence in our lakes. We have the only loris conservation site in Asia and our property was designed by Sri Lanka's leading environmental designer - Sunela Jayawardane. 

For now, please accept our most humble apology for any inconvenience caused and I look forward to hearing from you.

My dad has recovered from a paralysis so has issues with steps. Hense i specially asked this lady about stairs in the rooms and hotel where she told me that only the restaurant had stairs and they would arrange meals downstairs for me. 

Then I reached the hotel and had the shock of my life. The forrest villa i booked had two levels where the bed room is only accessible with stairs. So my dad had to keep going up and down to have a bath or go to the pool. Also for each meal he had to do the same. It was a disaster and was a very bad start to the vacation. They offered to change the villa with supposed to be a lower amount of steps which also was equally bad. Hense throughout the holiday my dad was continuously struggling with regards to access.

But I should say the staff at the hotel did there best to handle the mess created by the head office. This review is not because of lack of service or quality at the resort but simply because of misguiding and cheating guests by the head office reservation staff.

We had stayed the previous night in the Water Garden, which was a beautiful two story villa with living room, pool etc.  We arrived at 7pm, in the rain, and waited 20 mins for a shuttle from a sandy car park that is the entrance.  Then after the usual long check in, we were asked to do a 'tour' of the facilities, including a wine cellar where added cost 'private dining' is offered, with a low entry way where I banged my head pretty hard (no padding or warning signs - and I am only 5'3""). 

Finally we were driven in a golf cart through the sand to the villa.  The bottom floor turned out to be one huge Stalinist concrete bathroom, with no doors on the toilet or shower, a huge hole in the roof, a mosquito breeding pond and a sand pit.  No living room, and one concrete couch.  There was only one bedroom (the only place with a door and ac), and they charged us for mattresses on the floor for the kids.  The concrete steps were slippery. The mosquito net was hung so that it did not protect the sleepers.  Terrible and not appropriate for a family.  I was in tears at that point from the bang on the head and the waste of $600.

We had paid for the half board dinner, which was very average.  I didn't eat most of it.  Dessert was the best part.  They also charged a lot for bottled water, which is annoying.  I noticed during the breakfast, free drinking water was served.  

During dinner the manager did come over and offer us a separate room for the kids.  At that point I was ready to just get back to the camp site and leave as soon as possible in the morning, but we checked out the room anyway and took them up on the offer.  The rooms were average but seem a much better deal than the villas, although the little pool was nice (but no more than 4 foot deep).

Overall I would not recommend this place.  Stay at the Water Garden.  Its the same price and 100% better.  There is just as much cool wildlife at the Water Garden and the facilities and food are much better.","Beware - villas have no toilet doors and concrete couches","2018-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r626631279-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to write a review following your stay with us. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the inconveniences caused during the stay. 

As you may recall, it was a night of bad weather with heavy rains and winds, because of which our team of associates may have been pre-occupied with safeguarding the property and ensuring the safety of our guests. And so, we might not have been able to give you the personal attention we are usually praised upon and the Loris trail was also canceled with your safety in mind. 

Since this was an exceptional situation, we hope you will give us another opportunity to show the true hospitality offered at Jetwing Vil Uyana. We would be more than happy to welcome you and your loved ones for a memorable stay sometime in the future.

When we arrived via car, it was pouring, and the staff at the pavilion just stood inside with an umbrella but did not even bother to help when we got out of the car. We waited for 10 minutes before our buggy arrived (during which we became easy targets for mosquitoes), the same staff did once again stayed put inside the pavilion when we had to move our luggages into the buggy. 

Food was not bad but service was slow. Our mosquito net wasn't put in place after housekeeping (it was when we first arrived). The slender loris tour was cancelled because it was raining, and on asking what happens if it stops raining later, they said the path will be muddy so it will still be cancelled.

If you are a lover of antiques this is the place to be!

But......

If you are a lover of antiques, magic, ambience, service and a holiday to remember for ever, this is not a place to stay.  Well, you may have better luck to tick these boxes but I did not!

1) I found the room that had not been cleaned to a standard of a 5* property let alone a 3*. Cobwebs, dust, insects (dead), ants in the rooms.  These faux pas noted within 5 minutes of walking into the rooms.
2) The bathroom was stocked with half used set of shampoo/bath wash. This was evidently leftover from the previous occupants of the room.
3) No turn down service. Guests were expected to arrange and open mosquito nets and remove the numerous pillows adorning the bed, because housekeeping is not available after a certain hour. We arrived at 8pm because we drove from Colombo airport to Wadduwa having  landed in the morning but decided to include a day trip to Negombo. Our late arrival was communicated in certain choice responses as an inconvenience. It was further mentioned that our annoyance at these remarks that we dont not have a sense of humour.
4) My wife has food intolerances that were communicated by the booking agent and we personally followed up and re-communicated the same to the kitchen staff at the Summer Breeze restaurant during our first night dinner, but during breakfast the next morning these instructions, whilst noted the night before, were not adhered to during breakfast. When this was pointed out this little mistake was denied even though it was physically evident on the plate of food.
5) These issues were communicated to the management and person(s) who know who they are but they were again in total denial until I decided enough is enough and I would rather check out and risk finding a lesser quality property for the rest of my stay. At this point it was agreed and an apology was offered this is not acceptable and that they had let us down regarding the cleanliness, dietary requirements and house keeping issues. But since it had to take my decision to cut short my stay to get the staff to realise they had let us down in the less than expected service, it was too late for my mind to be changed.

I am sure if you decide to stay at this property after reading my experience, I think you will find that your stay has been magic, as it should be because my experience has made the management realise they need to up their game 100 fold. I am sure you can make your own mind up.","Shame!","2022-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r828442113-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

We have responded to your emails many times.

The cancellation policy isn’t incorrect.  
You made your booking in 2019 on a special offer for three nights, 18 months ago.
Only a partial amount of the deposit was paid.  Our normal deposit for this type of booking is 50%.
You changed the booking date of arrival several times and the number of rooms to which we agreed. 
18 months after making the booking you requested a refund.
We don’t offer deposit refunds on special offers, however we offered to extend your booking for up to 3 years.  This would have included your recent booking for 4 suites to stay in April 2022 which you cancelled again.  We consider we have been more than reasonable and extremely flexible, we are sorry you don’t agree.

our first impression was an amazing hotel. it looked beautiful a lot of details and very stylish.
it was only a picture...
it's amazing how they ruin our first impression. on the same night, we came.
please keep in mind it is five stars hotel, which costs as 5 stars hotel, and:
(1) bathroom. there is no ventilation in the bathroom at all. only a ceiling fan, that kind using in Asia. So it was difficult to breathe, and it was a big question of sanitation as well;
(2) there was only one robe in the room for two people. and both slippers had a size of 38  only, while I have 43. very uncomfortable.
(3) restaurant. I was surprised they asking us to preorder the food before coming to the restaurant. but after we came to have dinner it was clear they are not cooking, they just bring the food from another place. food delivery service. they served it cold to us and the food quality was the second rate. even street food in Sri Lanka has a better taste. We ordered two glasses of different red wines. they brought it chilled... hmmm.. ok. I asked to bring another with a regular temperature. after the first drink, I reduced to drink more because it was very cheap in both glasses. To be a more clear glass of wine in this place costs around USD 10 and every meal costs us approximately USD 20. it was our 5th day on Sri Lanka and we had very delicious dinners in two other 5-star hotels for USD 30-50 for two persons including drinks.
(4) reception. it works up-to 10 pm as it is written onto the notice in our room. Does it suites to a 5-star hotel? I don't think so. By the way, after our check-in at 7.30 pm, I'd never seen anyone at the reception desk.
(5) bed. we were badly surprised there wasn't any blanked not only on the bad but in the room at all. while nobody at reception to ask to bring us one. the building was locked. I explored how to get out and found one person from the staff. He told me that they serve with a blanket only by request! but he promised me to find one. and it looks he exactly found it, he brought unfilled blanked which had the form of the crumpled ball.
(6) wifi. yes, it exists. but even situated in the main building you have only one stick.
(7) location. it locates in a very strange place it was hardly found by local drivers. it is rail-road right 3 meters opposite the hotel's gate. So, you can hear how rail-road sounds from time to time inside the hotel.

finally, we were very upset and decided to left this place the next morning in spite of we had a non-refundable rate.","Spoiled day of vacation at Reef Villa & Spa, Sri Lanka","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r738120821-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

We planned Reef Villa as our last stop in Sri Lanka with a very big expectation to have the best part at the last!
We are a family with two small kids and we arrived at place in the evening and right after checking in our room, we had our dinner in the restaurant. The food was so tasty as expected and we really hoped we were at the right place.
After dinner we went to our room and started to settle till i saw our baby's foot sole. It was shocking as the bottom of the feet of our kids who were exploring around the room were completely covered with dust! I removed my shoes and had few steps on the floor and could not believe how dirty and dusty my feet became! I checked the floor with my fingers and faced bunch of dust on my fingers! Unbelievable! Like the room was not cleaned for days!
I have called the front desk numbers in hotel with no response! Finally i could reach the security office on the phone and we were informed that nobody is available in the hotel! The house keeping is available only in the morning they said! Basically there was nobody left except the security guard in the hotel by about 10:30PM! We were desperate to stay in the dusty room for the night and felt completely uncomfortable!
In the morning the hotel manager came to our room and i showed him the situation and he apologized and he admitted that is not acceptable to have such condition and he has arranged the house keeping to deep clean our room. Of course from that moment onward we have already spent first half of our stay with big disappointment and regret for experiencing that bad night with much much higher price than any other much better hotel. 
The hotel rooms are uniquely large and really well decorated which feels like a luxurious palace room. However, the moment you feel the place is dirty makes everything else meaningless!
Anyway, we did not have anything to do but trying to enjoy our last day without bothering much and without any further expectation..
I should be fair to say the chef in the place is really amazing and every dish we had was really delicious. The restaurant staff and life guard Nihal was really kind and helpful, he helped a lot to take care of our baby while enjoying in the pool. We had a barbecue by the beach which was so nice.
Before leaving the hotel, we were given a guest book to sign by the restaurant staff and whatever happens, i wrote nice comments because they were really nice and kind. I would not find any point to leave a bad impression or comment for that book.
After leaving country though, i have shared my bad experience with the hotel owner and told how disappointed we were and i sent them the picture i took showing how dirty our foot became in the first night in dusty room. 
I have received a very rude and arrogant answer basically blaming me for being disrespectful. He mentioned maybe my foot was dirty before i arrived in hotel! He claimed that sending the picture of sole foot is upsetting the two muslim house keeping staff which i did not see any point for mentioning the religion of their house keeping staff for proof of anything! He extracted my comments from the guest book and said i was contradicting with my comments and he also claimed that since i haven't raise any complaint to him directly at hotel, it didn't seem i had that bad time.
So, basically i was blamed to be lying!
If you see the pictures of the place on their website, it is very green and beautiful lawn but, what you see in reality is a dried grass and unmaintained lawn! When i raised this, the owner said they are in need of rain and they cannot water the grass because they are an eco-friendly hotel and they don't want to waste the water. For an extremely overpriced hotel, that excuse doesn't sound any reasonable and realistic.
If you see the responses given to any negative comment on TripAdvisor from this hotel owner, you can understand how rude and arrogant he is. Basically he does not take any negative comment worth to be considered rather blames the reviewer.
There are much cheaper, very beautiful, clean and luxurious hotels (5 star hotel or villa) in Sri Lanka..

Actually, I have no idea how to respond to your review as you had not one single complaint while you stayed with us?

From your review it seems the costs were the main issue.

It would be worth reminding you that you booked several months before you stayed with us and you particularly wanted to stay over the New Year knowing the costs including the holiday supplement.  As you were fully aware, all our prices and menus are shown on our website.

We are a luxury property with first class service, and yes we make no excuse for being at the upper end in quality and in cost terms; we offer a fabulous private beach property, totally secluded with a fantastic seafood restaurant.

We are the only Conde Nast Johansens recommended property in Sri Lanka, for the past three years running.

It is particularly interesting to see you have made nearly one hundred “contributions” to Trip Advisor, which in itself speaks volumes.","450","38195383","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/b7/outdoor-shower.jpg","336","410","38195386","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/ba/bathroom.jpg","550","410","38195388","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/bc/our-suite-from-the-outside.jpg","550","410","38195392","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/c0/view-from-our-terrace.jpg","550","410","38195396","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/c4/room.jpg","550","410","38195400","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/c8/room.jpg","550","450","38195404","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/cc/restaurant.jpg","336","410","38195407","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/cf/restaurant-and-pool.jpg","550","410","38195411","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/d3/new-year-s-dinner-set.jpg","550","410","38195416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/46/d0/d8/resort-seen-from-the.jpg","550",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"78 Samanthara Rd, Wadduwa 12560 Sri Lanka","Wadduwa","Sri Lanka","12560",,"78 Samanthara Rd","","1233956","6.659596","Wadduwa, Western Province","79.92986","Reef Villa & Spa","634","4.9","6","2","11","32","583","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499081-d1233956-Reviews-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html","https://www.facebook.com/ReefVillaandSpa/?ref=ss","2012-01-11","OTHER","2","Ensure you do not book the suite which is right in front of the restaurant","Value","2","Rooms","4","Location","2","Cleanliness","4","Service","2","Sleep Quality","4","Since all the reviews were very good and there were not a lot of options left over for the New year's break we decided to book Reef Villas.

The resort is really nicely set up in lovely spacious gardens with fishponds everywhere (as well as mosquitos), dogs, ducks and iguanas are roaming around freely. All suites and common areas are decorated with a lot of attention to detail, you can see the owners put in a lot of effort. I prefer a more minimalist approach but that is very personal. It really was very beautifully decorated.
Our suite, Ketikaya, was spacious with a large four-poster bed and a separate bed including mosquito net for our son. The rooms are a bit dark though as the windows are kept fairly small and your terrace has a low roof therefore there is not a lot of light coming in which I do prefer when staying in a beach resort. We overlooked the pool directly plus the sea and was great so we were close to our suite and the pool as we are travelling with a child. However the suite next door was overlooking the restaurant......

The owners are very friendly and helpful as is the staff; they were all extremely friendly and outgoing. They kept bringing pieces of bread so our son could feed the fish, they were always smiling and greeting you.

There are a few cons though: One of the main ones is that the hotel is extremely high priced, I would say terrible overpriced actually for what you get.
1. Bathroom amenities - you receive mini bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, 2 of each and 2 pieces of soap. And they do not replace the bottles on a daily basis (we were with 3 so we did use quiet a lot). When paying 500++USD as well as 60++USD for our child you do expect good shower gel and the rest in large bottles which you can use freely instead of a bar of soap. Second, there were 3 towels on a daily basis, no evening replacement as hotels in this price segment do. Toilet paper did not get replaced as well and we had to phone twice to get a top up
2. Restaurant - you had to stick to the curries as they were really good, I loved the veggie curry, the chicken coconut and lime parcels, the cumin scented chicken. They came with dhal, chutney and pickles. All really good and I did look forward to dinner each night. They make you indeed pre-order as they mention they can start marinating etc. Normally we ordered around 6pm so that was alright.
But if you order western food......the quality was horrible. I had a chicken wrap for lunch and the filling was dripping with mayonnaise, I was actually nauseous the rest of the day after consuming it. And they charge around 19USD for a chicken wrap which I find extremely expensive. Since they have the only decent restaurant in the vicinity, there is no other choice than to pay but being a Sri Lank and paying more than I ever did for a wrap in Singapore (which is one of the most expensive countries in Asia, does not feel right. 
Breakfast was very basic - some fruits and fruit juice, eggs in different styles but every day the order with the side dishes went wrong. everyday |I had to ask again for strawberry jam as the prefer to give pineapple and marmalade. Jam was of super mart quality. Sri Lankan omelet was actually quiet nice but I can't eat eggs every day so I was stuck to toast or cornflakes. Again for these prices I do expect at least a basket with pastries, decent jams and more choices of breakfast. And for the 500++ USD cappuccino's were not included in the breakfast but charged separately for 4.5USD
3. New Year's dinner - as per usual, we had to pay for new year's dinner as it is mandatory which is okay. However we had to pay for our 5year old as well and he is asleep by 8pm, dinner only starting at 8.30pm.....which meant we paid 87++ USD for literally nothing. This began to feel like we are seen as some kind of money tree, just ensuring you get as much dollars as possible from your guests.
Dinner was set up in the garden with fairy lights and coconut torches, really extremely nice. There were fireworks afterwards. They could have left the Kandyan dancers out as they were hopping around for about 1 hour, doing some bad singing or having some music coming from the loudspeakers which hurt the ears. The food again was of horrible quality: I ordered my steak medium and it was served rare. Even when returning it to the kitchen it did not become medium and I did not eat half of it. My husbands steak had the same problem but since he is less picky, he ate it. The manager came to our table afterwards and offered us another dish but after half finishing it, I did not feel like getting another main course (I would have suggested they offered us a free main course the next day) Also since they had our pre-order wrong twice (why have us choose if you serve something completely different). we started with a smoked salmon parcel (welcome back to the eighties) which I did not eat since the sauce was the famous mayo again. Then I had pasta however was served a quail package. Needless to say I returned the package and received my dish after my husband finished his quail. What's the point of eating together, right....
The sorbet in between was actually nice. As dessert I had the Sri Lankan dessert which they also served to my husband who order the other dish.....Interesting cake and quiet nice but the vanilla ice-cream did not taste like vanilla at all. Dinner was finished with coffee (filter) or tea and some chocolates. For the 175USD++ we did not even receive a glass of champagne at 12 o'clock......
4. Service - the staff was extremely helpful but slow as snails - everything you asked for took easily 20-30 minutes, extra towels and shampoo around bed time, cappuccino in the morning, breakfast. It was as if they have no idea what they are doing and what service is all about. Asking when they should come by to do the turn down service (6.30pm) and then me having to call them two days in a row at 7.45pm if they could do it now since our son is going to sleep. Asking for extra towels, phoning twice and by the time they arrived 1 hour later everyone was showered. Asking when they should pick up the suitcases, we said in 5 minutes and then 20 minutes later it has still not happened
5. Check out - the most inexperienced staff member managed our check out and made a mistake in the invoice so we had to pay the commision seperately but the cc machine was not working anymore. If there is one thing you should have your most experienced person manage, it is check out. After going through this whole process, our bags were still in our room and they needed to find someone to go and pick them up
6. seating arrangements at the restaurant are managed on an interesting basis: last one to arrive at the resort gets the table in the middle of the restaurant. The other 6 are all aligned along the wooden railing and enjoy a view of the gardens/sea/pool, except for that one table. And because the roof is overhanging and low, you are really tucked away in the 'dark'. We were in luck since another family was leaving the next day and we got their table for the rest of our stay. So even when people are not there for breakfast or dinner, the table cannot be used.

To end on a positive note: the garden is right on the beach together with the infinity pool, they look impeccable with beautiful hammocks. However the ocean is not really swimmable because of the strong currents, also not when you are in season, there are strong waves and there is a very strong surf. People do indeed go into the sea and jump into the waves but it is only possible for good swimmers. Beach is endless and golden but there is a lot of dirt on the beach (not in front of the hotel as the hotel cleans it every day)  but when you go for a stroll you come across all kinds of stuff as it is all public. There are also cows, dogs and some pigs roaming around which I found very cute.
Wadduwa itself has nothing besides some cheap hotels and a super mart. No need to stay there for the village, restaurants or the facilities. 
The hotel offers excursions however they are again very expensive and wadduwa is quiet far from all the touristic places and traffic is very slow in Sri Lanka as they only have 1 highway. Using the highway it will take you you 1.5 to 2 hours to get to Galle.

Good thing, the hotel had wifi in the room and restaurant!

First of all, since Lighthouse and Kurulubedda have the same telephone operating system, we got wrong information over the phone but this mistake is partially from our end too, as we should have made things more clear but we didn't expect both properties to have the same system. So, we reserved a room via phone call and went there to find out the booking was not made there, instead made at Lighthouse. Thankfully, there were rooms available - the regular room and room with the plunge pool. We went with the plunge pool, since it was less than half the price of what was said to us on the call. My first impression of the room was that it was nice but the toilet seat was filthy - it was completely discoloured and should have been changed ages ago. The A/C took forever to cool and the manager told us to give the A/C 45 minutes for it to do its job, which seemed like a complete joke at the time. But even 45 minutes later, it was not cool but some mode changes on the remote seemed to do the trick. The main pool was one of the filthiest pools I've ever come across, with so many flowers and leaves floating and tiles that were not maintained whatsoever. Next, the light in the plunge pool and in the plunge pool area didn't function properly and it was way too dark for us to enjoy it for the intended time period. When it was time to check out, we needed to switch on the flashlight to look for something that had fallen and guess what, the area behind the TV cabinet was extremely dusty. The TV was also placed at an extremely strange angle as the mosquito net was blocking our view and had to be moved awkwardly to watch TV. The rooms are not soundproof, which has its pros and cons - while hearing the birds chirp is so refreshing, hearing people from the other villa and vehicles on the road wasn't the ideal setup. But one of the highlights was being able to eat on your own balcony, without having to dress up and go into the usual buffet. The food and customer service too was excellent. The wrong information about the room rates and meal plan (over the phone they said it was buffet but they do not offer buffet here), would have been completely fine, had they put in more effort into maintaining the cleanliness, which was unacceptable from a Jetwing property.","Very Disappointing","2021-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r786693855-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Greetings from all of us at Jetwing Kurulubedda. We are extremely disappointed in reading your review and knowing that you had to face an inconvenience with regards to your reservation. 
 
Jetwing Kurulubedda is a property that consists of only 06 villas and we have had a favourable response from many travellers  in the past months. As such, at times, the villas get fully booked. This was one of those situations and due to a system error your reservation resulted in an over-booking, which we admit, should have been communicated to you well in advance. Please rest assured that the reservations team has been notified and the necessary actions have been taken to prevent any re-occurrences. 
 
I make this an opportunity to extend my humble apologies on behalf of the Jetwing team for the inconveniences caused. We thank you for being so kind in the midst of this confusion and assisting us to make things right with a transfer to our sister hotel Jetwing Lighthouse. 
 
We hope that this experience will not deter you from visiting us again in future as we would love for you to experience the serenity and hospitality of Jetwing Kurulubedda someday in the future. 
 

Ayubowan! (May you live long)

We choosed Jetwing Kurulubedda as it was small villa type hotel and I saw that this is located in a calm and serene atmosphere, but unexpectedly they asked us to move to there other hotel.

Where to begin? The rooms weren’t ready when we arrived, which was fine because they suggested we have lunch while we wait. Big mistake. Lunch took 2.5 hours to be provided and even worse the rooms were still not ready. Start to finish 4 hours until our rooms were ready because there was insufficient staff to clean up. The rooms were incomplete, one of them didn’t have a tea kettle, another seemed like it had not been cleaned or opened up in a while. Smelled musty and uncomfortable. 

The next day they had organized a complimentary boat ride along the river to breakfast at the Lighthouse Hotel. This was by far the worst experience of the lot. The ride takes you past a massive rubbish dump and the river itself have garbage floating in it. I was embarrassed as a Sri Lankan given I had foreign family friends with me who were visiting for the first time. Worst part was that the boat moored at what seemed to be someone’s tiny shack which was untidy and all over the place. There were meant to be tuk tuks waiting to take us to the Lighthouse Hotel but they were late so we walked.

We both enjoy travelling and like to do things the local way on public transport and in homestays. However as it was our honeymoon we booked a couple of nights of luxury in the middle. We do not usually stay in luxury accommodation so hardly have high expectations but for the price we paid (over £200) in comparision to what we got for our £10 in various homestays, we expected a LOT more. You have to check in at the Lighthouse, which we only found out from reading other reviews. The staff here were friendly enough but refused to serve us lunch while we were waiting to get into our room because we did not look the part and they did not believe we were staying here. When our room was ready, the staff did not know where our bags had been stored when we went to get them. The property advertises a short relaxing boat ride to the hotel - in reality we had to bundle our own bags into a tuk tuk (we are used to carrying our own bags around, but this is a service I expected for such a price), which took us to someones back yard, where we then bundled our own bags into a boat. The boat ride itself was nice enough but we'd kind of had enough of waiting around being judged by then. Also turns out you only get this once - if you want to use the lighthouse facilities again you have to pay for a tuk tuk - we walked, it's not far.

The property is beautiful and set among the forest - we are both nature lovers and enjoyed the wildlife. However, it needed a lot of refurb - again, something that doesn't bother us in places we usually stay, but not what we expect for £200 a night. I have stayed in nicer places in SL since for a fraction of the cost. It was a quirky room with comfortable facilities and private balconies, although they overlook the properties and their plunge pools next door.

Food was nice, although service could be a lot better. We asked for local Sri Lankan food for dinner and explained that we did not want it too spicy - were served the spiciest foods we have ever had, even the waiter said that they would never normally serve it to anyone but a hardened local so staff clearly hadn't listened to us properly. We couldn't eat much of our meal so were disappointed - and hungry, despite having paid extortionate prices! The next day we ate at the lighthouse and recommend their buffet. 

The main thing that bothered us is that service very much depended on status - we are not five star people and it's obvious so we were more or less left to fend for ourselves while the staff ran around after their wealthy clients. Lots of little things like staff taking our cups away and not replacing them so that we had to run around looking for somebody to ask for a cup to even make a cup of tea. On the last day we were offered  a lift to the bus station, which was then retracted because somebody of higher status wanted the car Instead we were offered a tuk tuk at grossly inflated price - we declined and got our own from the end of the road for a third of the cost.

Not quite sure if they are trying to be an eco lodge (if so, there are MUCH cheaper with a better experience) or a luxury personalised service (for which they are simply not up to scratch). Having read about Jetwing since our stay, it seems very much like they are used by an exclusive clientele who only travel Jetwing around Sri Lanka, so the staff know who to impress - and who don't matter.

For a couple just wanting a couple of days of relaxing luxury to break up a busy trip we did not get what we hoped for - we booked another night of luxury at the end of our trip in Kandy at the Earl's Regency and received a totally different experience from start to finish for half the price.","Identity crisis!","2017-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r516941734-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The villa itself differs a lot from what is shown in pics.  The minimalistic approach is extreme.  No towels, bed side carpets, mirror in the room, etc.  The bathroom light was continuously flickering n staff did nothing. The worst was when we realised that the aircon is not working in the night.  In the middle of the night we had to shift rooms and instead of giving us a better room we got a tiny version of original.  Further the shower cud not be completely shut n waters was dripping throughout the night.  There was no soap or shower gel in the room either.

What is good about the place is their food n butler service.  Dinesh went out of his way to please us n food was very tasty n just as we expected.  But the hotel actually wanted to charge us Bcuz by mistake I broke one of the toiletries bottles while taking a bath !!!! Wow ....

Thank you for taking the time share with us your recent experience at Jetwing Kurulubedda, Galle. We are sorry to know you had not received the expected experience from us and we most humbly extend our humble apologies for the inconveniences caused.

Your comment about the unorganized check-in has my full attention. You should not have been hassled to go to Jetwing Lighthouse to do the needful. Please excuse this careless mistake by the associates who are also very new to the property and are in the process of getting things organized and streamlined. However, it is relieving to know that my Front Office Executive had met you and had done his best to put things right. His suggestion for you to transfer from Jetwing Kurulubedda to Jetwing Lighthouse was purely a gesture to try and fix things as you had already been upset with the set-up at Jetwing Kurulubedda.

Finally, since you had not wanted to continue your reservation at Jetwing Kurulubedda, nor transfer to Jetwing Lighthouse, you had been suggested to visit Amaloh by Jetwing in Matara, to which you had agreed. I was informed by Mr. Vivian that you had liked the property and had been quite comfortable with the good services of hospitality that had been extended at Amaloh by Jetwing.

All in all, I once again most humbly apologize for all our shortcomings and sincerely hope this would not deter you from staying with us again the next time you visit Galle.

I was informed that the process can be completed at the New Wing of the Light House and subsequently I was informed by the front desk that it was in the old wing. By this time I was exhausted and really disappointed with the entire experience. Given same I requested to see the Manager on arrival at the old wing and a front office executive named ‘Vivian’ came to my rescue. He definitely knew exactly what needs to be done to manage the situation. He took time to listen to my frustration and offered to provide a room at light house. I politely declined same as we have been to light house many times in the past. Based on our request Vivian got our reservation transferred to Amaloh, Matara.

2) Apalling behaviour - 1st floor reception asked us to find our way to the Kurulubedda by asking anyone downstairs.

3) Ghastly 1st impression - On arrival you park at a neighbour's house and the 20 or so construction workers giving you a virtual dressdown.

4) Dangerous walkway - Due to the work in progress,makeshift plank pathways are arranged which coupled with the rain provide slip hazards and a couple of near miss accidents.

5) Near miss Experience - My spouse tripped on one of the many wires running around (after having dodged so many of them) and nearly fell over as i caught her.Would have sued Jetwing instead of this review.

6) 3rd Class accomodation - Bad condition of Accomodation as most of the doors and wooden panels were ridden with insects and lizards and the washroom areas wère lacking in regular maintenance/upkeep.

7) Service redundant - We were served breakfast at the villa and the leftover plates stayed there till we checked out 2 days later.

Overall a terrible experience that caused me more grief and misery than any other  service related experience.I didnt ask for a refund as it was my fault for not reading the reviews and booking based on my past experiences with Jetwing which were very memorable for all the right reasons.

Your only saving Grace is the wonderful staff and service level of Cardamon Cafe and the commitment of your restaurant manager.

Thank you for taking the time to post a review on Trip Advisor, and we deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you for the planned birthday surprise. 

We take our commitment to guest satisfaction very seriously thus we were disturbed to read about your experiences. Our sincere apologies for the unexpected experience caused due to the construction work in site and not informing about the situation during the reservation.  I’m sorry to say you have got the wrong information on the deluxe room which was provided as an alternative solution at Jetwing Lighthouse, this room is priced higher than Jetwing Kurulubedda dwellings. Due to the lack of communication and not exceeding your expectation we agreed to refund the money back, which is against the policy followed by the hotel. Thank you again for bringing forward your feedback. 

We sincerely apologetic that we have not given the service of our traditional Jetwing Sri Lankan hospitality and genuine service from the heart which we are certain would have led to a wonderful stay with us. We hope you will give us another chance to welcome you back to Jetwing Kurulubedda, Galle,

And I checked in y'day looking forward for an awesome stay. 

So we went there parked on the garden of a private property.The photo below is the entrance to the place, they say they will take you on a boat ride to this place, which is an utter lie. We had to walk on the side of a huge construction site, a one foot walking path full of mud and pebbles and cement, surrounded by noises of constructions (mind you not the birds they talk of). Thoroughly disappointed we went to the villa, which is on the side of a small house, not even separated by a wall Or a hedge.. And they can jolly well see you at the balcony. Such privacy!!! We stayed a few minutes just shocked! 

I mean what a lie they carry out?? It's an open space and u wonder with all those people working around is this even safe to stay!! What are they thinking? They should have closed down the place until the constructions are over, we don't pay  our hard earned money on jokers like this to fool us. I called jetwing three times before I checked in and no one bother to mention about the constructions. My husband and I decided to leave immediately. So we we to jetwing light house to give us a solution. There solution was even more hilarious, a deluxe room at light house (which is half the price we paid for- and mind you they don't refund the rest of the money) or a room at jetwing era beach. Of course they don't understand that we wanted less populated place with a private pool. When I demanded only they consider there suite. Which again did not fulfill our requirements. After wasting our time , ruining our mood, the joy of birthday celebrations and lot of argument they agreed to refund our money back.. 

This is the worst experience we had.  Thank you jetwing for ruining our day, my surprise for my husband... It's time you close down the place till your renovations are over and change your whole profile in to what you actually offer rather than drawing a fake picture in peoples' minds..
 
Think about the people who actually stay coz they are helpless since they have paid money, and bcz some does not know what to do, or couples who come on their honeymoon! Is this the quality of a boutique hotel you show out to tourists who come to Sri Lanka?

1. They are under construction. Jetwing management really needs to understand that the clientele that comes here come for some peace, quiet and serenity. Not to walk through a construction site, and have 20 or so workers stare at you while you jump in the pool. If they need to expand, then shut the place down, finish construction and reopen. It's that simple. How can you charge such a premium and expect guests to put up with a half done property, noise and intrusion??

2. Sort out parking. Using Mr. Siripalas' house next door is not the answer. Either have your own park or ferry the guests to and fro. 

3. Villa 1 has a salubrious view of the neighbors house. How far was that thought out? If you are selling seclusion, at the very least grow a hedge! 

4. Nowhere on their website was it mentioned that they were under construction. And when we brought this up, the alternative accommodation we were offered came nowhere near the value paid for KB. 

We didn't stay 5 minutes. Got a refund and left.

Your observations and issues mentioned have my full attention. The nearby villagers have so far created no disturbance to our guests until mentioned by you in this review. Going through older reviews of previous guests, I hope you agree with me. But nevertheless, do accept my apologies in this regard. I will most certainly inquire about this matter with immediate effect.

So while one side of the view from the villa looks exactly like the photos with greenery, over your shoulder you'd see construction and of course somebody's backyard. 
Don't get me wrong; the food is good and the staff is very friendly and helpful.

First of all allow me to thank you for taking your valuable time to bring to our attention the recent experiences you had with the Kurulubedda reservation. I have gone through your comments and would like to assure you that it has our full attention.
 
Jetwing Kurulubedda, a property consisting of only 02 Villas, attracts endless attention of all local and foreign guests. Therefore the villas fully booked most of the time, especially during weekends. Due to a system error your reservation resulted as an over-booking.
 
The team at Jetwing Lighthouse tried to make sure that you don’t feel completely disappointed with our hospitality. Our intention was to render excellent service to you by making the weekend an extra special one.

It must have been very frustrating for you to wait several days for someone to inform you on the status of your refund for that I am extremely sorry, if I were in your situation I’m sure I’d feel just as you do.
 
I make this an opportunity to extend my humble apologies on behalf of the Jetwing Lighthouse team for the inconveniences faced by you. We hope these isolated incidents will not deter you from visiting us again.

My wife booked Kurulubedda and received a confirmation email and her credit card was charged. So despite not receiving a reply to another email and being unable to contact them over the phone on the day of check in we assumed the booking was confirmed. 

Upon arriving at Jetwing Lighthouse we were informed that Kurulubedda was full and offered a room at Lighthouse. We had read the previous reviews and even joked about it happening to us, but assumed they would have rectified any issues being a major hotel chain. But on the first afternoon of a long weekend the joke was on us. And we were not alone as several other couples appeared to be in the same situation and left with their weekend plans ruined. Since our intention was to spend a weekend in a quiet place away from large crowds we declined the offer of a room at Lighthouse despite the best efforts of the staff to convince us otherwise. They then agreed to refund our payment first thing the following week. 

However since no refund or communication was received the following week, my wife emailed Jetwing to be told that the refund will be take 7 working days. However, 8 working days since the incident we are yet to receive a refund or any further communication.

Obviously they do not seem to think there is a major problem since this is not an isolated case but something that is happening repeatedly. I cannot understand how they think that people who booked a private chalet would be happy staying in a large hotel during a long weekend. Maybe they feel that with no options most people would just take the room and forget the incident. The complete incompetence in handling booking and the lack of communication and professionalism in resolving the issue has convinced me to never stay in a Jetwing property again.","Never again!","2014-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1575321-r229469249-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Jetwing Kurulubedda is our hidden wilderness gem. It is a private two villa property located in the middle of a mangrove forest partially surrounded by the “ging ganga”, one of Sri Lankan’s main water arteries. It is also partially surrounded by a typical Sri Lankan village, based around a temple less than a hundred meters away.

It is a truly unique property unlike any other. Yes, there are mosquitoes outside. As it’s a property within a riverside forest, this is to be expected. However, your room is sealed and air-conditioned for this exact reason. Mosquito nets are provided on your terrace should you wish to spend the night outdoors. No, there are no gardens, however this is very much part and parcel of the concept of Jetwing Kurulubedda which is a greatly self sufficient property growing a majority of the fruits and vegetables used in its cooking and offered to its guests. As is evident by all the other reviews, all our guests love the truly unique location, concept and the personalized care Jetwing Kurulubedda offers. We are truly sorry you did not feel the same way. 

We are glad we were able to accommodate you in another of our fine properties a little closer to your liking and we do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay in Sri Lanka’s amazing southern coast.

Sincerely,

General Manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mahamudali Mawatha, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"Mahamudali Mawatha","","1575321","6.048269","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.19604","Jetwing Kurulubedda","414","4.6","12","8","18","64","312","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d1575321-Reviews-Jetwing_Kurulubedda-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.jetwinghotels.com","2012-01-02","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","1","Cleanliness","1","Service","4","Sleep Quality","1","Please do not book this place.

For our dinner, we spent around LKR 11,000, which is a significant amount. Despite this, the portion sizes were far from adequate. We found ourselves still hungry throughout the night, which really affected our experience.

Given the cost, we expected much more in terms of quantity and quality. The lack of sufficient food made us feel like we didn’t get value for our money.

The food was just tasteless, even the meat items tasted very odd. The Sri Lankan corner was a huge disappointment with only red rice and nearly 4–5 brinjal dishes in the buffet.

The fruits were ridiculous; there wasn't even a decent variety, just papaya, watermelon, and very few passion fruits.

All meat items except for braised beef and chicken supreme. I can't begin to explain how awful the taste was; they couldn't even season it.

The noodle chicken mushroom soup was a perfect crap pot. Most items were made from canned items.

I'm very surprised to learn that Sri Lankan cuisine could be such an utter disappointment. I'm a very regular diner at Colombo City hotels. Marino's lunch was not even close to mediocre.

It was just like they put a spread out because they had to. Please get chefs to eat what they cook.

This was my very first experience, and this will be my very last.

Even thinking about the lunch experience gives me a headache. I was in fact scared to taste the food because the awful taste just scared me off of trying.","Qualityless","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d14106301-r956357556-Marino_Beach_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

I booked for a 4 day trip to discover Sri Lanka and relax. I arrived early in the morning and of course I did not expect to be able to check in, I informed reception that I will take breakfast and stay at the pool till room is ready.
I went for breakfast nice location, attentive service and decent buffet selection. By luck my room was ready around 11am and could check in. I requested for a room with no connecting room but got allocated to a room connecting (can happen) 30 min later got a different room.
As I left the night before from Abu Dhabi I did not sleep and went to sleep. 
Around 2pm I woke up from a strong stomach pain further more some loud drilling was happening just in front of my room (some construction happening next to the elevator).
I went to the pool hopping the pain will go and to be away from the drilling but 30 min later I started to get cold sweat and feeling really dizzy. 
From then I could not move from the room/bathroom and was feeling really sick to the point that at 10 pm I went with difficulty by my self to the emergency hospital as the reception could not help. 
After a terrible night I got woken up in the morning again from the drilling happening in front of my room. Still sick I went downstair to speak to the manager who got upset at me saying their is a note in the room so that I'm aware of it ! 
I explain to him that not at any point of the booking or check in anyone inform me of it, as well the note was till the 2nd of April and today is the 3rd to what he answered that they got delay so construction had to be for one more day. For the food poisoning he said he will share my feedback to F&B manager, I explained him the only food I consumed since I left UAE at 9pm the day before was the breakfast buffet (I did not eat on the plane) so no doubt on the origin of the food poisoning. (but never got contacted by anyone or check on my well being).
At this point I got enough and asked to cancel my remaining stay and I paid to change my flight back 2 days early. 
As per management they agreed to refund me the 2 night I will not stay but charged me fully for the two night I stayed and refused to give me a complimentary shuttle back to the airport in the early morning (he gave me 50% as a kind gesture however it's still more expensive then an Uber).
Not at any point management show genuine care of the situation. I understand this is not a 5 star hotel but basics of hospitality still need to be maintained. And I'm not an expert but if drilling is planned in advanced at least the room in the vicinity should be blocked for the duration of the construction.
And please have a serious look on the hygiene standard of the buffet / kitchen !","Good hotel but very disappointing experience","2024-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d14106301-r945559804-Marino_Beach_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Having recently stayed here and used my credit card I was upset to learn that my card was used fraudulently many times after I checked out. My credit card company have confirmed that someone at Marino Beach hotel is the likely culprit for the fraud.

I have had no response to the emails I have sent to the hotel about this matter and am still awaiting a refund for checking out after two nights instead of the originally planned six.

Everyone we met in Sri Lanka, outside of this hotel, was kind, helpful and friendly. 
It's disappointing to be ignored by the staff in this hotel regarding a matter that left us in a terrible financial situation in Sri Lanka, as my credit card had to be cancelled.

I normally rent several rooms for my friends and family at least five each time i stay there. I come from the United States and tip the staff generously. I also give the staff chocolates and various gifts each day as I genuinely love their customer care.
But At checking in, they make you wait in line while 2 people wait on one customer. Don’t greet you properly and their only purpose is to ensure they are following the rules provided to them by management. Thus giving poor service to the customer.
I saw them being clearly racist and serving a foreigner before serving a local customer.
I saw a manager blow his nose in the restaurant in the dish area and not washing his hands prior to serving someone at the buffer. They embarrassed my son in the restaurant in front of his new bride saying you must pay before sitting down with his parents so he had to run upstairs to grab his wallet while his wife sat on a bench so when I approached my daughter in law they told me i had to pay for her before she could sit with us in front of so many patrons which was embarrassing. I threw a US $100 bill at her and brought my daughter in law bach with me to our table. I complained and got sorry sir replies. They wouldn’t allow my friends to join me for dinner at the chinese restaurant rooftop saying it was for hotel guests only?? Of course they allowed my white friends without questions but stopped the locals.
The economy is going down Marino Beach and if you want to stay in this modern world stop being biased and racist!
Also the straw, my wife is going to Sri Lanka to help with one of my daughters in law’s emigration to the US so i booked a room for her and sent a message that she would arrive at 5am and they replied that check in time was 2pm.

Having stayed here twice before, l have to stay we most definitely won't be staying here again. You just feel that the priority here is making as much money as possible from the guests! Maybe I'm old fashioned but l always felt that decent hotels made you feel special and nothing was ever too much. My wife and I didn't get that feeling at any time. The first issue was the bath tub, which gave way underneath me, while I was standing, soaping my body. Both of my feet went through the bottom as what looked like very thin plywood coated in plastic gave way. At this point I'd like to suggest I'm 5'10"" and 90 kgs. So I wouldn't class myself as particularly big. It was just the cheapest material that this bath could have been made from, which you don't expect in a 4.5 star rated hotel! The material ripped quite a big gash in the back of my heel, which needed treatment. As the half full bath emptied at a very quick rate, l suddenly thought about the electric wiring for the ceiling below. (We were on the 7th floor) this was very stressful. Fortunately the water remained in our room, l believe as it appeared to drain off via the shower outlet.
We were offered a miserly free breakfast for our troubles, which I found slightly insulting. I suggested a free spa for both my newly wed wife and myself, which the lobby manager just laughed at. We didn't find it funny or thought my request was a greedy one.
The lobby manager said he would ask his boss. We heard nothing back from him! 
We were duly moved to another room, similar to the one we had. Needless to say we only used the shower and kept well away from the bath. On our final night l wanted to see a football match on the tv. I had bought my firestick for this purpose but didn't anticipate the limited number of power sockets. I needed either a twin adapter plug or a small extension lead. I was told in no uncertain terms that guests weren't allowed either of these. So my wife and I headed into Colombo to purchase one. During this mission, whilst I was getting an extension lead, my wife was waiting in a local Uber tuk tuk. The driver had no patience to wait (10 minutes) for my return. We wanted the same tuk tuk to return us to the hotel. The driver started screaming absenities at my wife and threatened to beat her with a stick if she didn't pay him immediately. I came out to this commotion, which was really nasty and upsetting. Needless to say the driver was sent packing with a flea in his ear! My point is, we didn't have to experience this had the hotel simply loaned us a stupid little adaptor plug. On the day of our departure l spoke with the checkout desk again bringing up the possibility of a free spa, which was flatly declined (apparently the was run by a different company) we were offered a complementary lunch and a delayed check out until 17.00.
We accepted and all l can say is that it was just as well our checkout was delayed because we waited well over an hour to receive our food order!! When it arrived it was dried out and lukewarm. All this did was strengthen our resolve never to return again. Why do so called up market establishments treat their guests so shabbily? Do they not realise we have a choice and now thankfully a voice?","This hotel is all about making as much money as possible from it's guests.

This hotel is conveniently located in the Galle Road closer to many shopping areas. Additionally, the hotel is connected (or rather in the same building of) to Marino Mall, which is a shopping mall owned by the hotel's parent company itself. We briefly did some shopping in the mall, and although it is not big as some of the malls in the area, it had decent number of shops.

The hotel has a nice rooftop garden and a pool. I think despite of some minor 
noises from the surrounding, many would enjoy this rooftop. Sadly due to our schedule were unable to enjoy this view at night, but I would imagine this would be a perfect location for a romantic date after the sunset.

However, I think they have room to improve in several aspects. We were disappointed about the service of the hotel's staff. We noticed a lack of warmth and professionalism from many of the staff we encountered. I don't know whether this situation is only common to local guests, but we would expect much more friendliness, warmth, and professionalism from a hotel of this caliber. I would suggest the hotel to improve their staff training.

We only had breakfast from the hotel, although there were few food items with good flavor, we noticed a considerable lack of quality (flavor and freshness) of many food items available. Also the number of varieties in the hotel breakfast buffet is also limited. 

I think the cleanliness and the quality of Wi-Fi can also be improved in the hotel. 

However, considering the premium location and the views, I think this hotel is suitable for a short staycation.","Conveniently located with nice sea views","2023-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d14106301-r874228677-Marino_Beach_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

It is rank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"On arrival was somewhat amused at the faux golden, plastic, ‘palatial’ interior design and furnishings.  With numerous cheesy,  ‘oil painting’ photos which paradoxically add to the sterile atmosphere, this gaff is all chintz.

Our ‘Graeme Thomson’ bedroom was well appointed, with comfy bed, fine cotton bedding and a single sink bathroom with double jacuzzi. However after using the jacuzzi, the bathroom floor was flooded.  Assumed it had happened due to water overflowing the tub so spent next 20 minutes moping up with towels as assumed it our fault.

Went down to dinner, explained the mopped up flood to the manager who said engineer would take a look. Turned out it was a leaking fitting in the jacuzzi and not down to us at all. Could have done without the bathroom flood stress not of our making.

And so to dinner.  Firstly, the wine list was very expensive which I wouldn’t have minded if there had been some quality wines there but it was mostly cheap Ozzie bargain basement plonk. Fizzy water it was that night.

Onto the food. The tuna fish salad starter was very school dinners - some tiny scraps of tinned tuna flaked onto a highly acidic lettuce salad.

The mid course of lentil soup was served warmish and decent but uninspiring.

The main course was very poor. Cold reheated grey chicken with cool mashed potato. The chicken frankfurter was a bizarre site on my plate but at least vaguely edible by comparison to the foul chicken. Two tiny sprigs of broccoli nestled next to three minute fingers of carrot were edible but not at all satisfying as such a small portion.

Lastly dessert, I specifically asked for the apple crumble to be well heated ie hot but one minute later out came a small apple pie, fridge cold. Now things were starting to grate a little.

We then attempted to order a packed breakfast for the next morning as we were headed out at 5.30am for the much anticipated Horton Plains hike. The chef very enthusiastically offered us chicken sandwiches.  Alarm bells now rang. Went through it a few times and finally succeeded in securing boiled eggs, plastic cheddar cheese, plastic buns, a banana, some dried nutty biscuits, small juice and water.

Left hotel very early next morning at 5.30am for Horton Plains which I’d highly recommend if you like hiking and an epic view from a great height.   This is the main reason to visit bijou Nerawa Eliya as not much else of interest in the town except Victoria Park.

On return to the hotel 6 hours later we found our room had not been cleaned.  When my wife complained, the manager claimed that the waiter had asked me at 5.30am if I wanted our room making up. Bit of a misunderstanding there as indeed the waiter had mumbled something but I thought he’d asked if we wanted anything further?  Why oh why, in the absence of a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign would a hotel ask you if you wanted your room making up? 

Upshot now was we’d lost faith in the kitchen and the hotel’s hospitality.

Later that afternoon the apologetic staff persisted in offering us afternoon tea or a drink. It felt like a gesture of goodwill but on departure the next morning I was amazed to be presented with a bill for the beer.

Sri Lanka has so much fine food and warm hospitality to offer the weary traveller but sadly for us not at the Westbury ‘Palace’.  Basil Fawlty has unfortunately popped up at the Westbury.

Our bedroom was comfortable and the double jacuzzi bath a nice feature but the decor throughout - faux Georgian furniture, fake fireplaces, strange, unidentified portraits and Bridgerton style piped music in the weird, windowless dining room is tasteless and tacky.  The real issue though was the food.  The tuna salad starter comprised a few flakes of tinned tuna with lettuce, my husband’s main course chicken was grey and tasted distinctly reheated while the accompanying ‘sausage Buckhurst’ was an anaemic frankfurter, the mash was cold and my fish resembled school dinners.   Furthermore, the next day we arrived back after a 5.30am start and 6 mile hike on Horton Plains (awesome views - a must do) to find our room had not yet been cleaned though the hotel was virtually empty.  The outdoor pool is pleasant enough and there’s a lot of hovering from well meaning staff but the Westbury is far from palatial.

vielen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, Ihre Eindrücke mit uns zu teilen. Wir schätzen es sehr, dass Sie unser Resort erneut besucht haben, und freuen uns, dass Sie die Betreuung durch unsere Ärzte und Therapeuten als ausgezeichnet empfunden haben.

Es tut mir jedoch leid zu erfahren, dass Ihre jüngste Erfahrung nicht vollständig Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat. Bitte erlauben Sie mir, einige Punkte zu klären, die möglicherweise Missverständnisse verursacht haben.

Zunächst möchte ich in Bezug auf das Ereignis mit dem Straßenhund betonen, dass unserem Personal das Wohl der Tiere am Herzen liegt und dem Hund kein Schaden zugefügt wurde. Wir behandeln alle Tiere mit Respekt und Sorgfalt, und unser Sicherheitsteam würde niemals solche Maßnahmen ergreifen. Wir verstehen, dass Tiere in neuen Umgebungen manchmal beschützend reagieren, und bemühen uns stets, solche Situationen mit größtmöglicher Rücksicht zu handhaben.

Bezüglich der WLAN-Netzwerke schätzen wir es, dass die Sensibilität gegenüber elektromagnetischen Signalen für manche Gäste von großer Bedeutung ist. Unser Team ist darauf geschult, dies zu berücksichtigen, und wir sind stets bestrebt, für alle eine ruhige Umgebung zu schaffen. Wir bedauern jegliche Störungen, die Sie möglicherweise wahrgenommen haben, und werden mögliche Anpassungen prüfen, um Interferenzen für zukünftige Aufenthalte zu minimieren.

Schließlich möchten wir uns für die Nachfrage zu den Überweisungsbelegen und die Abschiedsarrangements entschuldigen, falls diese als aufdringlich oder unwillkommen empfunden wurden. Unser Ziel war es lediglich, sicherzustellen, dass vor Ihrer Abreise alles in Ordnung ist, da wir stets transparente Abläufe und klare Abrechnungen anstreben. Wir verstehen, dass diese Situationen stressig wirken können, und nehmen Ihre Rückmeldungen ernst, um unsere Abläufe zu verbessern.

Wir schätzen Ihr ehrliches Feedback sehr und sind entschlossen, diese Anliegen anzugehen, damit all unsere Gäste einen ruhigen und erholsamen Aufenthalt genießen können. Nochmals vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihre Erfahrungen mit uns geteilt haben.

Leider haben einige Dinge diesen Aufenthalt überschattet.

Ein mit dem Haushund Lilly angefreundeter (einsamer, trauriger) Strassenhund wurde aufgrund eines einmaligen Bellens uns gegenüber von dem angestellten Security Mitarbeiter getötet(!).

Aus unserer Sicht wollte er nur das Hotel beschützen und war in keinster Weise aggressiv. Zuvor hatten beide Hunde miteinander auf dem Hotelgelände gespielt und der Strassenhund war sehr zutraulich.

Aus unserer Sicht ist das ein NO GO. 

Wir haben das auch Jan dem Gästebetreuer kommuniziert. Es erfolgte leider keine Reaktion.

Der zweite Punkte waren 3 Wochen Schlafstörungen aufgrund von 5 (!) WLAN- Netzen nachts im Schlafzimmer. 
Auch das haben wir dem Inhaber und Jan mitgeteilt, dass das ein wichtiges Thema für uns ist, da wir beide wegen körperlicher Themen mit der Aussicht auf Gesundung diese strapaziöse Reise auf uns genommen haben.
Leider keine Änderung.

Der dritte Punkt war auch interessant, als der Inhaber am letzten (!) Aufenthaltstag unsere Überweisungsbelege unter Druck anforderte, die wir ca 4 Wochen zuvor überwiesen hatten.

Zu guter Letzt zeigte sich Jan noch passiv aggressiv indem er die übliche Abschiedszeremonie versagte , da wir kommunizierten kein TIP zu geben für einzelne Mitarbeiter.

Da wir aufgrund dieser Punkte immer wieder gestresst wurden, war die Panchakarma Kur leider nicht sehr effektiv.

Ergo: 
Strahlensensiblen ist ein Aufenthalt nicht zu empfehlen
Tötung von Strassenhunden stresst extrem

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at Hilton Yala Resort. We sincerely regret that your experience did not meet expectations and appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.

Regarding your check-in and payment process, we apologize for any miscommunication. As your stay consisted of back-to-back reservations booked using points, our system required a re-check-in and incidental payment for the new reservation. This was explained upon arrival and kindly reminded before your safari. However, as this was not completed, our team had to request the payment to proceed with the check-in. Additionally, we regret the oversight in selecting the incorrect currency when processing your payment, which resulted in the transaction being declined.

For clarification, the 25% Hilton Diamond discount was applied to the food charges. Upon further review, the same discount was also extended to the beverage items. The revised total before taxes and service charges amounted to LKR 49,275.00, and after applying the applicable 34.34% taxes and service charge (LKR 16,921.04), the correct final total was LKR 66,196.04.

Initially, an incorrect amount of LKR 75,129.64 was charged to your Amex card. To rectify this, a credit card refund of LKR 8,933.61 was processed, ensuring that the final amount charged was correctly adjusted to LKR 66,196.03. The voided transaction details were shared with you via WhatsApp on the same day.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the room temperature. Our engineering team inspected the system, and to ensure your comfort, an alternative room was offered solely for the purpose of sleeping, so you could rest comfortably without needing to pack and unpack your belongings. You would have been able to return to your original room in the morning and pack at your convenience before check-out. Your feedback has been shared with our team to improve service and provide a more seamless resolution process in the future.

Regarding your service experience, we regret that you felt uncomfortable during the payment process. Our intention was never to inconvenience you, and we will be reviewing our approach to ensure a more guest-friendly resolution in similar situations.

As a gesture of goodwill, we were pleased to offer a complimentary dessert during your dinner on February 25th. We truly value your loyalty as a Hilton Diamond member and sincerely hope to welcome you back for a more seamless experience in the future.

Please do not hesitate to reach out should you require any further assistance.

1. Hilton Diamond member privilege
(a) I presented my Hilton credit card for incidental charges at check-in (Feb 24); however, the front desk staff informed me that the credit card deposit was not necessary., I was assured that I could settle the charges upon my departure check-out.  As a Hilton Diamond member, the front desk staff recognized my Diamond member status and acknowledged the 25% discount on Food & Beverage and Spa service.  
(b) On the 2nd day (Feb 25) when I returned to the resort in the evening after the safari tour, the front desk informed me that my credit card (credit card record from Hilton booking portal) declined the dinner transaction on Feb 24. The staff requested my credit card to settle the dinner payment.  Since I didn’t carry my credit card in the resort, I asked if I could pay the dinner bills altogether at check-out tomorrow (Feb 26), the staff insisted I must resolve the payment immediately.  After the dinner, the front desk staff took the credit card machine with him and accompanied me to my room.  At my room, the front desk staff showed me the total amount of 75,129.64 LKR to be billed which includes 2 dinner payment - tonight's dinner (Feb 25) and last night's dinner (Feb 24) payment; however, my credit card was declined, so I asked him to try it again, the 2nd attempt was successful.  Later, I received an email alert message from the credit card company that the amount of 75,129.64 USD was declined due to exceeding my credit limit.  In reality, there was nothing wrong with my credit card.  The front desk staff charged the incorrect currency which is why the payment couldn’t be processed. 
(c) At check-out on Feb 26, I reported to the front desk that the Diamond member 25% discount on Food & Beverage was not given to the Beverage items on both Feb 24 and Feb 25 dinner.  The front desk staff reviewed my bills and confirmed the errors, the correct amount should have been 49,275.00 LKR, and it was processed to my credit card right away.  The front desk staff told me that they will void the transaction of the incorrect amount of 75,129.64 LKR and will send me a receipt.  As of today March 7, I still have not received the void receipt.

2. Malfunction AC system
(a) The room temperature remained at 20 celsius degrees.  The temperature was unable to be adjusted, it could not be set to my desired temperature at 25 celsius degrees and as a result, I had to turn off the AC system during my 2-night stay. While I appreciate the General Manager's apology, I am disappointed that no compensation was offered for the significant inconvenience I experienced at a 5-stars Hilton resort. 
(b) I reported about the freezing cold room temperature on both the first and second days of my stay.  Despite confirmation that a technician had inspected the issue, the AC system was not repaired. The front desk offered an alternative room for sleeping only, which I declined due to the impracticality of packing and unpacking my belongings for a single night.

3. Bad Customer Service 
(a) Furthermore, I was insulted by the handling of my payment.  Being escorted to my room to settle the bill a day before departure due to a front desk error is unacceptable.  If the matter was urgent, I should have been informed at breakfast on the second day when the credit card rejection occurred.  This level of customer service is unacceptable for a 5-star establishment.","Terrible and Unpleasant","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r997006831-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback following your recent stay at Hilton Yala Resort. We sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered and the disappointment you felt during your visit.

Regarding the welcome experience, our records indicate that the reservation was made for four adults, and the welcome amenities, including face towels, were prepared accordingly. We regret any inconvenience caused by this oversight.

Our lobby is infused with our signature Hilton Yala essence, designed to provide a unique and pleasant ambiance. We are sorry that it did not meet your expectations.

We take your feedback about the food quality very seriously. Our executive sous chef and the F&B manager spoke to your group during lunch, offering replacement food items and dishes outside our menu to accommodate your preferences. At dinner, our F&B manager again assisted your group with choices. Finally, at check-out, our Front Office Manager spoke to your group, and it was during this conversation that the gentleman in your group aggressively raised his voice, leading us to discontinue the discussion professionally.

We apologize if the western menu items did not meet your tastes, though we are glad to hear that the Sri Lankan Kottu Roti was a delight.

From the moment we arrived, the lack of a proper welcome was noticeable. With six of us, only four face towels were provided, leaving two of us waiting. The reception area had an unpleasant smell, which added to the disappointing start. Lunch was a disaster; not a single dish was palatable. Even after informing the waitress, the food quality did not improve. The glasses provided for water had a very unpleasant smell, and the replacements were just as bad. During dinner, an iced mocha was watery, and the replacement was equally terrible. Dinner was a nightmare, even worse than lunch. The staff's mocking attitude towards our complaints was unprofessional, and the absence of managerial intervention was a letdown. We left without having breakfast, utterly dissatisfied. I strongly advise against choosing this hotel for your stay. It is truly disappointing to receive such poor service from a Hilton property. The property itself is beautiful, but the staff needs better training, and the food quality must be significantly improved to match the property’s potential.","Unsatisfactory stay","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r959414337-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us on TripAdvisor. We sincerely value your recognition of the outstanding service provided by our Food & Beverage team, chef, bellmen, and buggy crew. Your acknowledgment of their commitment to delivering memorable hospitality is deeply appreciated.

We consider all guest reviews as constructive input that assists us in refining our services. While we are pleased to learn of your positive experiences, we are also attentive to the areas where we may have fallen short of your expectations, resulting in a rating of 1.

Upon closer examination of your concerns, we recall the incident involving your detour through Yala National Park boundary and the subsequent assistance required when your vehicle became stuck in mud. While we do not maintain a fleet of safari jeeps, our ranger team promptly facilitated contact with one of our safari jeep vendors, who traveled a considerable distance to offer aid. We understand that alternative assistance was provided by local residents, resulting in the resort bearing the associated costs, for which we extend our gratitude.

During your stay, we endeavored to ensure your comfort and satisfaction, extending a warm welcome upon your arrival and providing additional accommodations by upgrading two of your rooms to premium pool villas. We regret any oversight in addressing any concerns you may have had during your two-night stay with us.

While it is a beautiful place, and I'm sure has great kitesurfing when the wind is good, we cannot recommend it based on our experience. We stayed during the first week of October and did not have any wind. Of course the resort cannot control this, but it was disappointing nonetheless, and it was their response and the overall vibe we experienced that led us to have such a negative experience. We were picked up at the airport by a driver from KSL who was very professional though quiet and the van was comfortable. Upon arrival at KSL we were met by a few people who took our bags and told us to follow them to our room. Absolutely no one asked our name, asked us to check in or provided any information. They took us to the room and then walked away. We called after them asking if we needed to check in or what to do next, and they said we should come to lunch at 1 and everything would be explained then. We had told the resort ahead of time we wanted to go kitesurfing and one of us needed lessons, and would start that first day. We found a paper in the room saying lessons would leave for the lagoon at 2:30 so we assumed we had some time to figure things out. There was no wind at the resort, but wondered if there might be wind at the lagoon (assuming so since there was no indication that the season had ended and the website suggested there was usually wind through the end of October). At 1 we wandered through the property and entered the area with tables, just assuming this was where lunch would be. There was a large group of people already sitting, talking loudly, laughing, enjoying themselves, speaking French. Not one single person acknowledged us, even looking up let alone saying hello. We assumed they were a group of friends, not interested in making new ones, which was fine, until later that evening and the next day we realized they were the staff! No one spoke to us until we finally struck up a conversation with another guest traveling alone who informed us she had been there 6 days and there had been no wind the whole time. She said there would be no kite surfing that day and this was the only thing that was mentioned to us about it. We asked what else there was to do, and she said we could go swimming or stand up paddling. We wandered down to the beach after lunch, still with no introductions, and found a lone beat up stand up board and paddle. We played in the water for a while and then wandered back to the resort. Decided to have a drink at the bar and the bartender was very friendly - this was a positive. We asked him what else there was to do, and he said ""beer pong."" Needless to say we were not super impressed. We did have a conversation later with another one of the staff who provided us some recommendations for surfing further south. Still no one had acknowledged us checking in, or providing us info on the forecast. At this point we began planning how and when to leave to try out surfing. Over breakfast the next morning (which according to the sign started at 7:30 but was not served until after 8:30 - which is fine, but again, no communication), we ate and planned our departure. During this time someone named Leo from the staff came over and introduced himself to us, asking us our names and our plans (almost 24 hours after we arrived.) He told us to come for him to anything. We told him we were thinking of leaving, unless he thought the wind would come up. He left to check the forecast and came back, saying the wind looked good. My boyfriend went to look with him and realized the day he was referring to that was ""good"" was Thursday (we were scheduled to leave Wednesday). We told him we would leave and head to Hirikitiya, and asked about helping with a ride. We had a ride website we were using so had an idea of price, but told the staff if someone in the area needed business we would be happy to use them. They started arranging things and quoted us a price. We agreed and went to pack. When we returned it was the same van we came from the airport in, and they told us the price was actually much higher because we were going to Hirikitiya and not Galle. At no point did we tell them we were going to Galle so we have no idea why they would have quoted us a price to Galle. Another frustration. 

SO overall not a great experience. As for the positives: we liked the room and the outdoor bathrooms are awesome. The bartenders were friendly and the beer was good. The property is great and I'm sure it's a great place to kitesurf when their is wind. Unfortunately after less than 24 hours there, the vibe was so unwelcoming and frankly we felt misled as we later looked at their instagram account and it appeared they were well aware the season had ended early and did not share this with us. Sadly we would not return.","Sadly disappointed","2018-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r627314897-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Dil here (Owner). I did a full check into this to ascertain what happened. 

I can vouch that none of the staff tried to switch your bill.  

I can say that none of our staff tried to take any action against you. I cannot however control others who were there and witnessing the accusations you had made. 

We keep the parties open for outsiders - foreign and local alike. We don't ask for any entrance fees (you were'nt a guest of the hotel). We also continue to do it to promote fellowship and not look at these as a profit making venture. 

Anyway, I have put more controls in place so that no un-pleasantries occur in the future. In fact 2 nights ago, we ran another party and I mentioned what you had said so that there are no misunderstandings etc etc.

Just taking my time to write this review due to a unfortunate event that occur last days I have been there so at least I know that the owners will take the matter serious. 

In general the environment created at KiteLanka is great (pricy but great) - from guests to staff. 

But during last beach party the bartender tried to switch the 5k bill I gave him for a 1k, thinking that I was drunk.  Well. I took it easy but insisted until he gave me full change. In the process another guest told me the same happened to him. 
We talk and I mentioned that I was going the bring the topic to management. So. A friend of the bartender appears super angry and start threating to beat me up. 
At the moment I let it go since I preferred to enjoy the party. But still. Wanted to leave this noted here for things like this do not happen again.

My gf and i were on a backpack trip in Srilanka and decided to visit Kitesurfing Lanka for the last 3/4 days since firstly i kitesurf, secondly knew people working there, was a chance to meet up (with no any offense to them)
here below are the pros and cons of the stay: 
pros: 
-spacious rooms and bathrooms along with the terrace. 
-Some of the staff is nice and friendly like Mickey, tikiri, zac, Ola and Sebastien.  

Cons: 
- When we arrived the first night there, we spoke with more than 4 people, contributing in the management and told them that tomorrow morning, i will be assisting my gf with her riding skills (who cannot ride upwind 100%) and rent equipment for both, Noting that some of them knew that i was an assistant instructor. And of course, everyone smiled and encouraged me to do that. However, the next day, after arriving to the spot, the guy responsible for the rental did not allow to rent for her equipment because she does not ride upwind 100%. We don't mind putting your own rule, we totally respect that but just be clear from the beginning and be straight forward other than being a hypocrite. She had to go back to the camp and pay her own TukTuk because swimming there is a no go zone. 
-the conditions of the Big Lagoon are very normal, not as mentioned in the website. Buffalo's Poo is everywhere when setting up the lines and kite and the wind is very gusty. the center offers only water. 
- DON'T wash your harness in their Tank, it is disgusting. Green Color and viscous. 
- On your way to the reception, the odor next to the toilet is unbearable. I did not find it clean as a place compared to other accommodation in SriLanka.
- FOOD is way below average in terms of quality and variety, also not as mentioned in the website. Breakfast was literally the same for three consecutive days. Ohh and the Bell that they ring for food time makes me feel like at a ""cantine"" or school for sheep. 
-Most important One: THE VELLA ISLAND! What a joke really. Way over exaggerated. 
however, I have to say conditions are perfect for kiting, constant wind and huge space for flat water. 
So here is the story with the Organizer called ""Amin"" the Moroccan cheesy guy! 
The trip was on Thursday and Friday. Customers have an option to return Thursday night or Friday night. We talked with the guy which also sounded very nice on Wed night to subscribe our names and automatically decided to put us for two nights. Around 10pm, my gf and i decided to change for one night but Amin was already disappeared and thought he might be sleeping. We thought that there is no problem to tell him the next day morning, NO BIG DEAL. The day is for 45 EUROS BTW, SO EXPENSIVE compared what is being offered. So the next day morning, we told him that we wanted to go back on the same day and suddenly turned into an evil and saying : No it's impossible. Whether you go for two days or you can't go. This conversation occurred literally before 5 min leaving the truck. His argument was that only one boat was returning back and is already full. so we said, ""what if someone gets injured or get sick?"" he replied this is another issue. 
So we decided to go since we had no option and will see if we can manage to talk to people there and manage our return. When we arrived there, there was no toilet, no non-salty water for a quick shower, beds are like WW1 and the food was below normal, equal to 200 rupees maximum/person. Plus, no beach boys to help you. I personally launched and landed kites of customers/ friends more than Amin did for the whole day because he was busy teaching and earning money. Meanwhile, we have found a fisherman to get us back for 5000 rupees +tuktuk. Also, we found once we got back that one of the instructors was returning on that ""full boat"" and we as customers are at the end of priority list just for this Amin don't pay an extra boat for two people. Very unprofessional and cheesy guy! Of course, we told the reception the story and there was no positive response whatsoever. 
Oh and the first aid box is horrible! don't take the risk to try new tricks at that place as no professional backup plan is taken into consideration. 
- Internet was barely working for the whole stay, it was frustrating to use it. 

Anyway, i am writing this in order not to complain about the money i spent, (it s my last concern) but on how this place cash cow money from customers while giving a smile. Such an abusive behavior and you can feel it.","Disappointing Stay","2017-05","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1404719-d3335783-r489298769-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html",

Last minute booking. 

A very unfair review by you having got in touch with you within a few hours on phone and mail and explained that you booked late night and by morning we were already full. You said you were cool with it. Nevertheless looks like you were not. 

We are in discussion with booking.com to do away with any last minute bookings that can be generated from their site.

Sorry you had this experience having booked through a booking engine.

The issue of booking.com is being rectified at the moment to make it more clear. 

The rooms booked were 2 X tent units which has pictures of them as well including the outdoor showers etc. The tents were booked and available when you came but the issue was that you were expected a bungalow. 

1. The team tried to find you two rooms outside the camp, however when we finally were able to suggest them, you had left 
2. We welcomed you, offered lunch to the whole group free of charge
3. We refunded your advance payment, even though we lost the income that could have been generated through your booking in our peak season
4. We apologized and offered to reimburse you fuel costs and offered you a stay at our hotel on a later day for free (this was via e mail the next day)

Sorry once again, was very unfortunate and hopefully would never happen again.

The owners were not on site. 

He then gave us the owner’s number and when I explained the situation to him I was told that he would look for another hotel nearby.

We were with our cousins who were with 2 babies who also booked the same standard room and was given a tent with common toilet facilities.

Thanks for taking time to write a review. Sorry to hear your experience was not up to standard inspite of your friends coming back again to the kite camp for the second time in a row. 

I readily accept your feedback about the noise in the morning. We will try and see how this can be minimized. 

Having said your side of the story, I would like to also give our side of the story; 

1. Pricing - Prices have been communicated to your in advance, very clearly (Euro 35 per person full board). We even share photos of the accommodation and common washrooms in order to balance your expectations with what is offered on e mail. As our other guests experienced tents also come with nice bedding, electricity and fans. All your meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner as well as desserts, tea/ coffee) were included in the price. I am not sure you get Cordon Blue, Grilled Fish, Chocolate Mousse etc in a normal kite camp buffet style anywhere else in the world but at our camp you do hence we justify the price with what we offer. Dont forget WIFI and the transport to the kite lagoon at scheduled times. 

2. We have scheduled times for transport to the lagoon in the morning and afternoons. Your statement about flexibility is misleading. We offer scheduled transport - FOC. If you however need transport outside these times you can always request from our staff who will happily arrange a tuk tuk/ jeep/ van for you. For this you pay and prices are fixed so that guests wont get ripped off by the fluctuating prices. 

For the benefit of other readers, the lagoon is 15 minutes drive from our camp. You can also kite in the sea in front of the camp and do a downwinder as well to the kite lagoon (15 minutes). 

3. Airport Taxi - Please understand that we give opportunity to the local village to do the transport service for us. By the time you sent us a mail, the vehicle was already in the airport waiting for you as per your flight details. Your communication was too late - simple. We however tried our best to speak to the drivers to reduce the rate which we did on your bill. 

To go ballistic to my staff was not in the spirit of Kitesurfing Lanka or a kitesurfer. We did our utmost to ensure you had a pleasant time. Your own friends continued to patronize KSL for a reason. If a mistake happened, its normal but please not have all the anger and try to take on someone else. We are civilized and can talk to find a solution - always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dutch Bay Road Kudawa Road, Kalpitiya 61360 Sri Lanka","Kalpitiya","Sri Lanka","61360",,"Dutch Bay Road","Kudawa Road","3335783","8.215762","Kalpitiya, North Western Province","79.71677","Kitesurfing Lanka | Resort","694","4.8","4","9","18","83","580","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1404719-d3335783-Reviews-Kitesurfing_Lanka_Resort-Kalpitiya_North_Western_Province.html","http://www.kitesurfinglanka.com","2013-07-25","OTHER","2",,"Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","3","Cleanliness","3","Service","3","Sleep Quality","1","It is extremely overpriced for a tent.

I paid full price only to arrive and find out the spa is closed for renovations. The pool is under renovation. In fairness they said they could heat it for me but it isn't close to a reasonable temperature for the climate and takes hours to heat......to say nothing of the construction nails around the deck and the ones that had to be removed from the pool. 

They market that there are fireplaces in the rooms
 Actually, what they have is the type of cheap and ugly fake units one finds at Walmart for sub division homes. 

The shower head in the room at its highest, is about chest height.....and I am 5 foot 7.
the walls and ceilings are paper thin. I can hear everything from the hallway as well as every single movement from the people in the room above me,

If this place was $100 a night. sure it would be great. But I am paying over $350 a night, and that is absurd for what is being offered. 

The view is great. You can get that at many hotels.

The TV in the room was broken and the hotel said due to lightening strike. Plastic water bottles were used and so was not mortivated by a green concept. The location is very nice and staff was very friendly. In fact the staff apologised for having a few staff and the delays. They said they were closing for a major refurnishment.

Location and the some of the services offered, particularly the front office and the waiters, were fantastic. The ambience and the scenic beauty that we could view from our room was spectacular.

Negatives:
Food was a total let down, especially for the price that was charged as a boutique hotel. Both the breakfast and dinner menus not only offered very limited choices but also were quite bland in taste. The food needed more seasoning and this does not mean making the food spicy. Having said that, at a time when only locals were occupied at the hotel then the hotel can easily cater to the Sri Lankan palette. The bakery products tasted stale and were heated in a microwave just before presenting them to the guests, which became rubbery and dry after a few minutes. The set dinner menus lacked taste and the soups that we had throughout the three nights, although they were supposed to be different types, tasted the same and actually tasted like a instant soup made out of a packet. Somehow the Sri Lankan menu, which included string hoppers & milk rice etc., tasted better than the western cuisine. Overall, we felt that all those fresh local ingredients that the hotel could source from were not treated with care to make a delicious dish.","Excellent location with dire need for improvement","2018-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r682598772-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for your feedback. We regret to note that you left the hotel with a complaint. We immediately initiated an inquiry in to the facts mentioned in your review. 

We are really surprised about your comments concerning your stay experience, since, according to the Hotel’s feedback comment sheet filled by you during the time of your stay, you had rated us very highly ticking most of the boxes “Excellent” and “good” .

Our inquiry into the matter revealed that just before arrival you had requested to amend the reservation for 02 nights instead of 03 nights. The hotel had already charged you for 3 nights and subsequently the refund of USD 509.56 was made to Booking.com.

If you need further clarifications, feel free to contact us and we shall email the copies of the transaction advices.

Not enough sun beds for all guests.

Having stayed for 3 days at the hotel with my family I can say that the hotel fell woefully short in many ways than one.

CONS (which regretabally vastly outweigh any pros):

Staff - severely undertrained. They did make the effort to be courteous and helpful but their lack of professional hospitality training was undeniably obvious. 

Food - absolutely sub par. Their attempt to cook western fare borders on the inedible. (Would suggest sticking to Sri Lankan food varieties, which the chef is likely better at, that would satisfy locals and be a novelty for foreign tourists).

Accommodation - nowhere close to the enticing pictures online. The furniture in the rooms are dated, sheets overused and stained. The bathroom showers were screaming for more water pressure. 

PROS:
Location - The hotel is situated in a picturesque locale and is close to Nuwara Eliya.

Premises - The premises were well maintained.

Would advise management to make some major  investment in training staff, in revisiting the food menu and in refurbishing the rooms/bathrooms - otherwise I would sereiusly question the hotels ability to qualify as a luxury “anything” of the world.","Luxury Small Hotel...Really?","2018-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r610715201-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We arrived and were greeted nicely but it literally went down hill from there. We stayed for two nights and I was so close to leaving the hotel early and looking elsewhere. Such a shame because the hotel exterior is beautiful but then it fails in every other way! 

There was no aircon, no ironing board or iron. The lamp shades falling apart. We were rationed to less than one toilet roll a day, no extra roll left in room. I called housekeeping for another roll but they never brought one up. It was also weird that on the second day of our stay all of the cushions on our bed were removed from our bedroom? Why?? We are an older couple. 
The shower tap was difficult to use and floor of shower cracked. The tap in the sink was loose and I was afraid that it might fall off if I used it. The hot water ran out when running the bath tub. This hotel needs some love and a clean inside the shower. At night you can hear everything in the hotel because of the thin walls so don't expect much sleep until all the staff have left. 

On the first day I ordered a cheese platter and an hour and a half later after questioning staff was told they didn't have any and to order something different. 
Staff at the front desk were not trained well and did not understand English - what I was saying but still saying yes?? 
Breakfast was ok but no Sri Lankan meals, just pastries, fruit, eggs and bacon, nothing special for a luxury hotel. The male staff serving us at breakfast was polite. 
The meals for dinner are very pricey and nothing special. 

All in all this is not a luxury hotel. I have stayed in plenty of beautiful luxury boutiques and this is not worth the price to stay. I wish I stayed somewhere else.

Im not sure when SLH last visited but they need to soon.
The sunbeds by pool need replacing, the mattresses on them very badly worn and looked awful.
The rooms were adequate but there really wasn't any luxury, no Mini-Bar, no Air Con.
We had a balcony which was nice, but no chairs to sit on, why.
The Staff were very friendly but not really sure when they had training. We decided to have Dinner in the Restaurant on the first night. Mismatched Wine glasses on the table not really very SLH.  all ordering Chateaubriand, what a treat....Wrong!! Not only was it the worst meal I have ever had I am not sure what cut of Beef it was, certainly not Fillet but our waiter cleared starter plates while our friends were still eating and brought out two Mains and said we had to wait for the others which was odd as we had all ordered exactly the same. The Wine list was virtually non-existant they only seemed to have one bottle of everything.
At first we thought it was funny trying to laugh off all the mistakes but by day three that had worn thin. We tried to complain but were told that there was no General manager on Duty for our entire stay, one  member of Staff said they were on holiday, another that they were at a Conference in Colombo??

1. Location/view: Fantastic (5 out of 5) 

2. Meals: Terrible (1 out of 5) 
First night they organized a buffet out of their usual 4 course meal and there was nothing to eat for the vegetarians. There was not enough food and people had to wait for long time until food arrives. Bread/buns served were not fresh. Food on menu was not labeled, people cannot find the meat until they eat it + many more 

Next day after we complained, they organized the usual 4 course meal, but again not up to the standard, we couldn't eat the salad, bad smell coming from the prawns, many gave up eating the salad and returned it. The main meal was quite small and not really the ideal size for a dinner. Only the soup was good in that meal 

Breakfast buffet was a disaster. The ham and bacon served was beef, there was no chicken, we had to ask for chicken sosages few times and then we got it. This is simply common sense where for a local crowd you need to serve chicken because not many people eat beef. Same situation continued on the second day breakfast 

Both the Manager and the Chef don't have common sense to put up a decent meal/menu where people can eat and have options for all 

3. Service: Poor (2 out of 5)    
People waited until food comes from the kitchen, we had to ask for plates, we had to ask to re-fill the food, we had to ask lot of things, they never think and do things

4. Facilities:  (2 out of 5) Only 8 channels in cable TV in rooms, to see rest of the channels you need to come to the bar. The safety lockers in 2 rooms were broken.  

Overall not a good place to visit, not worth for the money you spent.

Here's the story when I went there for my office trip with 20 of my colleagues for a 2 night stay. 

View

Surrounded by mountains in one side and a tea plantation on the other this is one for the classic Nuwara Eliya views. But not something you can't miss ;)

Food

Day1 Dinner - Instead of the normal dinner they decided to give us a buffet since they though 20 people is too much to cater with their normal buffet and gave us noodles/fried + chopsuey + chicken/pork. That's it. Hello what if I don't eat meet?

Day2 Breakfast - Noodles + egg curry + omelette + potato hash browns + beef. Hello, what if I don't eat beef?

Service
Day1 dinner, some of our team members had to wait in line until they bring soup cups, until they bring plates and until they fill up some dishes. Terrible. They only notices some dishes are empty only when we pointed.

My roommate asked to clean the room when we go out in the morning. Came back at 12.00 PM. Room was not cleaned yet. There was no electricity for about half an hour at that time as well. 

Rooms
The room was up to the standard until I went for a shower. There was a bath tub with a hand shower. The hand shower was not long enough and I either had bend down about 1ft or sit on the bath tub to take a shower :(. The rooms are not soundproof as well.

Staff Friendliness
They were OK until one of the room service members asked me whether my nearby room was empty for cleaning where few of my colleagues were. When I said NO, she let out a sigh with a disappointing face.

All and all, please stay away from this place. There are plenty of good places around with the same quality of view, which is the only thing worth coming here for.","The view is not worth it","2017-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r531022090-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Making the reservations itself was pretty difficult with the pretty lazy and inefficient reservation desk. After many emails, I got it through and was keen to see this place. And also knowing other reviews, I specifically asked them to reserve me an upstairs room.

To my horror, when I called them in the morning on the day I was to check in, they made a big fuss that I cannot get an upstairs room and all upstairs rooms were occupied. With many calls to the hotel and to Colombo office, I manage to win my case having requested myself upstairs room months ago to which they didn't refuse at that time. It was completely a fault of the silly officer in the reservations dept but to her credit, she corrected her miss and swapped us for an upstairs room!

(+) Scenery! That's the only thing this hotel can give. The small garden is well kept.
(+) Friendly staff - sometimes felt sorry for them as they had to make up with pretty old facilities.
(+) Decent pool with hot water.
(+) Nice tea estate adjoining the hotel where you can hike through.

(-) Biggest negativity is the Extraordinary Price for this shabby property which even only serves a limited ala carte menu!
(-) Old and shabby facilities. My room's safe was broken - they took so many tries and time to fix it and later had to replace with another. TV aerial was broken - only 1 or 2 cable channels could work. If you want to see more channels, you have to go to the TV in the bar.
(-) Very poor meals - bread served for starters were old and not fresh. Very limited choices on the menu.
(-) Bikes were broken. Nothing much you can do except for a shaking mini pool table.
(-) This hotel looks underperforming and seems not much interest is given to it by the management to maintain it.
(-) The few small rooms that are on the ground floor have zero scenery!

In fairness the manager did take the feedback and tried to be nice by following up but it's just beyond her; the place is not equipped and they just don't have any luxury standards. I was offered a complementary foot reflexology which was the best service that place could offer.

This is an expensive hotel so definitely not worth the price tag which is a shame because it's in a beautiful location.

The views are indeed lovely, one window overlooks the pool deck and mountains, other window overlooks the hills. But even this view cannot salvage what I have to call a truly poor experience completely not deserving of the SLH brand standards which one expects. The electricity stopped without warning four times over 90 minutes, when that happens, you will also realise this place does not have emergency lighting either in the room nor in the pitch black hallway. NO lights, NO announcements whatsoever, NO working telephone. Guests are left in the dark literally. After the fourth blackout I marched down to reception and was greeted by four blasé looking dudes. No hello good evening are you alright, or even a greeting just blank stares. So I had to ask the obvious, if they noticed the four black outs. Their response was along the lines of oh this is Sri Lanka, blackouts occur. And when asked about the phone, they looked amused and explained like they were talking to an idiot child, that of course the phone also doesn't work as it runs on electricity and it takes a few minutes after the lights for the phone to work again. No apology until I asked why they did not have emergency lights or a backup generator. Finally they said oh yes now they've decided to turn on their backup generator. Sorry. 

YOU EXPECT THIS FROM A USD50/night place, NOT A USD350/night place. By way of service recovery they sent up a plate of stale looking cookies. Wow. I've travelled to lots of developing countries and stayed at far more modest digs, both in Sri Lanka and all across the globe. Not once have I been hit by multiple blackouts in one single night, and not once have I experienced a complete and utter lack of emergency measures such as emergency lighting or an immediate backup generator kicking in. Or such complete apathy from the clueless staff who do not belong in a SLH property. They do not have the finesse or even the polish or niceties you expect from LUXURY. 

On to the ageing rooms. The doors have warped so much they require superhuman strength to slam close and then prise open. Both toilet and room doors have this problem. No bar fridge, no mini bar items, no wine glasses even or cutlery. Cheap looking tea bags and instant coffee packs. No glasses in the toilet either, or even face towels, just two sets of hand towels. One measly set of toiletries, and such thin cheap tissue paper and toilet paper. Even our USD70/night Zinc Journeys in Sirigiya had lovely thick 3-ply purple patterned loo paper. Yes I judge a place on the little extras, but isn't that what luxury prices are meant to afford a weary, pampered traveller?

Breakfast while good, really was staffed by poorly trained young staff who looked like they were constantly scared of spilling something. We asked for an additional platter of some fruit, they simply rejected this, not even offering to do it for a small supplement. Just flat out no. Are fruits so expensive here??? The room was charming, but they also forgot our orders for water, we gave up.

Not looking forward to the electricity situation tonight. ","First world prices, third world service and mod cons ","2017-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r459961783-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your experience following your recent stay at Cinnamon Bentota Beach. We truly appreciate your honest feedback and the time you took to highlight both the positives and the areas where we clearly fell short.

While we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our stunning property, gym facilities, and the buffet spreads at both dinner and breakfast, we are deeply sorry to learn about the service lapses you encountered during your stay.

It is certainly not the experience we strive to offer, and we are especially concerned to hear your feedback regarding the check-in/check-out process, the delay in poolside service, and more importantly, the feeling of being less valued as a local guest. Please accept our sincere apologies for these shortcomings. Every guest at Cinnamon Bentota Beach is important to us, and we are committed to delivering warm, attentive, and timely service to all—without exception.

Your concerns have been shared with the relevant teams, and we are taking immediate steps to ensure better staffing and responsiveness, especially during peak periods. We also take your comment regarding the accessibility of the room seriously, and we will evaluate how we can better accommodate the preferences of our guests when allocating rooms.

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back again in the future, so we can deliver the true Cinnamon experience that you rightfully expected.

They were so unbothered – clearly prioritizing the foreign guests over us locals. It was honestly disappointing. Check-in was slow, and check-out was just as frustrating. What’s worse is that even though we’re paying a hefty amount just like everyone else, the service doesn’t match what we’re being charged for. And when that happens, it really ticks me off.

We were placed in a room at the far end of the property — apparently in the “luxury wing”, but I don’t see how a 5-star hotel can call it luxury when we have to walk ages just to get to the pool or restaurant.

The property itself is beautiful, but the service at the pool was awful. No pool attendants, no waiters in sight, and we had to call the general line to request someone – still no luck. Waited 45 mins for someone to even take our order, and then another hour for the food and drinks to arrive. Their excuse? “We’re too busy.” Not acceptable at all for a hotel of this calibre.

Some saving grace:

	•	The gym was decent.
	•	Pool itself was clean and nice.
	•	Dinner buffet had a solid spread and service was decent.
	•	Breakfast buffet was better in terms of both food and service.

It’s a stunning location, no doubt. But the lack of service, double standards, and poor guest experience really killed the vibe. They need to do better – especially for us locals who choose to spend and support our own hotels.

Примерно за три недели до прилёта предупредили отель, о том что прилетаем, сообщили, что у нас медовый месяц, написали даты, чтобы, как обычно бывает, отель успел подготовиться и все красиво украсить. В ответ кроме презентации экскурсий и расценок в спа нам не сказали ничего.
По прилёту оказалось, что нас никто не ждал, (не смотря на наличие номера бронирования и подтверждения бронирования от отеля) 
Два часа мы просидели на рецепшене, под их разговоры о том, что мест нет и нашего бронирования не существует. Через два часа нас всё-таки поселили, но с условием - мы живем тут только два дня, а дальше перевезут в другой отель на два дня, а потом вернут обратно. (Мы оставили заниматься этой проблемой переселения тур агента, а сами пошли заселяться). Зайдя в номер мы обнаружили, что нам решили подменить номер на обычный, не смотря на то, что мы брали делюкс с видом на океан.(Очевидно, что стоимость у них отличается и само собой никаких украшений в номере не было) Мы вернулись на рецепшн и наши выяснения продолжились, спустя еще час нас переселили в номер с видом на океан, но по прежнему утверждая, что выселят нас через два дня. Спойлер, нас действительно выселили, в качестве извинений мы не получили ничего кроме трансфера в другой отель. 
Когда мы первый раз выселялись из номера, то в чеке на оплату мы увидели спа на 150.000 рупий, который мы не посещали, этот вопрос занял 30 минут, чтобы мы не платили за то, чего у нас не было.
По возвращении в отель во второй раз нас даже не подумали заселить раньше, не смотря на то, что чекаут был в 12, нам пришлось сидеть с чемоданами до 14.
По плану у нас была экскурсия на следующий день в 3 утра и мы попросили на кануне заранее ланч боксы, которые нам, конечно, никто в итоге не приготовил, потому что все забыли и нам дали воду и апельсин с яблоком. 
Когда мы вечером вернулись с экскурсии, то из номера пропала красн��я пижама (мы смотрели и искали во всех углах номера) поэтому позвонили на рецепшн и нам сказали, что на следующий день попробуют что-то сделать, утром нам ее вернули без каких либо извинений или объяснений
На одном из обедов мы нашли в макаронах личинку, но из нас пытались сделать дураков, объясняя все тем, что личинка (мертвая, в масле, на дне тарелки) прилетела к нам с дерева, опять же после этого не было никаких извинений и объяснений.
Под конец отдыха нам опять добавили в счет спа, которого у нас не было на 150.000 рупий, и это опять заняло какое-то время, чтобы доказать, что нам не делали массаж
В самих номерах много плесени в ванной, местами разбитое стекло, присутствует запах затхлости, а так же, если не попросить, то ничего кроме одного полотенца на человека вам не дадут (в нашем номере не было халатов, тапочек и полотенец для рук) Работники ждут чаевые за все, что они делают, в ресторане, если попросишь фильтрованную воду, то они добавляют чек за дополнительный «сервис»
Под конец хочется сказать, что мы не супер искушенные путешественники и у нас нет высокой планки в плане ожиданий от сервиса и ремонта, но это действительно было очень плохо
-не может быть в ланче за 30$ (+ 10%) личинок
-не может рум сервис брать из номера пижаму, когда им захочется 
-нельзя выселять новобрачных в медовый месяц, не предоставляя щедрых извинений 
-не может спа центр выставлять счет за несуществующие процедуры","Невероятной красоты остров и совершенно ужасный отель","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r988651211-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

We are truly sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with the recent meal at Cinnamon Bentota Beach.

However, we do not offer cuttlefish as a main dish in our outlet and that that only serve it as a stand alone dish at some of our outlets. As a competitor restaurant which is close by neighborhood, we find it unfortunate that this was not raised directly to us at the property, to solve the miscommunication on the spot.

Please reach out to me directly to find a solution to this missunderstanding.

Normally, it’s served with fried rice, chili paste, sauce, papadum, and a fresh salad of tomato, onion, and cucumber, making it a complete and satisfying meal.

However, during my visit last Sunday, I had a very disappointing experience. I was served only the cuttlefish, which wasn’t fresh or hot, and the presentation felt rushed and careless. When I inquired why the fried rice and accompaniments were missing, the staff informed me that they were not included, which was completely contrary to my previous visits. After raising this concern, they brought plain rice but still didn’t provide the chili paste, sauce, papadum, or salad, which are essential parts of the dish.

As a loyal customer who has always enjoyed dining here, this experience was truly upsetting and below the standard I expect from a place I admire. I even took pictures to show the stark difference between the usual quality and what I received this time.

I hope the management addresses this issue seriously to ensure consistent quality and service. A gesture like a complimentary dinner would certainly help restore my trust in the restaurant.","Disappointing Experience at My Favorite Restaurant","2024-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r987218057-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

People are nice and helpful.

We cancelled our Taj Booking and moved to Cinnabon because of reviews and wanted to try it.  Property is pretty, refurbished, beach access and river access is also great. Room are spacious and clean. The biggest turn off is staff seems unhappy and unwelcoming.

1. Check in process was slow and with a lot of confusion ( ignored it)
2. Checked in at 9:30 pm, staff suggested we take the buffet, so we went ahead. within 10 mins of sitting down we are asked to speed up by staff saying buffet closes sharp at 10 pm. A asked for a fresh appam at 9:55 and the lady on counter gave me the worst look ever.
3. Next day breakfast we reached at 9:30, again by 9:45 staff asks you to speed up because buffet closes sharp at 10. There isnt enough staff for you to order any stuff sitting down, if given a request to bring a coffee or omellete staff looks disgruntled and order comes atleast 15 min later after multiple reminders
4. Asked service staff for a bathroom cleaning while heading to beach at 11, they said only afternoon staff will do it. Their time is over.
5. Following day dinner,  On the indian counter asked for a roti instead of Naan, one cook agreed to make it, followed by a loud verbal altercation between two staff on why roti request was accepted.
6. While pool was open at 7 pm, pool guy only got towel after multiple requests, since his time was over.

Property is 5 star but service is abysmal for a luxury resort.. In 3 nights we stayed there, never once felt welcomed.

Greeting from Cinnamon Bentota Beach!

Thank you for your feedback, however, it is concerning to see this feedback posted as a negative review given the constant communication directly and service recovery offered during and post stay. We would like to reiterate that that the feedback is unduly exaggerated to portray the property negatively and it is concerning that after enjoying the luxury and comfort of the suite provided with personalized service and an invitation for a complementary stay without a time restriction post check out, negative reviews have been posted on multiple platforms purely due to the lack of financial return and we look forward to welcoming you back for another exceptional stay in the future.

Upon our arrival, and following a full day of travel (c.7 hour drive), we had hoped to relax in the room / poolside for an hour before dinner. Unfortunately, having arrived at 5pm, the check-in process took an hour and we arrived at our room around 6pm. Already frustrated, we were met with great disappointment with our ‘luxury seafront / sea view room’ - at this point it’s worth quoting how the room is described on your official website / booking page “Our Luxury Sea View King Room delights you with terrific views and elegant interiors. Delve in an elevated private terrace with a view of the stretching Indian Ocean”.

Please attached image to see the reality of said view.

Given this disappointment, I informed the front desk that I would like an explanation, to which they replied that ‘we do not own the trees and therefore cannot cut them down, not allowing a sea view’. I wasn’t happy with this excuse and requested a new room with an improved view. 

We were then shown 2 new rooms, the 2nd of which I agreed to take - it’s worth noting while slightly improved, there was still no view of the ocean, however, by this point my partner and I were so exhausted that I could not muster the energy to look for any better. We kindly asked for our bags to be transferred to this new room, so we could freshen up and change clothes before going for dinner (already sad we would now not have time for a swim before sunset).

The bags took around 1 and a half hours to arrive, meaning we were not able to get ready until 8pm, essentially feeling held captive in our room while we waited! It would have been appreciated for reception to offer us refreshments while we waited, however, were told bluntly that we could ‘call room service’ - which we had to do multiple times given the ever-extending time it took to be reunited with our possessions (including laptops and chargers etc.).

We eventually were able to attend the buffet at around d 8:30pm (much later than we had wanted) having finally changed clothes etc. The food was poor and overpriced. When we arrived back at our room, feeling exhausted and stressed out by the check-in ordeal, my partner and I had wanted nothing more than to relax in a cold room, and watch some TV. Unfortunately, this is where the real issues began.

The first issue was the fan was not working above the bed. The air con was also not working efficiently and was not reducing the temperature below 25 degrees + (too hot for comfort). The next issue was the TV was not working. I informed reception, who sent an engineer to fix these

Issues as it was going to be a very uncomfortable night's sleep. He arrived at almost midnight, and spent 15 minutes attempting to fix each problem - none of which were corrected.

About 5 minutes after he left, I heard something fall from ceiling. I inspected the chest of drawers next to the TV to find a very large cockroach scuttling around the table top, and also on the food & cake we had in our room. Needless to say, we would not be eating these. My partner was also hysterical and refused to sleep in a room potentially infested and likely unsanitary.

This was the final straw after a quite frankly shambolic first night at your hotel. I immediately informed reception of the problem and requested a visit from the night manager. He then moved us to room 3306 - coral suite. We got into this room just before 1am, exhausted and fed up. I’m sure you have now seen the image of the cockroach as the night manager took a photo also, but I have attached here again for reference along with multiple images documenting the awful first night experience. I also have an extended video showing the cockroach moving around the room. 

This final room change of the night was appreciated and the coral suite was adequate for the remainder of our stay - but also not without its faults (strange high-pitched noise, faulty taps etc.).

A couple of days later, the night manager approached us while we were having a drink in the long bar to ask how our stay was progressing. I informed him that while the room change has been appreciated, the overall sentiment from us was disappointment. Essentially, it felt as though a full night of our holiday had been stolen from us, and a full night's rest - which was greatly needed after long travels - was also denied (meaning the enjoyment of subsequent days was reduced through tiredness). He didn’t seem to understand this and was defensive about the situation.

I also want to note that for the majority of our stay, we were made to like 2nd class citizens vs. guests in big parties including a Russian chemical company and an Indian wedding which essentially took over both the hotel’s facilities, and the beach (making it a building site on two occasions while stages were erected and dismantled). The persistent hammering late into the night to create the rather garish 'Hollywood sign' by the swimming pool (directly below our room) on our final sleep was also frustrating. 

Overall, while the upgrade at the time was appreciated, it didn't paper over any cracks and the stay was poor - they have subsequently offered another night free in on of their Sri Lankan hotels, however, being based in the UK, I don't see us taking up that offer any time soon.

Unfortunately, the General Manager, Johan Aschan, has also chosen to ignore our messages about this bad experience.","Cockroaches, Faulty Aircon & Fan, Poor Service From Management - Avoid","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r945965280-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

The original building is beautiful and unique. Unfortunately, it has been ruined with very poorly designed and constructed extensions exasperated by poor maintenance ( see pictures)
The hotel is also situated on a railway line! 
The staff, particularly reception , do not appear to have any pride in the hotel. There is no information available regarding the building or the services, not even a map of the grounds which are quite extensive. There is a small art gallery which is not publicised and ,when you go to look, there is no information about any of the pictures, not even a small plaque giving title and name of painter.
Rooms
Despite being aware that my husband was disabled, we were initially allocated a room far away from restaurant and all other hotel facilities.We had paid extra for a beach accessible room. We were informed that the hotel was full.After a very tiring and traumatic experience, we finally agreed on a ground floor room which was far from ideal. There was mould in toilet and shower room and both indoor and outdoor sofas were stained. The room looked generally neglected. After 2 days ,we were moved to a junior suite in main building. The room was excellent,totally different from those in the extensions. We were closer to railway line and “hooting” trains but learnt to live with this, triple glazing would have helped with the sleeping! 
Food
We enjoyed excellent food throughout our stay. Breakfast buffet was chaotic when hotel was full of weekenders. Evening buffet had an amazing choice of food, mainly good. The a la carte restaurant was superb. There is an open kitchen ,staff are friendly and helpful with allergies. All the food we had there was delicious and good value.","A very mixed experience.","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r937418870-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Prov.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. We understand how important your holiday plans were, and we deeply regret that we were unable to meet your expectations.

As mentioned, the issue was related to a sewage problem that required immediate attention, and unfortunately, the rooms were temporarily uninhabitable due to the smell. Our front office manager personally reached out to you to explain the situation and inform you of the issue. We understand how frustrating this must have been, especially so close to your travel dates.

While we did offer a refund, we recognize the disruption this caused, particularly during the peak season, and we genuinely regret that it impacted your holiday plans. We have taken your feedback seriously and are reviewing our processes to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

 10 days prior to departure, the manager called to cancel our booking, He said it was due to a sewage problem and that the rooms were smelly. They said they will not be able to repair it in the coming week, which I found very odd and highly unlikely.

Oddly enough the hotel remained open, and when I called the reception later, was told that they were fully booked till mid-Jan. Don't know how this was possible. 

They did refund our money,  ruined the Christmas holiday for 4 families. It was near impossible to find another hotel so close to the date, being peak tourist season. 

Pretty sure it was a lie, and they gave the rooms at a higher rate to someone else, which apparently has happened before from what I've heard

Its Staff also (Except senior front office Management & Hotel Management) very friendly & giving their utmost service within capacity of their area. 

I was there earlier 05 nights in two times with good and very unfortunate situation.

1st time I was spends 02 nights with my office staff and It is nice get-together.

2nd time I went there with my family and one of my best friend’s family for 02 days (Total 09 pax). There was mountain bicycle in front of hotel and I noted that our children play with the bicycle in checking time. Then we came for a lunch. Meantime our kids play with bicycle once again after having lunch at car park under our super vision. (The day car park was free as hotel is having only our group)  

Unfortunately, my little daughter met with an accident in front of the hotel area. There was a big slop without any boundary wall or fence.  She was fallen to 6-8 feet deep unsecured deadly water drainage with bicycle. I have to thank to Gods to save her life

Immediately we took her to a hospital with unconsciousness situation. Fortunately, my wife is a nursing officer and she was given big effort to regain consciousness situation as that area very rural and we spent more than 2 hours to transfer to Peradeniya hospital.

I would like to give my thanks to all doctors, nursing staff, ambulance driver and other staff at hospital, because all of them give full effect to recover her life. They have done over o1 hour surgery & admit during 03 days. Now she is fine with scars around the face.   

I mentioned the above story, as hotel management don’t take any responsibility for this incident. They were ignored us every time when we try to meet them to discuss the issue, stating that they are busy with meetings. We had to stay even the discharging day of our child at the same hotel. However, they were fully charged for 03 days and gave only Rs. 3000.00 discount even though we paid per night Rs. 50,000/-.

I want to inform you that When you decide to select this hotel, you should go there alone without child and you have to take your own risk. They never consider guest safety in the hotel premises. You must give full attention to following.

1.	When you take the bicycle they never give any advice or notice. 
Due to this incident, I requested them to remove the bicycle for kids in front of hotel and issue them with advice regarding the sloppy area and advise parent also. Unfortunately, I saw the repaired Bikes in the same place when we leave the premises. 

2.	There is very dangerous end of the pool, there are over 30 feet hell and especially baby pool area also deadly hell. No any boundary wall, fence or safety tactics. 

3.	There are Durian trees (Scientific name: Durio) side on the road. Near pool area and bungalow. when ripe fruits falling, it caused to very serious injury If it fallen to someone head. Not any Cover or safety precautions’. 

This incident was happened on 19-08-2018, Until today (10-10-2018) hotel management or any representative never apologies or ask the situation of my suffering kid.   

I never willing to go there in my life time and not to recommend anybody, as the hotel don’t have any experience how to manage errors or mistake directly affected Human Life, and do the best Management to collect the Money by over promising.","Ignorance of guest care.","2018-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4297383-d14986007-r623677687-Simpson_s_Forest_Luxury_Boutique_Resort_Spa-Wattegama_Kandy_District_Central_P.html",

We have had a 4.8/ 5 review ratings out of 623 reviews on TripAdvisor,  9.4/10 in bookings.com 4.4/5 on google and 9.8 on Hotel.com...... We are perplexed at your anger because what is omitted in your review is you booked an entry level room for your honeymoon and we feeling empathic of your situation offered you a complimentary Suite upgrade as it was your honeymoon. The confusion is that you were also comparing a much more secluded boutique luxury experience to what the Anantara and Mariott Weligama offers which is around 200 rooms with buffets and a much different & active experience. our offering is clear on the website for what it is which is why guests choose this more intimate setting over the other two hotels you mentioned which are different experiences. We purposefully do not have buffets but an a la carte menu. We are secluded and not part of a larger town scene.  you also omitted to say I met you as I was at the Villa the night you came to get your luggage . and spoke with you in detail but clearly you had made your mind up. regardless of our efforts to help and also point out we are not a large mass hotel nor do we purport to be. I also have no disparaging comments to make of these hotels nor should I. Your review is your point of view which you have a right to but I feel has a lot of unproductive commentary. The third party you booked through never agreed to a refund if that was the case you would have received it.... Complaining about leaves falling I guess is expected where your surrounds are not all concrete but also in further evidence our place or similar with trees outside were not of your liking.. We tried to do our best immediately to upgrade you for free to a suite . It seems nothing we would have done would have matched your need to go to a much larger hotel under any circumstance. We do  not want to nor do we compete with this. Clearly your review of 1/5 is yours but 100's of others disagree. Should you have accepted the suite we offered you free of charge perhaps you may have enjoyed a different discerning experience. You chose not to, which was, your choice.. We wish you and your wife all the best going forward and encourage you to book in those larger type properties which you prefer up front from the beginning. Their style of Hotel is great and all places have a choice of offerings for guests.

IT IS A GUESTHOUSE NOT 5* HOTEL. IT HAS NO STAR RATING!
HOMEYMOON RUINED!!!!
We booked online from the UK for our honeymoon as all booking websites stated this was a 5* hotel. We picked it due to this and it was the most expensive hotel in the area (even more than the Marriott Weligama/ we had just arrived from Anatara resort) and our longest stay. On arrival we were so underwhelmed. The property grounds were not tidy with leaves everywhere, the bathroom was run down with no amenities like a vanity or dental kit, the towels were not hotel and poor quality.
The bar staff hassled us to buy drinks as we walked around. No 5* service. Breakfast was poor.
We raised our concerns with the manager in the first instance and enquired about checking out early as we were on our honeymoon and had paid a lot for 5* and this was clearly not the case. The manager agreed to upgrade the room but we decided to sleep on it and decide in the morning.
I then woke up with dead mosquitos on my pillow (first time in all of our Sri lanka 3 week stay) despite the mosquito net. Breakfast was poor quality with no fresh fruit and options of cappuccino at an extra charge! This is not 5*..
They had no complimentary activities like yoga, you also cannot surf on the beach!
We immediately expressed checking out early due to disappointment and getting a refund for the remaining nights. The manager Kenny then stated we booked through a third party so we needed to contact them to check but had we booked directly with the hotel he would have refunded us. So we proceeded to do this.
The third party agreed for a refund based on this ( we have it in writing) and said that they had made contact with the hotel and that they had agreed for a refund for us.
We then proceeded to book an alternative hotel (as we had confirmation we booked the Marriot).
We proceeded to get our bags and tell Kenny this, however he disputed the refund saying he had not stated this to us or third party and that he will not refund us. He called the higher manager who suggested our experience was due to booking an inferior room and 5* is subjective so we would not be refunded.
It was sad and upsetting and has ruined our honeymoon. Upon checking into the Marriot, they advised us the property had no star rating we then emailed the official Sri Lankan tourism board who said the same (photos attached).

We are very sorry with your experience and a bit puzzled that you feel our pictures are deceiving. We have full beach views and do serve meals at our beach hut. We have put up a cinnamon fence beachside which we didn't have before but this is due to restrictions with Covid, and duty of care of our guests which is our #1 priority.  However, this hasn't altered our location which is beachside. Unfortunately Tripadvisor doesn't seem to have the ability to add photos that I can add to this reply but I have taken the liberty to post some photos on Instagram and Facebook taken at 5pm today through to sunset to see the views and also including the cinnamon fence and seating beachside for meals. 
 We can get the beach at different levels during different seasons due to weather patterns which is beyond our control. It is possible you experienced this a few days back of which I am sorry to hear. We do appreciate your candid feedback and we are adding a ladder for those days that there might be a drop in the beach. 
In regards to the the charge for Sausages and Bacon these are automatically included in the BB rate in the Western breakfast option with Eggs, Juice and fruit. However if there is an extra order above and beyond we do charge as we pride ourselves on made to order A la Carte menu options and no Buffets.
We are sorry that you too did not feel treated as a VIP as we would like to treat all our guests as VIP's. We appreciate your feedback and are sorry you feel there was any form of misrepresentation.

The pictures they have used are very deceiving. There’s no access to the beach from the hotel and there are meals on the beach as shown in the pics. Whiles the junior staff is very helpful and provide a great service the management is completely the opposite. 
If you are looking for a place with a beautiful beach front this is not the place.  Although the rooms are nice, the money you pay here is wasted. There are so many other places you can get for half the price. Here you will be charged for even sausages or bacon at breakfast even if you go on BB basis. I would not visit this place ever again and will not recommend it for anyone either. Just an expensive place with false advertising. 
Don’t be fooled by the pics of the beach. There is nothing like that. 
Also if you are unlucky enough (as we were) to be there at a time a so called VIP is residing, the manager will treat you as if you are staying there without paying and will even ask you not to swim on to one side of the pool just so that you don’t disturb the “VIP”.

I stayed at this property in 2017 and liked it and promised to return.  I booked for a total of 9 nights for July 2018 and paid about 3 weeks before my intended stay, but unfortunately had to cancel about 10 days before arriving because of unexpected hospitalisation and 2 subsequent operations.

I sent Marcy my hospitalisation certificate and she told me to cancel the bookings on booking.com and said that she would look into a refund in the circumstances.  I followed up my email a few times and received this response:

“Oh my goodness.  My sincere apologies for the breakdown in communication.   I will review all of this once I am at the office and respond to you
>
> Best regards
> Marcy”

That review never happened.  I called one day and Marcy said she was only thinking of me that morning and would look into it and come back to me.  I didn’t hear anything and so I called and Marcy told me that the internet had been down for 3 days and she was still catching up.  I believed her.

As no response was received, I called again and spoke to Marcy - she told me a full refund for the 9 nights was being “processed” and that I’d receive an email.  I believed her - again.  A week passed and no email or refund had been received, so I called Marcy again - this time her story was there had been a 2 day holiday and banks had been closed, so all payments had been delayed and again it was a full refund.  Marcy told me to call her again if the refund wasn’t received.

Well, as you’ve probably guessed the refund wasn’t received and Marcy never accepted any call from me nor did she even have the courtesy too return my email or voicemail requests. 

This is so disappointing - not only not receiving any refund at all (when I checked and saw the rooms had been rebooked), but the continual lies and lack of respect to a returning customer - the spin of lies over 2 months speaks volumes.  I would prefer to stay with, and give my patronage, to people who are honest and treat me with respect. On a side note our ‘non refundable’ air tickets and accommodation at another property were refunded without any issue.

Sadly, Sri Shavari, fell down very badly here, despite me giving them every opportunity to explain, but instead a succession of lies.

It was with dismay that I read your review, which followed the review of Chloe whom was also a part of your group of 4.   I have already responded to Chloe’s review and my  response to yours  is as follows.
Your group booked 2 Terrace Rooms via two separate online booking agents.  The description of the Terrace Rooms on the online site you booked provided the below description:
Room size: 20 m²
Bed: 1 large double bed
Located on the second floor in the Spa building, this room has a maximum occupancy of 2 persons including infants and children. The guests can choose to dine at the room's private balcony or on the front lawn's beach side deck.
Room facilities: Balcony,Patio, Garden view, Terrace,Satellite Channels, Flat-screen TV, Safety Deposit Box, Air Conditioning, Iron, Seating Area, Fan, Mosquito net, Wardrobe/Closet, Clothes rack, Shower, Hairdryer, Free toiletries, Toilet, Bathroom, Dining area, Dining table, Outdoor furniture, Outdoor dining area, Wake-up service, Alarm clock, Towels, Linen, Upper floors accessible by stairs only
Free WiFi is available in all rooms.

Upon check in I did take you aside as I noticed that your group of 4 had oversized luggage plus hand luggage.  I showed you the rooms that you had booked.  You indicated that you thought that you had booked the Villa rooms based on the photograph of the Villa on the website.  I advised  that you had booked the 2 Terrace Rooms which are the entry level rooms.  They are clearly identified as such on the online booking website – they are our smallest  rooms; are located in our Spa building and are available at the lowest rate.  The photos of theTerrace Rooms on the online booking websites do not in any way misrepresent the room, its size or its location, which I indicated to you when I said there are not any photos of the Terrace Rooms that are similar to the Villa Suite photos.  When booking online there are 4 Rooms/Suites to choose from and you chose the entry level Terrace Rooms rather than one of the 3 other Suite rooms available in the Villa.  All 4 Rooms/Suites are clearly identified with their own photos and descriptors on all online booking websites.

Wishing to make your stay here as pleasant and comfortable as possible I did offer you and your husband an upgrade.  I even offered it on a complimentary basis.  I did this of my own initiative.  I showed you the Ocean Suite room and you accepted the upgrade.  Unfortunately I did not have another higher category room to upgrade your son and his partner to on a complimentary basis, despite your strong suggestion that I should do so.  The price difference between the Terrace Room and the Ocean Suite is USD 190 per night, but I did not request any extra payment from you.  You pressed the issue about upgrading your son to a Beach Suite.  I advised that we did not have another Villa Suite continuously available for the length of your stay for your son and further that I was not in a position to offer a 2nd complimentary upgrade.  At no point did you advise me that your son was recovering from surgery and it was certainly not apparent to me, as he wore no shoulder sling.  I did say that your son and his partner would be fine in the room that they booked and paid for.  The Terrace Room is a very popular room and enjoys regular and frequent occupancy from a variety of other guests, without complaint.

Regarding your criticisms of the complimentary upgraded Suite, the living space in the villa is a common shared space, which is also clearly identified and set out in the online booking engine’s website.  I explained that to you before you accepted the complimentary upgrade.  Similarly, it is also explained online that meals are served in the villa’s dining space, on the villa’s terrace, in room, or on the main pool deck.  We have a full kitchen with Chef and Sous Chef.  We have complimentary wifi throughout the property and I apologize that the wifi password  was not  available in your upgraded Suite.  Once you brought it to my attention you were immediately given the password.  The password was available in your son’s room as I reviewed it with him and his partner.  

Your family chose to go out for dinner and when you returned you advised me that this place was not for you and that you would be checking out in the morning.  

Your complaint about the beach perplexes me as our property is located right on the beach and it is completely accessible.  Similarly I am confused by  the complaint about your husband’s breathing machine.  Your Suite has many power plugs, including two power plugs on either side of the bed, as there are bedside lamps.  There was no need for your husband to sleep on the Suite’s couch.  There is a fridge located in each villa’s pantry. 

While the power did go off twice during the night, we have a generator that kicked in right away ensuring that electricity flowed all night, including lighting, air conditioning and overhead fans.  Unfortunately the hot water switch to your son’s room had been accidentally turned off, but once we were notified of the situation it was  rectified.  A dog did playfully try to catch your son’s partner’s dress and I immediately removed the dog from the property and apologized. 

We have been in operation for almost 2 years and the overwhelming experience of our other guests has been a very positive one, with high marks given for our service, our amenities, our staff and our meals.  Guests genuinely enjoy the fact that we are located outside of Mirissa, so they can enjoy the peace and quiet our beach offers, but also in less than 10 minutes be amongst the hustle and bustle of Mirissa Beach.  We have many guests whom have enjoyed long stays here.  

I do agree with you that it is always advisable to know which room you are choosing before you book, as complimentary upgrades are not always available when you realize that you have mistakenly booked a room you did not intend to.  Taking the time to read the online description of the room and to view that particular room’s photos is a good way to educate yourself on the room you are booking .

The matter was resolved as per your request to have the remainder of your 5 night booking cancelled without  a cancellation penalty to yourself or to your son and his partner.

We interpreted to be a spacious villa, beautiful decorated with an amazing pool located in Mirissa right on the beach.
What a way to spend 5 nights /6 beautiful days with our family and help our son heal after a traumatic injury at work in which has caused some trauma and distress.

We get there after a 5 hour car ride and all exhausted, thirsty, tired and hungry!
We are greeted, our driver had to find a local accommodation which we had been informed by an email, I was shown to the rooms just after we were told we had too much luggage (2 large and 2 small suitcases) just came from Italy! I was offered a larger room option one with sea view which was not really recommended as sea is quite rough and strong wave sounds and no privacy, so we picked the other one which was recommended by Marcy (Canadian Manager) and she also said that my son should be ok with the terrace room. 
He got a room with no phone and two mattress joined together. My son had just had a shoulder surgery!!! 

We could have had him upgraded at an additional $190US per night! The vibes were not right so we chose not to go with that option plus we had already paid almost AUD$300 per night for 5nights x 2.

I did mention to Marcy that was not what I had visioned, I did expect the Terrace Rooms to be what they were, her reply was ""we don't even have images of the Terrace Room""!

The living spaces images shown are of common living areas unless you book the whole villa which is over $1100 per night I think! 

There was no restaurant and asked for a menu for room service about 3 people came to the door, all I could recall that stood out on the menu was Fish and chips or something similar, while we are still trying to settle, mind you my son's room had no Phone so you need to go downstairs for room service, we had no telly in our room and could not get access to WiFi at that point.

It was quite late so we called our driver and we had dinner somewhere local.  When we got back all we could think of was, how the hell are we going to cope for the rest of our stay? No fridge in our room, my husband could not plug his breathing machine (for sleep apnoea) so he slept on the couch! The power went off 8 times, and my son's partner was stuck under a cold shower in the dark!  Again no one to call and no instruction as what to do in the event that happened, as this is very common at these premises according other staff members, Not to mention one of the dogs tried to nip my son's partner.

Breakfast was included but we refused to even have a coffee and left as soon as we could get our driver to pick us up and takes us to Hikkaduwa, booking which we had made near midnight the night before in the presence of the Operation Manager who was very sympathetic and understanding of our circumstances. 

When we got to Hikkaduwa we received great hospitality, 2 TVs in each room plus a phone in 3 locations, I almost cried (we only needed one of each while on holiday) and the standard essentials.

Make sure you know what room you are booking and it is not a 5star place.  To my understanding for a place to be 5star it needs to have a restaurant, TV, Phone, idiot proof instructions, tea and coffee facilities, fridge etc in which this place not have in every room. 

These Villas / rooms are approximately 12mths old so the furniture is fairly new and pool looked nice. Not that we got to use it! 
This place suits a person that likes to be isolated, happy to just sit by the pool, no need for a TV or phone, and expect for the power to go off several times a day. You will know what I mean once you are there!","It looked too good to be true!

At Sri Sharavi we aim to provide each guest with an impeccably relaxing experience and we are most disappointed that our efforts were not satisfactory for you.  Our villas are individually staffed with a house butler who is on duty to care for our guests, while at the same time provide them with privacy.  We will certainly discuss with our staff how to better balance their level of service.  We are happy that you enjoyed the layout of the villas and we certainly hope that you took advantage of having exclusive use of the villa living/dining space and private terrace, while you dined. The pantry you mention in your review is there for the house butler to service the guests and also for the guests' convenience should they wish to keep snacks and not meant for cooking.  Our menu is focused  on Sri Lankan dishes, seafood and fish, along with western food choices.  Our Chef does his best to accommodate guests' requests, but unfortunately some Indian menu requests are not available.","1536","158617423","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/74/4f/4f/photo1jpg.jpg","2048","2048","158617422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/74/4f/4e/photo0jpg.jpg","1536",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Road 153 Km Post, Kamburugamuwa, Matara 81750 Sri Lanka","Kamburugamuwa","Sri Lanka","81750",,"Matara Road","153 Km Post","6958701","5.938807","Kamburugamuwa, Matara, Southern Province","80.48735","Sri Sharavi Beach Villas & Spa","625","4.8","4","3","12","53","553","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4481519-d6958701-Reviews-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html","http://www.srisharavibeachvillas.com","2015-11-07","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Going by the high ratings, we had opted for this place. Undoubtably the location right touching the sea, a large long swimming pool make this seem like a beautiful place for a holiday but the facilities are poor.firstly we were misled by term  garden facing room. This was nothing but two plants on side of room and with a tall wall behind. Then there was no phone in room so one has to go search for their meagre staff for anything you need. The free wi fo was another disappointment as it almost never seemed available. The place had a pantry where food could be cooked if desired but who would do that on a holiday? The absence of a restaurant but a cook in house with very limited food options and that too at very high price, made us search for food options outside.
This place is liked by those foreigners who just wish to relax.","Nice layout, sea view but unsatisfactory facilities ","2015-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d6958701-r325150254-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",
