I was disappointed because we were taken on a tea plantation tour (a small plantation owned by the venue) and told that the tea pickers get paid the equivalent of £2.50 a day to pick 20 kg of tea leaves). There was only around 5 or 6 tea pickers so a very small operation. This is probably the norm in Sri Lanka however when the owner feels comfortable to charge $160 a night, $4.50 a beer (more than anywhere else I went to in Sri Lanka) and  $15 a head for an incredibly average and basic afternoon tea - I'd hope he could do a little more to subsidise his staff. There are photos of the owners family all over the place however they can't even subsidise their staff. It's really sad to see, especially as the owners live locally. If the place wasn't plastered with photos of the owning family, giving it a caring and pleasant family vibe (and not a corporate chain) - I guess this may not have bothered me as much as it did. As this happens everywhere, sadly.  But as a small business, he can help these halndful of staff and chooses not to. However, he can charge an extortionate $4.5 for a can of Sri Lankan non inported beer. Not a place where I'd spend my money again.","Bad vibes","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r836476364-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

Thanks so much for your comments - great to get a New Year's call to action!

It does seem you rather missed the mood at Ashburnham and it was a mistake for you - or your travel agent - to line it up for you. I'm sorry for that. 

Your disappointment at not having a minibar in the room probably speaks best of the mismatch! The same goes for phones I'm afraid. If people want minibars and room service, Ashburnham certainly isn't a good fit. 

I'm a but muddled at your implication that a stream of other criticisms have been ignored. No alcohol license I'm afraid isn't so much a problem as a fact of life. And of course the vast majority of comments here are very positive. 

I'd also suggest that 3 dinner options - changing every day - is a pretty good range for a 6 bedroom tea estate hotel a long way from a supermarket. 

Will take heed of your comments re. slow service. That's unusual and will be addressed.

All the best,

The location and surroundings were beautiful but the facilities of the hotel are average at best. I wish I had read the reviews before going:  

Service 
- Staff were always a bit of a challenge to find - we often had to go into their kitchen to get their attention for service (there are no phones in the room) no phones are fine if staff are then attentive which was not the case.
- we had to wait 30 minutes for someone to bring us our final bill and repeatedly had to ask if someone was coming to serve us 

Room/ facilities 
- decor is nice but we stayed in the smaller room which as other guests have stated has no air conditioning- only a single plug in fan. The room was stuffy and smelt damp. The bathroom was also damp. There’s no mini bar or any facilities that makes you feel like the price is worth it. 

Food/ alcohol 
- again as other comments have shown they do not have an alcohol licence. It’s possible to get drinks but mostly just a concern that some of those comments were written a while back and yet this has still not been solved.
- food is overpriced. In our welcome book it stated that a 3 course meal is $20 but on the menu board it was $25. There’s limited food options of 3 choices Sri Lankan curry and 2 western options. Being so far from anything you don’t really have a choice but to eat there and it’s def not the $25 they are asking for

All their prices were in $ which also is off putting no other hotel we stayed at in Sri Lanka had that and they were far superior in service, standards and facilities.

The surroundings are beautiful and is ultimately what saved it for us. But I would bother they clearly haven’t taken on board other comments from their customers and it shows. Disappointing and I would avoid- am sure there are other places offering a similar experience where the overall standard of the hotel would match the price.","Lacking","2020-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r741249121-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

Tempting, of course, to address each and all of them but I don't suspect doing so here would make you feel much better so shan't.

A great shame you didn't enjoy time at Ash, as many have in the past. I'm sorry for that. 

It does seem there were some (relatively) exceptional circumstances - drought/continual power cuts - but as said, little point fighting the corner in light of such spirited attack.

The house should be very charming, but it’s in a bit of a time warp.  It’s in serious need of investment and TLC.  Our room was small and unbearable hot and stuffy during the night - not only was there no air-conditioning, it didn’t even have a ceiling fan.  We noted some of the rooms had rotating fans, but not ours.  The paint was peeling on one wall, which was unsightly.  The internet was hopeless and the electricity was off for much of the day, without any warning or explanation.  The pool was full of leaves and somewhat murky water - the filter obviously wasn’t working properly (possibly because of no electricity).  The food was OK, but the choice was very limited (2 starters and 3 mains).  A young British couple were the ‘managers'; , very pleasant but complete amateurs when it comes to hotel management!  The tour of the tea plantation was interesting and the tea tasting was fun - thank you Mr Das.","Fabulous location, but in need of serious TLC","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r663997709-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

As a traveller with corporate and a professional background, I post with experience and authority on 5* hotel properties.

So, where does one begin?

When booking a vacation, we don't use 3rd party agents, Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Expedia, etc., etc., we book directly with the hotel property.

We booked and paid in full for this property during April 2024, for a 3 week stay during January 2025.

5 days, prior to departure from the UK, I emailed the property confirming my booking, and advising our expected arrival time due to overnight flight (we included and paid for an additional night)

Despite requesting an acknowledgement to my email, the hotel failed to reply with a courteous or acknowledge my email.

On arrival at the property, the hotel had no confirmation for my booking!!

We we're offered ""complementary"" breakfast whilst this was looked into (we paid in advance for breakfast, given we'd paid for an extra night's accommodation.

Eventually, I had to produce the invoice I paid in April 2024, it turns out, I paid a company call ""United Hotels"" this is the parent company of EKHO SURF Bentota.

Once my invoice was confirmed, via the hotel contacting ""United Hotels"" we were taken to our room.

The room offered 244 was NOT the room we had booked and paid for.

Back to reception, explaining that the room offered was not what we had booked as per our invoice, eventually, we were offered a ""complementary"" upgrade, so, now we have 2 ""complementary"" offers, given both issues we'd already paid for.

Now we are offered the room we booked and paid for, room 218, after dinner and a long flight, we retired to bed early.

Early rise, preparation for breakfast, it's was clear the room was not the standard one was expecting, I'll give a detailed response below.

Once in the restaurant for breakfast, it became evident very soon, the restaurant was lacking professionalism and attention to detail.

Breakfast is an open buffet, food was cold, numerous items were not replenished, bred toaster, one would wait over 10 tuning several time just to achieve 2 pieces of toast, the bread toaster was old and well out of use.

Breakfast plates were left on our table to pile up, despite numerous restaurant employees walking past, not one employee collected our used dishes, on questioning, I was informed, it's another employee's zone!!

Following breakfast, returning to our room, it was clear, this property has serious issues concerning cleanliness, the room was full off dust, had numerous chips in the walls, certain plug sockets didn't work.

We went out for the day, expecting the room attendant to give the room an overall.

On returning, it was clear, apart from the beds being made, and room towel change, nothing, nothing had been done to improve hygiene in the room.

Having now complained to reception about the room standard, the hotel manager came to our room.

I clearly pointed out the hygiene standards, the original issues when trying to check in, the error with initial room availability, due to the room standard, the hotel manager offered ""complementary"" evening buffet, whilst he and his team revamped the room!!

2hrs were spent with numerous employees trying to bring the rook up to a 5* standard.

During our ""complementary"" evening buffet, we witnessed a carbon copy of the previous morning issues, food cold, food not replenished, plates left to pile up on our table.

We'd almost reached breaking point.

The following morning day 3, during buffet breakfast, I requested fresh orange juice, I was informed, fresh orange juice is not available to guests, I then spoke to the restaurant manager, again, requested fresh orange juice, I was informed, fresh orange juice is not available, however, as a replacement, orange cordial, pineapple juice, or tropical fruit juice was available.

We departed the hotel, and visited a number of 5* hotels in the area seeking room availability for our stay, we've stayed at these properties previously, Taj, Cinnamon, Centara Ceysands resort.

Given we required immediate availability, Centara Ceysands resort was the property  that assisted, we checked in for the remining 15nights we had in Bentota.

We returned back to EKHO SURF, informed reception we were checking out.

The hotel manager visited our room again, and requested what could he do to improve our stay, unfortunately nothing, 

I made it clear to the hotel manager, and will say here, the lack of hygiene, lack of respect for guests, lack of training, lack of accountability all stop at the door of the hotel manager.

Overall impression, all employees wear the same uniform, so it's difficult to identify who belongs to which department.

No employee has a named staff badge on show, not one, so, if one was to compliment or complain about an employee, virtually impossible without an employee name.

The hotel manager is fully ware who I am, having integrated with him during my limited time in the property.

In conclusion, this is a run down property, lacking in basic hygiene, professionalism, catering for ""package"" holiday's, and in my opinion, deserves the 2* rating I've awarded it.

Neither the hotel or company brand deserve your custom, given numerous 5* properties are within walking distance of EKHO SURF, Taj, Thaala, Cinnamon. 

As in most replies when one complains about a hotel property, a spokesperson usually replies ""on behalf"" of the manager, with an attempt to play down the issues raised in a review, rest assured, I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I speak with authority, professionalism, and experience, which is what my observation of EKHO SURF Bentota is based on.

You have the choice whether the EKHO SURF Hotel deserves you custom, or a more valued property close by is more deserving, each one, offering and maintaining a true 5* experience, something the EKHO SURF has a long way to go in an attempt to compete.","2 stars for a 2 star property.","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r990261624-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking time to post your feedback on behalf of your client. 

It is true that one of other guest (under the influence of alcohol) had come out and urinated to the open area of your client's room in the late night (outside terrace).

However the guest had already finished the job by the time security entered to the scene and security had taken him back apologizing your client and immediately informed the duty manager.

 Rhe duty manager immediately apologized from your client even though it was done by another guest (as he was under the influence of alcohol).

They had washed the entire area with detergent and haven't stopped there. Duty Manager offered a room change as well.
I believe this is the best that we could do at that time. We are not in a position to take legal actions against such behavior of a guest (as your client says).

But we did every possible effort you make your client feel better even though this was not done by one of our hotel staff.

Unfortunately your client was keep on shouting at the lobby this morning saying ""I want this to be heard by every possible one of your guests"". I still do not understand why he wanted it to be heard by the world.
With great difficulty I somehow managed to tale him to the lounge area and tried to make him understand that this was out of our control, please accept our apologies on behalf of the other guest.

Yet he was arrogantly said ""I will post this in every social media"" and then he called you up and gave me the phone.

You were fine at the at the beginning but very rude to me then using ""F"" language. As a reputed Travel Agent you should have never used such abusive language. I had to stop our conversation as I could not bare your language anymore.

I very clearly and confidently state that your client was never abused or harassed, instead we got harassed for something we never committed. And it was a very disappointing discussion and a situation.

However thank you for your feedback and our sincere apology for any inconvenience even though it was not done from the hotel.

Thank you.

Her reply was sorry we are fully booked, despite me requesting for a top floor balcony room when i made the reservation itself. 

I was so tired and angry - my husband had to block the door with a coffee table and our stroller so my Son wont fall into the pool.

We checked in at 1 PM, only to be disappointed right from the start. No welcome drinks, and the room wasn’t ready until 2 PM. We were asked to have lunch while waiting, but the restaurant shockingly had almost no vegetarian options—just two varieties of rice, a noodle, and a curry. We were then directed to another restaurant for better options, implying we should leave our son in the first restaurant as he had already started eating the buffet. Absolutely unacceptable!

After multiple requests, we were handed the cafe menu, only to find that half the items weren’t available. With the hotel at full occupancy, this seems like either gross mismanagement or a blatant attempt to push guests towards the overpriced buffet. 

The lunch we finally received was a disaster. The so-called Spaghetti Stroganoff turned out to be cold, flavorless tomato concasse tossed spaghetti. Definitely not Stroganoff in any way! We ate it quietly because, frankly, we were too exhausted to complain anymore.

Adding to the frustration, the extra bed we had prepaid for while booking through Make My Trip two months ago took a shocking 7 hours and countless reminders to be placed in our room. 

While the room itself was decent, there was no room service menu card, and trying to reach reception was a nightmare—no one picked up the phone for 45 minutes! After finally getting through, someone brought us a tattered menu with scribbles all over it, and again, many items weren’t available. Ordering food became an ordeal.

As we await dinner, our expectations are at rock bottom. We can only hope to survive the next 48 hours in this place.

Noticed small bites on our backs' arms and legs (images attached). Thinking it was simply mosquitoes we had ignored issue until noticing that the two bites were definitely unique and apart. After speaking with several other hotel guests we quickly came to the conclusion that this was a bed bug infestation. 
We had made the hotel manager and reception aware around 16 February that something wasn’t right with the beds, only to be told that we would be given another room once it becomes available. As this didn’t happen for a good week, we then approached our Tui rep on the 24 February. Hence the above date of incident is technically incorrect as the matter was raised with the hotel manager at least a week prior to the recorded incident date by the Tui rep. To be fair once the Tui rep got involved, we were given another room the next day.  
The TUI rep attended along with the hotel manager on 24 February. In their report they were quick to conclude that it was as a result of ants due to some raw fruit that we had left in the room. This is completely untrue and absurd, yes we had a few whole fruits that we got from the hotel breakfast, not brought from outside. There were no ants in the original room, after closer inspection it was clear that there were very minute bugs on the beds. Hence bites mainly to our surface areas of skin that came into contact with the mattress.
We were astonished with the report of events from the Tui rep in their email and completely disagree with their versions of events. They had offered to even fumigate our room, due to my wife being an asthmatic we did not accept this offer. The hotel manager moved us to another room on the 24 February where we had no problems. However, in the new room there were considerable number of ants around the inner window seals (image attached).
We have taken the liberty to do some research on open source and were not surprised to find multiple feedback from other guests over the years having experienced the same issue. To reference a few cases, please enter ‘EKHO Surf Bentota bed bugs’ into any online search engine. Many reviews on ‘TripAdvisor, Make my Trip, Trivago’ to name a few. All specifically mention that trip was ruined by bed bugs and some go on to say worst hotel to stay in. Furthermore, reviews date back to December 2016 and also mention that the hotel has not done anything to sort out this issue else would be a perfect stay.        
We actually think that the staff have been great and the hotel and location on the whole has been splendid, so will be looking to add our own fair review. However, we cannot accept the hotel’s/ Tui rep’s version of events that it was due to ants! 
I have also attached the medications prescribed by my doctor following my return, consultation dated 02/03/2024. These are a combination of: -  
Co-amoxiclav: antibiotic to treat infections; 
Fexofenadine: antihistamine that relieves allergy symptoms;
Steroid cream like hydrocortisone cream to ease bedbug bites.

We had endured this uncomfortable room/bed since day 1 of our stay on 13 February until the 23rd February or 11 days of our 15 days stay. We hope our complaint can be looked at again and a fair cash compensation can be offered for our troubles. We had actually selected and paid for another hotel with Tui, namely ‘Coco Royal Beach Resort’. Unfortunately, Tui had cancelled this a few weeks before we were due to travel so had no other choice but to accept else alternatively cancelling our trip and 50th wedding anniversary.

TUI have completely dismissed the claim! TUI don't care about customer complaints nor does this resort. Book at your peril.","Bed bugs and ant infestation, hotel+TUI isn't all as it appears to be, so book at your peril!","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r961586508-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback.

Firstly, may I take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for some of the shortcomings you experienced while staying with us. It is clear there are couple of areas we can improve on and it’s only by receiving feedback sometimes we are made aware and can react, so thank you!
I've shared your feedback to my team regarding lack of service standards in both Housekeeping and Food and Beverage Departments, please rest assured that we have taken this feedback very seriously as we genuinely care about our guests and conduct regular training and inspections to ensure our product and services are up to standard and guest satisfaction.

We do strive to add value where we are able and again, I feel in the circumstances during your stay we seem to have missed the mark.

I hope that we will have the chance to possibly welcoming you again and if there is anything that I can be your assistant, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.

- Dirty floor in the room. I adviced the managent to clean my room again with clean water. They cleaned it again with dirty water, but added 3 black long hairs to the room. 🤮
The floor was still dirty after 4 days. Ive cleaned a small path on my own with a towel. (See pictures)
Send my dirty clothes to the lundery service and got it back 48h with bugs inside.
Some people of the restaurant service team are complete maniacs when they try to remove your old dishes from the table. We got ask if we are still eating, while eating. 🤡
They tried to steal the food i just got to the table. 
Breakfast and dinner are hot, stressfull and noisy experiences. 
Ordering drinks is weird in this house. Sometimes i asked multiple times to get some water. Once i got the ordered bottle of wine just before i was done eating.
Ordering lunch at ""der cafe"" takes at least 20-30 minutes. Feel lucky if the food is at least a bit warm.  
Dont try to order drinks in the ""comfy bar"" in the back of the lobby. The will let you rot in your thirst.

Thank you very much for giving us your feedback following your stay. I was indeed disappointed to read your comments because myself and my entire team helped you and your wife in every possible way for 2 days, spending hours and hours on checking CCTV from every possible angle.

Also we extended our fullest support towards the police investigations. I only commented that a robbery had never taken place in my hotel, but you were kept on blaming my staff saying ""they are the only ones who saw my money during check in because I opened the envelope Infront of them, so none other person did this except your staff""

Due to all above facts I strongly deny your comments on my staff. 

Furthermore you kept on blaming my receptionists, saying that you were not issued pool towel cards when we asked them on your departure, apparently appeared from your pocket when I requested to check your pockets for one last time.

Apart from the reservation of a room we also got the day package, where they said the lunch will be either served as a set menu or a buffet depending on the crowd. However, this specific day we got the set menu which was served as a limited menu. The food thoroughly disappointing as the taste was bland and the limited menu was not at all worth it. The prawn cracker had turned into extremely oily papadam served with white rice and pork which lacked any flavor. The tea/coffee served in the evening went straight into waste, as we prepared better teas ourselves. The food was utterly disappointing for reasons beyond comprehension.

We are genuinely surprised to hear your concerns, as this is not the type of feedback we typically receive. During your stay, we accommodated your needs, including providing lunch and arranging transport back. You also left a decent customer feedback, which makes this review quite unexpected. It would have been helpful if you had brought these concerns to our attention during our conversations, especially when we checked if everything was satisfactory. Nonetheless, we appreciate your feedback and will review these points internally.

Even if you wanted to refund the remaining nights due to your poor experience, we would have accommodated. Our chef works very hard in the kitchen so we are sorry in the process if somehow his immaculate uniform might have some food due to preparation. Yet we are confident of his capability and we have never had an issue with hygiene.

I was expecting a review of this nature. Especially after the ill treatment that you gave our staff in the hotel. 

Please firstly note the rooms are well over 50 Sqm in size and have all the amenities available in 5 star hotels normally. 

I met you personally at the hotel and listened to all your problems, assured you that in some instances we can always improve and yes we do need to provide a hair dryer in every room, which we will look towards doing in the near future. 

For the menu , we have never had a complaint and as explained to you face to face as well , it clearly stated at the bottom that there was a typo by the previous F & B manager who had mistakenly put ""not exclusive of government taxes"" , I informed you that even though this was clearly a typo , that in a gesture of good will we will honor your request to waive off the taxes and for the hotel to bear the cost. 

Please also note that you made the booking through an online travel agency (Booking.com) and the normal procedure there is that as per policy there is a prepayment made , when the booking period is less than 14 days from check in. 

This money is held in lockdown and the money is returned when the guest paids at check - in, however due to the circumstances you created this took emailing of approximately 10 days from the 3rd of July .

You instead cancelled the booking.com  booking for the first week of July , and asked us to waive off the non refundable fees , and booked directly with us at the front desk, rather than through booking.com

You did not inform booking.com of your actions as well in the process, along with that you demanded a special rate from the hotel. 

You then stayed one night of a three night stay, then well into the second day of check in around the evening you informed us that you had no money and that you needed us to pay for two private taxis to take you to the airport . We told you unfortunately we could do our best and accommodate one transfer at 50% of the cost  and pay it ourselves again as a sign of good will, as we waived off the taxes for the food as well. You then informed us that if we do not pay for your two shuttles that you would then not pay for the remaining two days (this was well into the second day evening when you gave the ultimatum)

We kindly informed that unfortunately we cannot accommodate your requests and that we are deeply sorry , and that instead we can provide you with the solution that we will only charge you one nights stay even though you stayed until 7 P.M of the second day at the hotel. 

We at Roman Beach are always open to constructive criticism. However if an individual wishes to hurt a business , and try to blackmail 
us with boorish behavior , we as a business have to draw a line somewhere. 

We always look to go over and beyond what is required to satisfy a guest, however if a guest demands a special rate, taxes to be waived off the food, a non refundable payment to be waived off by Booking.com for the whole stay, then also demands two free private taxis back to the airport threatening not to stay if not provided , then we have to kindly inform that we cannot stretch our service levels to these unfathomable levels. 

Please also note that only yesterday did we receive an email from the booking person that you received your full funds back into the account and you thanked us as well ! - This 

We have a very hard working team here at Roman Beach , who always look to satisfy a guest and go way beyond what is in their job description . 

Your behavior and treatment of everyone from the accountants team that worked to solve your issues with your finances, to the treatment of the wait staff and demanding taxes be removed because you found a typo is not in good grace and not fair on the hard working human beings that work for Roman Beach Hotel.

As a seasoned traveler, I I only book the best resort in the location I am visiting. Roman beach received such high marks on tripadvisor and agoda so I did not hesitate to book a two-night stay. Here are the issues we experienced in this hotel.

Restaurant - As we entered the restaurant there was no crew standing by to attend to us. We had to call someone's attention. Customers should NEVER have to call your attention. The sandwich I ordered was average.  The wok noodles were PATHETIC.  The prices were exorbitant for the food quality. Breakfast was Ok, nothing special. The restaurant is extremely understaffed and as a result, service was very slow. Unacceptable. 

Bedroom - 
Issue number 1: The missing remote control. We had to ask FOUR times on multiple occasions before they gave us a remote control for the tv - not something you want to waste time doing when you should be relaxing. 
Issue number 2: Stained sheets. This was feedback i read from a fellow guest in this hotel.  Apparently the resort did nothing about the feedback because we too found stained bed linens in our room. DISGUSTING. 
Issue number 3: Replacement of used towels. Our used bath towels were taken by housekeeping but guess what? They did not replace them with fresh ones. We only realized it after our next bath. Were we expected not to dry ourselves after a bath? ANNOYING. 
Issue number 4: We had leftover drinks from breakfast which we paid for and asked that it be delivered to our room. We got it 12 hours later.

And the biggest disappointment of all - the hotel refused to refund our second night stay. Agoda called the hotel and asked that they issue the refund but the hotel refused. I have it all documented on an email which Agoda sent me. We had a personal matter to attend to the following day and needed to return to Colombo urgently.  The hotel was not gracious enough to refund us for the second night. We were forced to stay the second day and manage our issue remotely so that we didn't have to waste money.

Safety hazard - it rained hard the second night and in the morning when i walked down to the restaurant, i slipped due to a huge puddle of water right inside the hotel lobby. I asked the guy cleaning the pool why there was water and he said it had rained last night. I asked why it had not been dried yet when the restaurant is already open for breakfast and told him that i slipped and could have hurt myself. He just said OK Sorry and when i returned 20 minutes later the water was STILL THERE. Apparently they don't care at all that their guests may slip and hurt themselves from their own negligence. I posted photos of the entire restaurant path area soaked in water. I wanted to speak with the manager but no one was in the front desk area at all. 

A final observation - the hotel is so uninviting and boring. It literally feels like a half way house. They don't play any music in the restaurant to create ambiance and promote relaxation. None of the guests were hanging by the pool because the lounge beds weren't set up. 

The two positive things I will say about this place are: 
1) That the staff are polite and courteous. No one was rude. But please don't think this positive trait makes up for anything. Courtesy and respect are minimum expectations - nothing special.
2) It's a beachfront hotel with a great view of the beach which is also visible from the room. 

To sum it up, the main problem with this hotel is that people do not pay keen ATTENTION TO DETAIL. There is also the absence of a Hotel Manager which is dreadfully disappointing and unacceptable. A manager should be present on EVERY SHIFT. That is how things work in the hospitality industry. These are the traits that sets a place apart from the rest. Roman beach hotel is not a luxury resort by any standard. 

Every resort should give the customer a refund if asked. By doing this, you are showing the customer that you are not desperate to take their money and instead value their satisfaction and experience MORE than making a buck. By allowing the refund I would have very nicely commended the resort and published my comments on tripadvisor and agoda. But since they did not grant the refund, well, no such kudos is deserved and NO REFERRALS whatsoever. 

I will not return to Roman Beach hotel nor will I recommend it to any of my friends in Sri Lanka and the Philippines.  Management of this hotel has a lot of work to do. New hotels are popping up in the area and if nothing is done to improve the level of service drastically,  this place stands no chance of surviving.","Impersonal, Inconsiderate, Ghastly Experience, Grossly Disappointing.","2014-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r234550506-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

As a valued guest, we would love the opportunity to make things right. Please let us know if there’s anything we can do to improve your future visits. We sincerely hope to welcome you back for a much better dining experience soon.

As a seasoned traveler and someone with experience in hospitality, my stay here was far from pleasant. I arrived around 7pm and due to the dim lighting, I didn't immediately notice how dirty the room was. Planning to stay just one night before my flight, I woke up to find excessive dust everywhere - on the coffee table, desk, bed headboard, and even the floor. The kettle was filthy, and the noise level was intolerable, with footsteps audible from neighboring rooms.

To top it off, the toilet had a conspicuous stain that clearly hadn't been addressed for some time. Additionally, there were dirty mugs left around the bathroom floor and towels, one of which jumped like a flea when I touched it. I documented these issues and showed them to management. The general manager apologized, attributing the problems to the room being new, which I find unacceptable both as a hotelier and as a guest paying $160 for the night without breakfast.

When I expressed my dissatisfaction, he merely apologized again and handed me his card, offering no compensation or attempt to rectify the situation. At checkout, the receptionist nonchalantly assumed that deducting the $10 breakfast cost from my bill was sufficient compensation. I told him that such a token gesture didn't address the magnitude of my disappointment.

After seeing my reaction, the duty manager intervened and eventually offered an extra free night, which unfortunately wasn't feasible for me.

Greetings From Vivanta!

Thank you for choosing Vivanta and sharing your feedback with us. We have read your comment and shared it with respective departments in concern. Since they have checked with many areas and logbooks, an issue with the hairdryer has not been found, and even after been checked through the reception desk there has been no record regarding a guest that has asked for a hairdryer. Yet as one of the Taj Hotel, we always try our best to keep everything up to standard. Since it is not possible to find any evidence regarding this issue, I would like you to share your booking details; your name and room number you stayed and the date of your stay for further checking which even helps us to identify what may have had happened. 

Anyways we rely on constructive feedback of our discerning guests to help us achieve the highest levels of services that we aspire towards. Thanking you again and we look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,

No welcome when we arrived from Yasas, we got a mumbled hello and that was it.  I was told to have two people in the room there would be a surcharge, so we paid a double rate ($150 USD) but there is only one of everything in the room. 1 key, 1 cup, 1 bathrobe etc. Bathrobe grubby and frayed. No view of garden and lagoon as our superior room description promised . Rooms smell of smoke although non smoking, place feels like a prison block. No milk for coffee, no bottle opener, no bathroom amenities. 

I would have never stayed if I knew how rude the staff would be, and how poor the rooms and amenities are.

The airport was located forty-five minutes away from the city but things are a bit better now with a new toll highway.  However, when you have a layover of less than ten hours (like this occasion), the Gateway Hotel is your only decent choice.  The hotel has a new lobby and the baggage staffs were mostly friendly.  The check in clerk was also friendly and I was given a room quickly.  

However the room was pretty rundown.  It is an upgraded room but the facilities don't quite click.  The bathroom is huge but the amenities have cutback severely.  Not even shampoo or conditioner.  The rest of the room is fine but all the electricity in the room failed an hour after takeoff.  I have to call for an engineer.  Given it was late at night, they managed to find someone quickly.  However, it shortened my sleep time. 

The only good thing is that they answered my email quickly and arranged good airport transportation.  Please note that they no longer have free airport transportation.  

In conclusion, if you have a short layover, the Gateway Hotel is an acceptable choice.  However please expect a holiday inn experience, rather than a Hilton or Sheraton.  But if you have longer layover, please do yourself a flavor and stay at one of the newer nicer hotels in downtown Colombo.","Disappointing Stay but the only decent airport hotel option","2019-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736162-d304699-r657847457-Vivanta_Colombo_Airport_Garden-Seeduwa_Western_Province.html",

Nothing even close to the TAJNESS that I have experienced many a times before in various other Taj Properties around the world. However, I have a question to the management because it really made me think and uncomfortable as I have never been asked such a question ever in any of my stays anywhere on a spa form.

When I went for my spa appointment I was asked by your staff to fill up a form asking if I have any any health issues and there was a whole list out there which is still very personal but understandable as some therapies might not be advised. But why is it important for your guest to mention their NATIONALITY before a spa appointment ??
I didn’t think it should be anyone’s concern so I left it blank however I was insisted by the staff to fill it which I did and asked the staff what is the significance of this information and staff was just quiet and had no answer at all.This experience has left me very uncomfortable..

I thought he is a robot saying the same word without suggesting any other options or adding some explanations.

i had hotel buffet in many different hotels around the world but this is the first time to hear that ""they dont have drink for buffet"" and I think the first glass of juice I had was lucky to have that cause clearly it was their mistake to leave it on the table. 
They saw me having juice from the unattended juice jar and they removed it right after that even though there were plenty left and they said it finished and no drink left for buffet. 
I felt that is all to force customers to order chargeable drink separately to make extra money.

Greetings from Villa Republic Galle!

Firstly I would like to mention you that this review does not apply to Villa Republic Galle since you stayed at our Bentota property, Villa Republic Bentota.

But we would like to reply to your review in this platform itself since take all of our guests’ feedback very seriously so we can always strive to improve their experience with us.

You checked in to our property on 14th May 2018 and the original departure date was 15th May 2018. After satisfying with our property and service you even extend the booking for 15th night and checked out on 16th May 2018. 

The first call we received regarding this complain was after you checkout and once you reached the Airport therefore there is no proof that you actually lost money at the Villa. At the same time we have inquired regarding this from our staff members and we have sent Ms Zainab Hussaini an email stating our staff members are unaware of this situation.

Regarding the payment we refuse this accusation since you have made this payment via booking.com and both payments were credit card transactions. Only the grocery bills were supposed to be pay by cash. For grocery bills we always inform guests to settle the provided Supermarket bills nothing more.

We have only three staff members there and they have been with us for more than seven years now.

Our all rooms have safes to keep personal belongings secure therefore as management we are unable to take responsibility over cash/valuables kept outside locked safes. As travelers we need to take safety measurements over personal belongings regardless the place you travel.

Also at end of our stay I noticed $500 was missing from my wallet along with another $200 from my sisters purse. They have cctv cameras there the manager informed me they would run thru the footage and get back to me. After a few hrs no one got back to me when I called them back they told me the cctv cameras are not working and they weren’t responsible for any missing items. The place looks beautiful but our stay was a nightmare would not recommend this place to anyone especially if you have family and have expensive belongings there is no privacy. Also management was supposed to refund me 3,600 Sri Lankan rupees because we paid with dollars and they were supposed to refund the difference and never did when I asked the manager for the refund they claimed the gave it to family memeber who left the night before when I put him on the phone with the manager all of the sudden they couldn’t speak English.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your stay. We understand how important a peaceful environment is for our guests, and we are truly sorry that your visit did not meet your expectations.

Please allow us to clarify that our property is built around a unique concept — it is not a traditional hotel, but rather an experience designed to give guests an authentic journey from ""leaf to cup"" inside a working tea factory environment. As part of this immersive concept, our rooms are constructed to reflect the original structure, and while we strive to maintain guest comfort, soundproofing is limited due to the building’s historic and open design.

To preserve the tranquil and reflective nature of the space, we consistently brief all guests during check-in and have placed multiple signboards requesting everyone to ""Keep Silent."" Our team frequently reminds guests to maintain a respectful noise level, although unfortunately, not all behavior is within our control.

We are truly sorry for the discomfort you faced and assure you that we are taking your feedback seriously. Measures will be further reviewed to enhance the experience for all our guests. We hope to welcome you again in the future, and we will make every effort to ensure a more peaceful and enjoyable stay.

Warm regards,

The hotel management should clearly inform guests before booking that the rooms are not soundproof. People travel around five hours from Colombo to reach this place, only to be forced to listen to the unpleasant noises of other guests, with no privacy whatsoever.

Please soundproof the rooms properly before continuing operations.

Thank you for sharing your recent experience at Tea and Experience Hotel. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you encountered during your stay.

 

We acknowledge your concerns regarding the room smell, and we have taken immediate action to address this issue. Measures such as spraying air fresheners and lighting citronella oil lamps have been implemented as a temporary solution. Upon investigation, we could not identify any specific source in the rooms; however, we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

 

Regarding the pool temperature, we would like to clarify that maintaining consistent temperatures in an outdoor pool can be challenging, especially considering the current weather conditions. However, we are pleased to note that many guests enjoy the unique experience it offers in the outdoor setting, particularly in colder weather.

 

Your feedback regarding the dining experiences is invaluable, and we are committed to enhancing the quality of our offerings. On a positive note, we would like to highlight the encouraging feedback we have received in reviews about our food. We value your criticism as it guides us in our ongoing efforts to improve.

 

We sincerely appreciate your understanding. Please feel free to reach out to us directly if you have any further concerns or if there's anything we can do to make amends.

Afterwards, we experienced rotting smell from a corner of the room and called room service to do something about it. Then We went for evening tea and when we came back dead animal rotting smell was not there and replaced by strong chemical  smell.  But when we came back from dinner, the chemical smell was worn off and rotting animal smell came back again. As it was late into night, we tried to sleep under blankets to reduce smell. 

The next day, the morning smell was so bad, so We asked the hotel manager to come and see the situation. He came and inspected the room and informed us that the animal is rotting in gutters and could not do anything about it.

 I have never experienced such disregard for guests in any hotel so far. Isn't it the responsibility of the hotel manager to ensure the cleanliness of rooms before giving it for guests' occupation? 
Even though we booked Periya Dorei's family suit, the only view we got was corroded roof of the factory. It was very disappointing. So in order to keep away from the room, We thought about dip in the hotel pool at around 10.30 am but found it was ice cold. 

We went to this Tea and experience hotel after day at Glendevon Scottish Bungalow, thinking about having a dip in the pool, but the pool was not usable. 

During dinner buffet for Sunday night, Jelly  served in desert to be stale and repugnant. When we complained, Chef came and told us new batch of jelly brought for the hotel taste like that. But on our day of departure, one of the helpers at the restaurant thanked us for complaining about bad food. I feel they are helpless.

 Bread slices given for breakfast on 11th December 2023 didn't seem to be fresh and of poor taste. 

Even though the hotel is situated in a beautiful location and trekking up to KabaraElla Falls, is great, hotel food and room cleanliness are below average

and other points were also taken positively and seriously. and will pass this message on to the top management for further disposition.

Food was not great and the quality needs to really improve. I found that the policy of not serving coffee ( because it’s tea experience) a ridiculous policy.

The staff was wonderful and took care of us and the concept of staying at a tea factory. The views and garden was also lovely. Sadly, these were the only good things I could say about the hotel.

The rooms as comfortable as they were with heating, hot water and beautiful views, were not soundproof at all. We could hear conversations in the next room, people snoring in other rooms and were woken up at 6am to kids running up and down and playing. The menus could have been planned better, though the food tasted good, it was a big mix of multiple cuisines spread across a few dishes where you will have to choose between a rice/ pasta with an indian curry and a veg chop suey.

These sadly werent even the worst thing about this place. We could have forgiven this. The manager made our experience even worse. There was only one common area in the hotel other than the dining room which was the bar. When we asked to sit there the manager refused saying that guests will be walking through there and can hear us. Instead we were made to sit out in the cold in the night on plastic chairs. Wrapped in as many layers as we could just to play some boardgames and hang out. On our second night, upon refusing to sit out in the cold we were made to sit in their engine room which smelled of oil and cement and had a single tube light. Aparently the dining room was being set up for the next meal and therefore we couldnt sit there. The walk through the warm dining room into the cold, dark, unwelcoming engine room was depressing. I only wish I took a picture as anyone would be horrified.

Finally our last straw was being denied being allowed to sit out in the garden and have our afternoon tea (when the weather is warmer) the reasons to which I still do not understand.

You are aware that you arrived around midnight during a storm. This is the monsoon period, and we sometimes experience stormy weather. During these storms, the resort looks in disarray, with plenty of fallen leaves littering the garden and the swimming pool. This would have been your first impression. We had arranged a housekeeping supervisor on duty to show you to the room on arrival without delay.
At departure, you had written on the guest registration card that you were not happy with the ambiance nor the cleanliness of the room but found the bed comfortable. 
We are sorry you did not stay longer at the resort to really experience it and find your hurried judgment unjustifiable. We have a system that all rooms are checked prior to release and this ensures that all linen are in good condition and the room is properly cleaned and the bathroom works properly. If you had issues to the contrary like the towels and flow of water, this could have been intimated at checkout.
We hope you will visit us to see and experience the hotel, which we are sure will change your judgment, which is misleading to other readers.

- Airport transfer was arranged as planned through another company and it was on time and comfortable.

-The room was dirty, no fire alarm, washed out, mould, even a moth was hovering around.

-The towels were so old with strings hanging out.

-Hot water didn’t work and the water was clogging not draining.

- The jacuzzi was outdated yellowish.

-The back door was not sealing and locking properly.

- As it was middle of the night we decided to nap for a few hours and early 7.30 we went down to the reception to request for a check out.

- The staff were friendly however oblivious to the current state of the property. He offered us different room, and it was not any better.

- The cherry on the top was we were asked to pay for that one night (the few hours we spent from Midnight till 7AM). 

-We paid and just got out of the place as fast as we could.

Our investigations revealed that you were really disappointed that you lost your handsfree. Our staff did their utmost but could not find it. We are sorry you lost this but it is a large area including the beach.

For 400usd/ night you expect to stay in a proper 5 stars hotels with high standards everywhere. Except the restaurant it was far to be the case.

I will recommend this hotel with pleasure only when they will have aligned to the market and positioned differently.

1st, the location is awkward, it's in between the Galle Fort Old Town and Unawatuna main beach. So we need to take tuktuk to ""fun places"". 

2nd, for the rate we got, way over priced. The room was ok, but it's got an early 2000 feeling. Hotel facilities were very poor. Lobby is small and heavily windy, gym is a joke, pool is not very clean. 

3rd, service was all over the place. One doorman was really nice and informative. One housekeeping guy was rude and impolite. The guy asked us three times when to check out on our last night of stay. And literally said that "" I need to know your time so I can clean the room"".

Rating is poor at best due to a multitude of things...... 

We thought the staff were top notch... very endearing and always with a smile willing to go the extra mile.... This and the alcove beach are the real attractions and winner of this place..... Venture a bit further to jungle beach on the next bend and you will find a tad better beach. 

Rooms - Extremely spacious, has the required trappings etc. AC's don't work properly. Jacuzi cannot be used as the power trips out. The finishing touches are cheap for the price tag of the hotel. Door and windows dont close / seal properly which means the AC cannot function at its best. A pity as the rooms have the potential to command and create some real awe,,,

Food - For an al la catre menu poor quantity (its not a epicurean) and more importantly quality.  Only exception was the traditional SL breakfast.... At dinner prawns were flaky (which means it was old), baked crab was tangy..did not venture too far into the meal as we were both not too confident. English breakfast had one measly wrinkled sausage which was obviously taken straight out of the freezer. tenderloin was more bone.... if you are pricing for exclusivity guests need to be given quality,. 
There are quite a few like minded places who get the little things right.... 

We ended up doing  quick run to Galle fort and Hiks for some stunning meals.... this should not be the case as guests expect a degree of quality.

Hotel is still in its infancy so there is room to develop.... but at circa $300 ++ per night you are looking at places that offer seriously much better value and quality on an overall basis.... 

I am surprised considering the people behind this project are no slouches in the trade having previously been part of some successful ventures... However, it lacks the exclusive panache and touches that is expected with such a price tag. Again drawing paraleels to places along the coastal belt that prices itself between $200 upwards.... 

As initially alluded the place does have potential and most importantly they have the staff with the right attitude,,,,,,, but I believe there is poor direction and attention to detail from management. In my books this is no more than a $150 -175 until such time things are put in place.

The hotel itself is very nice, good rooms, nice bath rooms, nice views and is located in the beginning of Unawatuna close to Galle Fort (a 10 minute tuk tuk ride away). There isn't much of a beach around the hotel, and the area behind the hotel has some litter. 

The staff at the hotel were friendly and accommodated a request for a birthday cake making my husbands birthday quite special and we came back to towel elephants on our bed and a message saying 'happy birthday' which was quite sweet.

We left Coco Bay feeling that we had salvaged some of our holiday which we had struggled to enjoy due to the services of a tour company called Flywing tours and their driver Jegan whom we had dismissed on our drop off to this hotel due to his dishonesty, attempts to con us and his very dangerous driving. 

However it seems (from a number of abusive messages later sent to us by the driver following his dismissal by us) that he had been informed by the staff at this hotel that we had had problems with our credit card (a forgotten pin so we used a different account card) and didn't have cash to pay for our stay (a complete and utter lie). This detail, albeit incorrect, could only have come from the hotel staff who were around when we were paying our bill and checking out.

We really can't understand why the staff at Coco Bay would do this, especially after we confided in the manager Reny our concerns about this driver and even showed him the abusive text message that was sent to us. He told us not to worry and took down the drivers telephone number and company details and assured us that the hotel was secure and that we should enjoy the rest of our holiday. We trusted him and the other staff and cannot understand why they would go behind our backs and say these things to this driver who they knew there was clearly a problem with. We feel really betrayed.

I can only say that we are really disappointed that what we thought was the best hotel of our trip has actually turned out to be the worst because of their actions.","Coco bay - good hotel but betrayed by staff","2013-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3386434-r162314799-CoCoBay_Unawatuna-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your review following your recent visit.

We regret to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations and would like to address your concerns.

Kindly note that we have conducted a detailed internal review, including checking CCTV footage and staff records. Our findings indicate the following

•	Check-in Experience: Contrary to your statement, no guests were seen cutting the line or being prioritized. Your check-in process took 12 minutes, and the delay was solely due to a missing identification document from your group, which was later resolved with a digital passport copy.
•	Recheck-in and room availability: At no point were you informed that the hotel was fully occupied. Your rebooking was successfully made via our online platform at 09:00 hrs, and our team began assisting you upon your arrival at 10:00 hrs. CCTV footage confirms a 17-minute recheck-in process with no other guests at the counter during that time. However, we acknowledge that the process may not have felt as seamless as expected, and we regret any frustration this may have caused. 
•	Room cleaning: We regret if our housekeeping interaction felt unprofessional and will follow up with the relevant team to ensure improved communication going forward.  
•	Food delivery: Please note that, as an operational procedure, we do not handle outside food deliveries due to health and safety reasons. Guests are required to collect such orders from the entrance. We apologize if this caused any inconvenience.

At Cinnamon Red, we take every concern seriously, but we also stand by our team when the facts and documentation do not support the allegations made. It is disheartening to see a review written with such harshness, particularly when many of the claims are not substantiated.

Nonetheless, your feedback has been noted and shared with senior management.

I used to rate it 5 stars. I used to recommend it to friends and family. But after this recent stay, I’ll never come back — and I hope management takes this seriously because things are falling apart fast.

To the management:
You desperately need to retrain your staff. Whatever standards you once had are clearly gone. Hospitality isn’t just about rooms — it’s about respect, service, and care. Right now, none of that exists here.

Let me break down the four situations that made my stay a complete nightmare:

1. Check-in was a disaster.
It was slow, disorganized, and beyond frustrating. I waited for ages while others cut the line with the staff just ignoring it. It set the tone for what turned out to be an awful stay.

2. Lied to about room availability.
I asked to extend my stay — they told me the hotel was full. Turns out, that was a lie. I checked online right there and booked a room from their own site. When I showed this, they gave me the runaround, wasting my time and acting like they were doing me a favor. Unbelievable.

3. Rude and unprofessional housekeeping.
When I requested cleaning the next morning, the cleaner showed up and started interrogating me about when I checked in and why the room needed cleaning again. Then he blamed the reception team like it was my fault. I’m here to rest, not get caught in your internal mess.

4. Food delivery drama.
I ordered food via Uber Eats, and the driver brought it to the entrance. I asked the staff to collect it from reception — totally normal, right? Nope. The outside crew refused to even let the driver park. One staff member, Manohara, insisted the driver just wait until I came downstairs. Even after I made it crystal clear to just take the delivery, the way they treated the driver — and me — was downright rude and dismissive.

I’m angry. I’m disappointed. I’m done with this place.
This hotel used to feel welcoming — now it just feels like a joke. If anyone in management actually cares, fix this. Fast.","Getting Worst","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r1006682243-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you faced, particularly regarding the room key mix-up and the issues encountered during your stay. We understand that this must have been frustrating, and we regret that your experience did not meet expectations.

We were first given the card of the wrong room and walked into someone showering. The second card they gave to a different room didn't work and we had to make our way back to the lobby once more to get it validated. This card promptly stopped working the next evening, leaving us stuck outside our room, tired and with baggage after work. The next day housekeeping had broken our shower head and we had water spray all over when we turned it on.
All these were fixed within 10 to 15 minutes. But the sheer load of issues, along with the slightly run down look of the rooms made us realise that they don't really care about customer experience any more.. they have enough business coming in to AFFORD inattention to detail.
So next time, we'll stay someplace else.

Thank you for sharing your feedback following your recent stay. We sincerely regret any inconvenience you and your colleagues faced during the check-out process.
Upon investigating the matter, our records indicate that hand towels were placed in the room upon arrival, and our housekeeping team noted their absence during the final room inspection.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We’d like to address your concerns directly.
Cinnamon Red Colombo operates as a lean luxury hotel, so welcome drinks are not part of our offerings, but we appreciate your suggestion. We regret the buffet didn’t meet your expectations, and your comments have been shared with our culinary team.
We acknowledge that our bathroom doors are unlockable by design and regret any inconvenience this may have caused.
The safety locker was replaced promptly upon request. Regarding the TV, our technician noted an issue with the sound and offered to replace the HDMI cable, though we understand you preferred to delay the repair.
We apologize for the check-in delay and have shared your feedback with our front office team to improve this process. For the key card, as indicated on the card itself, it’s valid only during your stay, and reactivation is required for any extended time.
Further, we regret that the futon couch we offered didn’t meet your comfort standards. Additionally, two complimentary water bottles are provided per room, with extra bottles available at a small charge.
We’re glad you enjoyed the view from the 22nd floor and thank you for your valuable feedback—it helps us improve our guest experience.
Best Wishes!

Terrible experience. Will never visit again! This might be my last stay at a Cinnamon hotel.

This is my third experience with Cinnamon hotels. Previously, I stayed at Cinnamon Citadel Kandy (2021) and Cinnamon Bey Beruwala (2024). This was my 8th hotel stay this year (2024). The other hotels I stayed at this year were Jetwing Lake Dambulla (March 2024), Cinnamon Bey Beruwala (June 2024), Turyaa Kalutara (July 2024), Golden Ridge Nuwara Eliya (October 2024), Heritance Ahungalle (October 2024), Earl's Regency Kandy (October 2024), Cinnamon Red (October 2024), and Citrus Waskaduwa (scheduled for November 2024, which will be my third stay).

Previously, I had positive experiences at Cinnamon Bey Beruwala, and Cinnamon Red has a stunning view, which is why I chose this hotel over Marino Beach or Taj Samudra. The budget or price wasn't an issue, as I typically avoid hotels below 4 stars. Before booking, I knew this was a 3-star hotel, but I assumed it had that rating due to the smaller rooms (26m²). I wasn’t sure how hotel ratings work, but I thought it might still be a decent choice. I was wrong. In my opinion, this hotel doesn't even deserve 2 stars.

Here’s what went wrong:

1. No welcome drinks: I asked the reception why they don’t offer welcome drinks to in-house guests, and they said, “This is a budget and business hotel.” That’s not a proper excuse—welcome drinks don’t cost much and are a nice gesture for guests. Even hotels without star ratings offer welcome drinks.

2. Poor buffet spread: The buffet was very minimal, almost like a mini buffet. For Rs. 6,000 per dinner, it was a waste of money. You can get a much better spread at other hotels in Colombo. To me, it wasn't worth more than Rs. 3,500 due to the lack of variety.

3. No bathroom door locks: This was unbelievable. It might be fine for couples, but this hotel doesn’t only accommodate couples—families and friends stay here too. We’re not nudists or aborigines! We had to use a bathroom on a different floor. How can they not have locks on bathroom doors?

4. Faulty safety locker and TV: The room’s safety locker didn’t work, and we had to wait 20 minutes for it to be replaced. The TV had no sound, and while they offered to fix it by replacing a cable, we declined since we didn’t want to waste more time. Why aren’t these things checked before guests check in?

5. Delayed check-in: Check-in was supposed to be at 2 P.M., but we had to wait over 40 minutes for our room.

6. Late checkout issue: We requested a 1-hour late checkout since the reception wasted our time during check-in, and they agreed. However, our room key stopped working after 12:00 P.M., and I had to go back to reception to reactivate it.

7. Terrible extra bed: The extra bed felt like a coffin—extremely uncomfortable.

8. No free extra water bottles: They don’t even provide extra water bottles for free

Actually in this my review i gave 2 star over 1 star because they give me a 22nd floor room. If not this would be 1 star rating","Very disappointed","2024-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r974901384-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We regret that your experience did not meet your expectations. Regarding the early check-in charge, it's important to note that our standard check-in time is 2 PM, and you checked in before 10 AM. The half-day charge for early check-ins depends on availability and occupancy levels, and on the day of your arrival, the hotel was running at high occupancy, which resulted in the full night's charge.

As for the taxi charges, please note that the taxis at the hotel are available as a service and can be used at the discretion of our guests We are aware that there are cheaper options available. Our guests are certainly not obliged to use our transport services.

We hope this clarifies.

Thank you for providing feedback on your recent stay at Cinnamon Red Colombo. 
Upon careful investigation of the issues you raised, we would like to provide some clarification.
Upon review of the check-in, it was noted that you arrived before the standard check-in time. Despite this, our Front Office staff made arrangements to accommodate your early arrival. Both rooms were ready by 12:23 PM, and our staff even ensured that the rooms were next to each other. Additionally, you expressed gratitude for the complimentary early check-in.
Regarding the calculation issue during your check-out, our records revealed that there was no error made by our staff. You had initially booked two single rooms on a bed-and-breakfast basis, when the requirement was for two rooms for four persons. Upon arrival, you disputed this and claimed to have reserved two double rooms instead. Our Front office staff member promptly showed you the booking details, which clearly indicated the pax count selected during the reservation process. After reviewing the information provided, you acknowledged the error on your part and agreed to pay for the additional breakfast on consumption, which was amicably agreed. You had also requested a complimentary breakfast for the two additional persons which we politely declined.
Furthermore, during your check-out, there was no miscalculation in the charges presented to you. Our team clearly outlined the total amount due, including applicable taxes, in both USD and LKR currencies. It was explained to you that an additional SSC tax would be incurred if payment was to be made in LKR. The additional tax (SSC) is imposed as per the regulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.  However, this too was waived on your request. 
Upon checkout, you demanded that you are entitled to a balance payment of LKR 119.85, since you had previously settled the bill in USD and then made a balance payment of LKR 15,000. Initially, you informed the associate who checked you in that you didn’t want the balance amount. This was, however, refunded back to you.
Further, you had not requested to speak to a manager at checkout; instead, you had mentioned to the associate that you had communicated the above refund to the manager upon arrival, which you had not. You claim that the Manager was standing in a corner smiling. We see no harm in that, as he was interacting with other guests. 
In response to your comments about the food quality, we regret that it did not meet your expectations.
Your review portrays the hotel and staff in a poor light, whereas we have gone the extra mile to accommodate the many requests you had, from a complimentary early check-in, to waiving the additional tax. We acknowledge though that as a customer, it is your privilege to review us as you deem fit.

We have thoroughly investigated the matter you raised about the hot water issue, and we would like to inform you that no complaint was brought to our attention during your stay. We have also checked the hot water in the room after receiving your review, and can assure you that there is no issue with hot water in this room.

We regret that you did not bring this matter to our attention during your 8 night stay , as our dedicated staff is always ready to address any concerns promptly. We pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service, and we would have been more than happy to assist you immediately had we known about the issue.

Thank you for providing feedback on your recent stay at Cinnamon Red. We appreciate your time and want to address the concerns you have raised.
In reference to the incident at the reception, we would like to clarify that our operational procedures regarding foreign currency are strictly dictated by Central Bank regulations. The rejection of the 20-dollar note and the inability to provide change for the 100-dollar note were in compliance with these regulations, and our Front Office Associate did her best to explain this.
The option to withdraw money from an ATM or visit a licensed commercial bank for currency exchange was presented as an alternative, as we are unable to bypass the strict foreign currency regulations enforced by the Government of Sri Lanka. Additionally, the information about the additional tax when paying in LKR was shared in adherence to the country's regulations, not as an attempt to inconvenience you.
Regarding the incident with the insect in the breakfast packet, we take matters of hygiene seriously and sincerely apologize for this. Our team has thoroughly investigated the matter and is reinforcing our already stringent procedures to prevent any such incidents in the future.
Your feedback is invaluable as we continually strive to enhance our guest experience. We hope you understand the challenges we face due to external regulations and appreciate your consideration.

The reception team, who should serve as the face of the hotel, lacked a warm welcome and failed to provide a positive experience.

During my six-night stay, I encountered an unpleasant incident with Miss Dulasha at the reception including her manager. Despite an initially pleasant interaction, issues arose when I attempted to pay in USD. A 20-dollar note with a minor pen mark was rejected, and later, when I requested change for a 100-dollar note, they claimed Central Bank requirements prevented them from providing change in dollars.

After a frustrating 45-minute ordeal, during which they refused to give change for USD and attempted to charge an additional 2.5% fee for paying in LKR, I resorted to using my credit card, incurring extra currency transaction fees. This experience left us feeling discriminated against, as if our nationality affected the level of respect we received.

Additionally, a disappointing incident occurred during check-out when I discovered a cockroach in one of the breakfast boxes I had requested. Despite reporting it to the hotel immediately, this added to the overall dissatisfaction of my stay.

While the rooms were commendable, credit goes to the diligent room boy, S S Dilakshan. I sincerely hope that this feedback reaches the appropriate channels at Cinnamon Red. The decline in service quality is disheartening, and I believe investing in effective hospitality management for the reception team could significantly improve the overall experience. Best wishes to Cinnamon Red in addressing these concerns and maintaining the high standards expected from the Cinnamon Hotel chain.","Disappointing Experience","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r931254472-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We refer to your review following your visit to our hotel.  We apologize we were unable to offer you a higher floor room as you requested, due to the occupancy prevalent on the day. Further, several of our departing guests were still in house at 10AM, as check-out is at 12 noon. The best we could do at that time based on availability was the 16th floor.
 
Based on our records, we can confirm that the booking agent did not confirm a room on the 25th floor, even though you claimed so. In fact, at no stage during your conversation with the Agent, was a room on the 25th floor even mentioned, and the booking confirmation sent to you on email clearly mentions that the higher floor room is subject to availability. The recording of the conversation between the Agent and yourself will be sent to your email address, in order to refresh your memory on what was discussed.
 
We regret that you chose to blame our staff for being incompetent and rude for no fault of theirs, when the issue was clearly a misunderstanding on your part.

Unfortunately, despite the significant price increase (150% more), the quality has dropped considerably. For a hotel that advertises itself as a wellness destination, the environment does not provide the tranquility one would expect. The constant noise from the restaurant, both from the kitchen and the staff, made the experience unpleasant. Additionally, disturbances caused by guests in the next room during the evening and by the staff early in the morning further disrupted the sense of relaxation.

Another negative aspect was the internet, which was extremely slow—something unacceptable for a hotel charging 800 euros per night. The cleanliness was also subpar, with the room windows, both top and bottom, visibly dirty. To make matters worse, at the restaurant, we were asked to keep the cutlery between courses, which is not appropriate for a service of this standard.

Overall, the hotel seems to have lost focus on customer experience and the essence of a wellness retreat. I do not recommend staying here until these issues are addressed, especially given the high cost.","Not worth the money paid","2024-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r987961768-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

I have visited many beautiful hotels in my life all over the world as I love boutique hotels and unique architectural projects. 
I was very excited to visit Santani as I heard a lot about it.

Well…. My conclusion was that this hotel is totally overrated and insanely overpriced for what you get!

I had very high expectations after reading all the reviews and especially after paying so much money when booking through my travel agent.

I was supposed to stay 4 nights as I came to rest but very quickly after my arrival I felt I would not stay the full time. The reason:
My very loud and noisy room!

After a very messy and totally inappropriate arrival (road was obstructed and we needed to change car and tuk tuk twice) I was brought to my room, a “garden view Room “ at the end of a dark road near very dense bushes. There was absolutely no garden to see but very wild and densely packed vegetation.

The bungalow with the “garden rooms “is very isolated and has absolutely no garden view. They are located in a very dark area noisy spot without light and air, 7-8min walk from the main buiding. Rooms are very close to eachother. They are totally open allaround it: no walls till the ceiling: so EXTREMELY NOISY! 

The rooms have absolutely no charm and comfort (very dark, no AC, no air, no tv, no view). The bathroom also is extremely basic and not very clean.

The night came and I immediately noticed the room was very very noisy due to the proximity of the dense bushes all around. Also the sound of the neighbours including flushing toilets, sound of conversations and staff talking nearby was heard extremely well from room to room.
No privacy possible when all neighbours can hear eachother. 

Obviously with decibels reaching easily the sound of traffic (between 60-90 decibels) I could not sleep at all that first night. Especially the frogs, birds and various insects were EXTREMELY LOUD and agitated.
You can literally hear the same way as if you would sleep in a tent in the middle of the jungle.

I was expecting a very quiet and nice experience instead it was a nightmare and stressy experience: a sleepless agitated night.

Also my room was at the end of a very dark and scary muddy road, without sufficient lighting. Very challenging to reach especially in the dark after dinner.

This made my experience not enjoyable at all.

I spoke about the sleeping issue to the staff but they were totally unhelpful, telling me they will get back to me. 

After 2 horrible night, without any sleep, I begged the staff to find a solution but they were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. They did not get back to me. Only After 2 nights adressing the noise problem, they told me I had to address the issue to my travel agent which I did immediately.

I got informed that they would not do anything about the problem and that the open rooms was part of the concept of the hotel to have open rooms with the sound of Nature. 
They could upgrade me to a more silent room (mountain view) but with paying surcharge and only for 1 night, next night I would have had to change again to the initial Garden View Room.

As I was very upset not having slept 2 nights in a row, I decided I could not have another 2 sleepless nights. 
As the manager didn’t want to help I decided to leave the property and check out from the hotel.

Having stayed 2 nights only instead of 4 they refused to reimburse my last 2 nights. So basically I lost the 2 last nights without reimbursement (more then 700$ lost).

About the rest of the hotel:
Restaurant
I went for dinner several times as it is included in the package: full pension.
During my first meal they forgot to ask what I wanted to drink (my drink was served after I finished my meal). It happened a few times again.

The meal came after 3min I sat down. I chose the Sri Lankan menu which all came together. Food was very good but I finished my meal and the entire meal took about 15-20 minutes. 
It is not a very cosy moment. Everything is served very quick and they don’t take the time to make it a long lasting experience.
They don’t ask you for example if you still want something after the desert.
It felt each time very expedited, like it had to go very quick: you come you go as fast as possible. Maximum time I was there was 20- 25minutes. 
The food was very good, unfortunately the fish was not very well cooked.
But in general the food is excellent.

Architecture 
Very beautiful main building. Too bad the groundfloor is not very cosy: I wanted to sit to read a book but also very loud because of the wood floor from the restaurant.

Garden maintenance is not very well taken care of.

Swimming pool area is very bad: nobody is there (no staff): no towels are given, no possibility to order drinks or food. When I arrived every chair was left with used towels from previous guests. I didn’t know if I could use a chair as they were all used.
I stayed at least 1,5 hour and didn’t see any staff in that time.
This is not what you expect from this type of hotel.

Welness: 
Is a joke,
I wanted to book a session but there was no available place for the next 48hours.
I only did the yoga class which was OK. 
I also used the sauna/ hammam. Unfortunately there was nobody there to explain and guide me. Also the hammam was not switched on. 
The welness area is OK but locker rooms need to be refurbished. Also view is not really special. You just look on a plain grass level.

I wanted to book some activities but they were totally overpriced.

My stay at the Santani was not memorable and ended in tears. 

I would definitely not recommend this hotel as I have visited so many amazing places in Sri Lanka.","Biggest disappointment in Sri Lanka","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r964783165-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We acknowledge the facts around the PCR test and we could not deliver the PCR test at the resort as we normally do. (which is the normal practice)

However, it would be pertinent if we all have a bit more understanding in these extra-ordinary days for travel. There is no certainty when you are travelling these days with sudden onset of the variants, regulations, travel restrictions etc and we have to be prepared for few hiccups if its genuine. As it has happened, the test was scheduled but the whole team from the 3rd party lab that was operating the mobile testing unit had tested positive for Omicron and that is why they were not able to come to the resort. There were no other options but to go to the lab to get the tests done. Its not that we didn't want to work with you to get a better solution. However, as you have mentioned, we didn't even charge for the drive to Kandy.

I wanted to highlight few other facts from your review as well. 

1. We are located 34KM from Kandy and its about 1 hour to 1 hour 10 min drive. 
2. The road is in excellent condition and paved to highway standards all the way to the estate. Within the estate its paved as well.
3. There is no risky behaviour with drivers that is different to anywhere else in the island. Its the same drivers who drive tourist around the country. 
4. All mountain view rooms have a similar view. 

Thank you.

Starting with a few positive notes: the restaurant staff is attentive and has represented the best part of our stay. The food is yummy with a fixed menu and two choices per meal. The spa facility (free of charge) is nice and complementary free actives available. The pool area is nice and the view incredible at sunset. 

A few points for improvement are related to the branding of bungalows as Mountain View as the one we have been provided was facing a different view (less spectacular) for the same price. 

Negative points: while I have requested a PCR test on February 4th by email on top of various requests and forms shared to the Management (allergies, flight schedule) our PCR was not booked and the day prior to our travel we had to reach Kandy (3 hours return trip) as this or an early travel to Colombo were the only option put on the table. The management was totally dismissive of my complaint and while acknowledging the reception of a complaint email never responded or addressed the issue and request for compensation. This means that we have skipped all complementary free of charge activities to perform a PCR test booked almost a month before. The transfer fee to Kandy were then not charged by the hotel but this represents a min compensation and the lack of acknowledgment from management a breach in hospitality protocol considering the rating of the hotel. 

The facility is situated 1 hour and a half from Kandy. The road is bad and unsafe and drivers are often adopting risky behavior at turns. This shall be flagged in their website. 

All in all, the location so out of hand and the services provided do not justify a 5 star rating nor prices in Sri Lanka. I would suggest to skip your stay and invest money in other structure in Sri Lanka where we had exquisite stay for half the price and much more attentive management. Hospitality is also looking at challenges together with the client and find optimal solutions. Not closing a blind eye linked to positive ratings.","Disappointing stay and poor management","2022-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r829650899-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Firstly, we have to assume that you may have mixed up your Sri Lanka and Indonesia trip, as Nasi Goreng is not the National dish of Sri Lanka, but a very popular and very unhealthy street food item in Indonesia and Malaysia.   

We have been struggling as to how to respond to this review as it is factually incorrect with many contradictions and we are not even sure if you mixed up Santani with another resort you stayed at. We are very dissapointed when our guests have negative experiences at Santani, which is not the case as you can see from all the reviews. However, in this case, it seems you were either terribly mixed up or had ulterior motives.   

While you mention in your review that you were sick on the first day and that you did not like the design elements of the bungalows, you continued to stay at the resort and after enjoying everything Santani has to offer, you had asked for a refund. That does not make sense and if you did not understand the product and if it was not the luxury and healthy gastronomy you wanted, you could have checked out the next morning. 

Therefore, we are led to believe that you were trying to get a refund of your stay during the peak season.   It also baffles us as you were asking for very unhealthy street food from Indonesia and Malaysia that typically costs about $2 at a fine dining restaurant and thinking it’s the national food of Sri Lanka.   

As for some of the factually incorrect statements you have made, we want to clarify these details so that potential visitors are not deceived by your wrong statements.   

• The temperature at Santani, which is located in the Kandy region at an elevation of ~900M elevation never goes below 15 degrees and all beds are draped in thick duvets and extra blankets are provided in the wardrobe. We had full occupancy during the Christmas season and none of our guests had any issues related to this. Hot water bottles are also placed in the room on request.   

•	We have a full wardrobe with two closets for hanging garments and multiple drawers for folded garments. Below them are two compartments with rolling slides to keep 40KG bags. The wardrobe is also equiped with a mini fridge, a safe, laundry baskets, hangers, umbrellas etc that were all shown to any guests when checking in.   

• The open door toilet is a design concept that is part of our concept and anyone genuinely coming to Santani already knows about it. Its mentioned in all our external communications. However, no one can see the inside of the toilet from anywhere in the room and privacy is assured.   

•	In terms of the ‘lack of comfort’, we are not sure what you are referring to. We do not have items associated with traditional luxury such as TV’s and sound systems, but this is part of our concept, which is intelligent luxury and is appreciated much more by the discerning travellers.   

•	We assume that the lack of coverage you mentioned was in relation to wi-fi. We do not have wi-fi in public areas and that is communicated clearly prior to your visit. Limited wifi is one of Santani’s attractions and what our guests visit us for. We do however have wifi in the rooms, and have had no issues in relation to the speed of this.  

•	We serve a three course meal for lunch, that starts with bread and a dip, a salad or soup, a main course (fish or meat) and a desert. The dinner is four courses with an added appetizer. However, during the Christmas period, we had a five course dinner. All meals are personalised and adapted to our guests needs but within fine dining realm. We certainly do not serve unhealthy carb filled meals such as Nasi Gorang, and we do provide the option of authentic Sri Lankan meals as well as western cuisine.   

Unfortunately it seems you were trying to get three free nights at a property for luxury discerning travelers and you have clearly not been able to appreciate the same things that all our other guests travel across the world for. We certainly do not condone scams, and this clearly was an attempt to scam the property which did not work in your favour, so we believe that the title of the review is quite apt in the context of your intentions. 

We thank you for the great feedback about the massages, and it is one of the reasons that Santani is considered one of the best spas in the world.   

Warm regards,

Stayed 3 nights and had a nightmare and a big disappointment.
We wanted to spend the Christmas holidays in love while enjoying a quiet and relaxing. Unfortunately it was the opposite.
From the first night I got sick because the bungalows billed at 800 euros per night was all open even though the outside temperature was around 5 ° C.
The bungalows are of no comfort:
• No storage space
• The toilet without doors open on the room (it's very romantic especially when the room is very small)
• Lack of comfort
• Lack of coverage
From your room could admire a beautiful landscape, but nothing exceptional either. But it was especially the occasion to listen to the noises of the nature like the discussions, the flushing and the farts of the other customers ......
The meal was very disappointing.
There was no menu or card, which can be interesting. The hotel communicates a lot about their heathy gastronomy and their ability to adapt to our tastes. IT'S WRONG.
At lunchtime we were treated to a small salad and a tiny dessert, while in the evening they served us a 4-course menu! They refused to prepare the most popular dish in the country, Nasi Goreng, because they did not have the right spices. We had made this request in the morning for the evening ....
Orders are taken in the morning for noon, noon for the evening and the evening for the morning, nothing is ready at the last minute everything is warmed and it feels.

The spa is not very beautiful but the massages are exceptional.
We expressed our disappointment to the person who made our reservation the next morning. She told us the night before we left saying she could not pay us back and gave us totally ridiculous explanations!
Thanks to this experience I no longer accept to pay the entire stay in advance.","A SCAM","2018-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r653480223-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Jannik, 

Firstly, we are very sorry to hear that you had a disappointing stay, as it is certainly not in line with the standards that we have been keeping from the very inception. This is the first time we have had such feedback as you can see from the other reviews on TripAdvisor and we have over 96% great rating after over 2 years of operations. We are really surprised by your review specially as you never mentioned any of these apart from the lunch on the day of departure while you were staying with us. Therefore, we have initiated a thorough review of your stay and all possible corrective action are taken so these will not be repeated and we maintain our excellent service record as we have done in the past.  While we appreciate the constructive feedback provided, we feel further clarification is needed with some of these points. 

We are glad that you enjoyed the food and the view which are two of our key selling points. In general it seems you have visited us without understanding the product and what is offered. We understand and accept that Santani is not for all. We are not catering to the segment that is looking for standard indulgent luxury. We cater to the segment who has already experienced indulgences at the highest level and now seeking a higher form of luxury which we have delivered successfully and being recognised for it globally. 

Pricing : 

Our pricing is certainly in line or more expensive than some properties across Europe and that shouldn’t be a point of surprise. We have been consistently rated as one of the best spas / wellness retreats in the world, and therefore to be ‘even more expensive than one in Europe’ is a point that we are certainly willing to take and accept. Our reviews on all platforms are over 95% reflecting the quality of the product and service delivery. Also, please note that our prices includes the following for 2 people. 3 fine dining meals of Michelin quality, two 90 minute sessions of yoga and meditation, guided walks, use of steam, sauna, and thermal baths. Three meals itself for 2 people of Santani standard would cost close to $700 in any major city. 

Spa Inclusions : 

Since you were only staying for 4 nights, you were not on a wellness package, and therefore were not entitled to a full Ayurvedic consultation. Once again, although you may have expected it, our consultations are not included unless you are on a wellness package. Your reservation clearly indicated what was included and not and we do not even see a communication gap in this regard and we are at a loss why you were expecting some of these you have mentioned. Again note that the Ayurvedic Consultation is with a qualified doctor and lasts for 90 minutes. What we are charging is a fraction of what an hour and a half with a Doctor would cost in any Western Country. 

Sound from the temple

On some days, the local temple, which is located on the other side of the valley does engage in prayer activities in the morning. Almost  all of our guests find this very soothing and have specifically mentioned about the chanting in other reviews in such a positive way. While you may have considered disturbance in some way, this is part of being in a Sri Lankan village and in the wilderness, where the noise travels across the mountain. There is a cultural element involved here. There is a certain energy and emotion in the region, and the chanting from the local temple on occasion certainly adds to this level of authenticity. As you also know, we are a wellness focused resort that focuses on an Intelligent luxury that goes beyond the mundane amenities and standards. Waking up with the sun and aligning ourselves in to the primal rhythms of nature is one key elements of intelligent luxury as well as wellbeing. Its unfortunate, we were not able to provide you the peace that all our guests experience through the environment they are in.

Extra Lunch
If you had read through the booking confirmation, you would have noted that the you are on full board basis, which means that you are entitled to 3 meals per day. Given that you had lunch on day 1, you are entitled to all meals until breakfast on your day of checkout. We do accept the fact that this should have been informed to you earlier, so you would have time to adjust accordingly. All lunches at Santani are 3 course meals and include a soup, a main meal and a dessert. That was what was offered to on that day, and something that you had agreed to. However, that is something you had the ability to speak to our chef and change if you wanted something else. Regardless, you should have been informed earlier, and we do apologize for this miscommunication on our part.

Overall, while you have spent this amount of money at the resort and you have enjoyed the food, the views and the kind and friendly staff as per all the other positive reviews we have received, it is clear that your expectations were different to what we are and further reading on the inclusions would have cleared up any issues earlier. We have tried to contact you multiple times in order to speak to you directly, but have not been able to get through to you. 

If we are not mistaken, you were referred here by one of our past guests who stayed at the resort for 21 nights and is set to return in a few months again, and she truly enjoyed the resort and considered the entire staff as part of her family. 

It is unfortunate that you were not able to experience Santani positively and that you had opened a TripAdvisor account purely to write about this experience. We apologize for some of the shortcomings mentioned above, but we do hope that you will return to experience it in a different light than you did on this occasion.

Warm regards,

These past four days have been very interesting to us, unfortunately not in a good way. We are a couple who is used to traveling and which likes to explore different places. From high end to average places we enjoy exploring other cultures and accommodations. To come straight to the point: the price we invested into Santani-Resort is not acceptable!

For over 700 USD a night you at least expect some benefits like an ayurveda introduction or a well equipped spa. In fact one massage with a “discount” of 25% is even more expensive than getting one in Europe with the same Ayurveda-treatment. The staff is kind and friendly, unfortunately though not used to fulfill the needs of western expectations in in this price category. We haven’t been served our dinner at the same time once for the past four days due to the service. In addition to that the staff seemed to have a hard time to understand to bring us some plain tomatoes or avocado for our breakfast. Things we thought were basic seemed to be groundbreaking requests here. 

Besides that the food and the view from the resort were lovely. Western standards which meet the local cuisine.

The spa unfortunately was like the rooms: Disappointing! The spa-staff seemed mostly confused and not really knowing how to consult us when it comes to Ayurveda or basic massages. Also every guest is “welcome” to spend another 150$ per person to be consulted which treatment and which diet is appropriate for them. By spending over 700 USD a night you would at least expect these kind of “consultancies” being included in the price. 

The beds in the rooms are ok. The open toilet, the dark bathroom lighting and no air conditioning takes time getting used to though. Friends of us and ourselves haven’t been able to sleep through the night due to a temple which is close by and where loud noises and prayers come from every morning around 6. 

All in all we are leaving this place disappointed. The reason for us writing this review is due to our final experience at Santani where we have been told by the guest manager to receive a lunch before our departure which will be covered by the hotel. When we came to the restaurant to receive the lunch - one hour before leaving - exactly the same manager informed us that he will charge now 32$ for a meal (the meal would have included a soup and a quinoa salad). That is unacceptable! 

This place feels like a total rip off and by having spent more than 4000 USD for four nights, we definitely wont recommend it to anyone nor come here again.

We are truly sorry that Santani was not what you expected and the inconveniences caused. We are also baffled by your review, as all the items you have mentioned are in fact what all our guests like and what made us one of the most unique hotels of the world as selected by Forbes Magazine and one of the best spas/new hotels of the world as per numerous industry experts.  It is a clear mismatch of what you were looking for and the Santani concept rather than a substandard product or service. . We wish you had spent some time to understand the product and concept of Santani. Meaning reading some of the five and four star reviews that we have received which describes what Santani is all about. As you can see, these reviews comprise around 98% of our total ratings.

The distance to Kandy, not having air conditioning, open rooms, natural surroundings or being part of nature etc are all part of Santani’s attraction and are well discussed in all our external communications including our website as well as on our guest reviews on TripAdvisor and other online platforms. As you know, we have excellent ratings on all these platforms as well. 

I take this opportunity to further discuss Santani philosophy and uniqueness so anyone reading this will get a better understanding and we wont have mismatches such as this. Santani focuses on intelligent luxury as opposed to indulgent luxury that is generally the case in standard hotels. We cater to discerning guests who have already experienced material indulgences and are now seeking higher level of luxury that is also high in social, environmental, and community impact. The architectural design, wellness philosophy and service philosophy are all designed to first provide mental and physical relaxation of the highest level while also providing the best food, spa treatments, and service in Sri Lanka. We focus on minimizing stimulations to the mind that in turn slows down the mind and allow it to truly relax. A truly relaxed mind is the ultimate luxury in todays stressed world and is the most unaffordable luxury.  In addition to the clear lines and minimal design, this is achieved through the integration of nature (allowing you to harmonize with the natural rhythms), personalized fine dining cuisine that again harmonizes with your body types and needs, and spa treatments that are specially designed to alleviate mental and physical fatigue. 

Whilst noting our thoughts above, we extend our apologies for any inconvenience caused by this mismatch.

We are so sorry that you could not experience the same excellence that Santani is known for. As you mentioned, we have had many reviews and we have not had a single bad review. We have done a full review of your stay and have already taken some corrective action on certain areas. It seems you have missed most of our offerings such as free morning and evening yoga, excursions and use of the spa facilities given the less than 24 hour stay you had at Santani. 

I want to further explain some of our processes and offerings for the benefit of anyone reading and to make sure the expectations are set right.

As for the signage, we have over 15 sign boards in a 12 KM stretch since the turn off from the main road. Also, the road is paved and in excellent condition till the last turn off, which is only about a 1 KM estate road. (this part is also being paved currently) We communicate with the drivers throughout the arrival process and if any vehicle is finding it difficult to make the last 1 KM, we send a resort vehicle to the last turn off to pick them up. We ask for the contact number of the driver to facilitate this with every guest as part of our pre-arrival process.For some unfortunate reason, we did not receive a response from you after multiple requests to provide the number of the driver. 

The toilet is designed with the overall concept of openness and being one with nature.  Also, one of the key ethos of Santani is about being comfortable with ourselves and whoever we are with. However, no one in the room can see anyone sitting inside the toilet unless one purposely look in. We understand this may be an  unusualfeeling at the beginning of a stay but guests appreciate the conceptual significance as they settle in. 

You may have missed all the toiletries during your short stay but we have everything any hotel has from Shampoo, Conditioner, Bath Gel, Soap, Body Lotion, cotton pads, ear buds, etc. We also note that all of them are organic and natural locally sourced products of the highest quality and some of our guests buy these toiletries to take home. 

The fruit basket is designed to consume with your hands. However, we understand some guests may prefer to use cutlery and we will address it. Thank you for pointing that. 

In regard to the spa, we certainly try to be responsive to each guest’s request with the highest emphasis. However, by the time you had contacted the spa, it was really late. The team tried to rearrange some of the already scheduled appointments just to accommodate your request as we knew you had less than 24hrs with us. That’s why it took 20 minutes to get back to you. Unfortunately, we could not rearrange any of the scheduled appointments and we offered the first appointment the next day but we understand you did not take it as you were leaving early morning. 

We have taken note of the drinks and like to advise that we are already in the process of offering a wider variety of beverages. 

Again, we would like to kindly remind that throughout our external communications (as well as in most of TripAdvisor comments), we say that Santani is best experienced over a minimum of 3 nights. Relaxation and experiencing is a process and it is difficult to experience much and relax when a person  is in a rush. I sincerely hope you would come again and stay for about 3 days. We will certainly ensure your return will be worth it.This would also allow you to better experience Santani and its uniqueness. 

Again, we are really sorry about your experience and we have taken note of things to improve.

We also had a good dinner and the breakfast was really good! 

The rest of the experience was far away from good. Most roads in Sri Lanka aren’t the best, but the road to come to this place was the road to hell. There are no signs to the lobby so our poor driver took the wrong turn and we almost crashed our car. How can the hotel management not put any signage and/or staff to show people where to go! This is a disaster! 

Be aware that there is no door to the toilet in the room, so you won’t get any privacy whatsoever. 

This place I really minimalistic, with no toiletries besides soap, shampoo and some cotton pads. We got a really nice basket of fruit when we arrived but there was no cutlery to cut it.........

It’s also very quite, so if you are unlucky and get a loud neighbor it could disturb your relaxation time. 

We were told that we could access the spa, but in our attempt to book a massage, we had to call 3 times and wait 20 minutes for someone to get back to us. Just to say that  there were no available spots. 

The food that is served at the restaurant is great! The problem is that the range of drinks is very poor, they couldn’t even do basic drinks and when we asked for a second glass of sparkling wine they said that they had run out of it....

My final words would be that this place has a lot of potential, but is definitely over priced for what is offered to its clients. It has been running for over 1 year now but it seems like they opened just the other day. Can’t believe that they got so many good reviews from other past guests.

Greetings from Yara Galle Fort and thank you for your review. We believe what motivates you for this review could be that you may not be convinced that we agreed to refund you one night charge of the additional booking, even though we are not at fault. Refunding money won't take place overnight especially on an occasion like this and it is not easy to send money from Sri Lanka to another country especially during a crisis situation like we are suffering at present. If we have charged your credit card then it is just a matter of informing our banking partner to refund. Please accept our apology for any inconvenience caused to you.
However, with regard to your review we wish to state following;
1). You had reserved your room with a different online travel agent which we are not registered with or do business with. However, your booking came to us via another OTA which we do work with. There was a reservation for 2 Rooms under the same name and that was the very reason why I myself inquired from you whether there was anyone else joining you. Since you said no, we were under the impression that booking was for another guest as 2 reservations was made not on same date but on 2 different dates and both reservations were pre-paid.
2). I recall we clearly explained to you during our email conversations, both of these bookings were prepaid by the online agent which we got the booking from and since the hotel was full on 5th November we had to charge for the 2nd booking though there was no one who checked in.
3). As you requested, we were not in a position to refund you as we have not charged your card. We have collected the payment from the online travel agent’s Virtual card. Even if we refunded as you may know we have to pay the commission to the agent for the 2nd booking also as there was a valid booking. That was the reason why I wrote to you to inform you to contact your travel agent and request the refund. The agent could then request a refund from us. However there was no request to date either from your Online Travel Agent or  ours.
4). We believe if you would have informed your agent of this issue then and there right after you receive SMS from your bank indicating the charge on your credit card, this would have been easily avoided.
5). As you are well aware, if we were thieves and desperate for money as you claimed, we wouldn't be able to maintain good reviews on many online platforms and agree to refund you one night charge even though we lost our potential revenue.
We hope you will give us another opportunity to serve you at Yara Galle Fort.

Thank You

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are sincerely sorry to hear that your experience fell short of expectations, and we appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.

Firstly, we deeply regret any discomfort you experienced during your stay, particularly in relation to your room allocation and interactions with other guests. We understand how important a honeymoon trip is, and we sincerely apologise for the misunderstanding regarding the room type. Our records indicate that your reservation was part of a group booking consisting of two double and two twin rooms, as per the travel agent’s voucher. We were not informed that this was a honeymoon booking until your final day, at which point our Front Office Manager, Thushara, personally discussed the matter with you and shared the original booking details. We appreciate your understanding at that time and your acknowledgment that the room type was not a major concern compared to other matters.

With regard to the unfortunate incident involving a child near your balcony, we investigated the matter thoroughly. CCTV footage confirmed that a young child, part of a neighbouring family, briefly entered the garden area outside your room and tapped on your window around 8 a.m. Our team acted promptly upon receiving your complaint; the child's parents were immediately approached and expressed their sincere apologies. The family checked out the same day, and the father wished to personally apologise to you in the lobby, though we understand and respect your decision to decline the meeting.

We are truly sorry for any unease or distress this situation caused you and your wife. Please rest assured that guest safety and privacy remain a top priority for us, and we are reinforcing supervision in public areas to avoid such incidents in the future.

Regarding your dining experience, we acknowledge the concern about queue management and guest etiquette. While we cannot control individual behaviour, we fully agree that our restaurant team should be more proactive in such situations. We have already begun implementing enhanced training for our staff to better manage and support orderly service during peak meal times.

We are disappointed that your overall experience did not reflect the warmth and hospitality we aim to offer every guest. Your feedback has been shared across departments to ensure lessons are learned and improvements made.

We genuinely hope you will consider giving us another opportunity in the future to deliver the stay you rightfully expected and deserve.

Warm regards,
Team Amaya Hills

The third stop during our tour through Sri Lanka (7 in total). The property is pretty, the view of Kandy is wonderful. That’s about it.

In my opinion,  I would avoid this place at all costs. Certain guests here have a reputation for being intolerant of foreigners, and we felt it first hand here. A mother asking to cut in line to get her child’s omelette was just a guise to order for her whole table, which she was unhappy about (I didn’t get eggs that day). Lots of cutting lines during dinner, stealing of chairs and tables, etc. We were in constant anxiety during this stay.

Our final straw was our second morning, around 7am, we woke up to a 12 year old kid peering through our balcony door trying to get access to my room (room 56, garden view). My wife is beautiful and was clearly noticed the day before - was he trying to peep on her? Was he trying to break in and rob us? What if he gained access and I injured him defending ourselves? The hotel assured that there were not children in our vicinity, so how did that happen?

Hotel management complained about being unable to manage certain guests, and implied that these issues arise often. They apologized but said they couldn’t do anything about it. Where I’m from, peeping on someone is a crime. I am aware our tour company is looking into the matter and we have advised to pull this hotel from all future tours.

Oh and lastly, they gave us a room with two single beds for our honeymoon lol do better.

UPDATE: The hotel has been flagging this review to get it removed, but I'll just keep editing it so it remains.","There are many better options in the area","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12220047-d480276-r1008707744-Amaya_Hills_Kandy-Heerassagala_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The photos on Agoda were misleading. We booked a Premium Deluxe Room based on the advertised images showing a spacious room with a living area and sofas. However, the reality was far different—a tiny room with smelly beds and an old, worn-out feel. It was frustrating to pay $290 USD for something that wasn’t even worth $100 USD.

The service in the restaurant was just as disappointing. The staff seemed more interested in clearing tables than attending to guests. Even for water, we had to repeatedly call the servers. No one approached us to ask if we needed assistance or anything else.

We sincerely apologize for any discomfort you experienced during your stay at our hotel in Kandy. We take all guest feedback seriously, and we'd like to address your concerns.
 
Firstly, we understand that there may have been some confusion regarding the hotel's accommodation policies. Your reservation was made for two people on a Half Board (HB) basis, but it seems that five people, including children aged 16, 12, and 8, were part of your group. As per our hotel policies, children above the age of 12 are considered adults, and if children below 12 years share a room with their parents, a meal supplement is mandatory. Our team tried their best to accommodate your needs and requirements within the framework of these policies.
 
Regarding the delay in providing your room, we regret any inconvenience caused. We understand that waiting for 45 minutes after the check-in time is not an ideal start to your stay, and we will certainly review our check-in procedures to improve guest experiences in the future but due to the aforementioned confusion, an elaborate check-in process was required.
 
Concerning the cleanliness and maintenance of our property, we take these issues seriously. We will work to ensure that our rooms and common areas are well-maintained and free of any hygiene concerns. Your feedback about dead insects in the corridor is duly noted, and we will reinforce our cleaning procedures to prevent such issues in the future.
 
In terms of internet connectivity, we tried our best to provide a solution during your stay by offering in-room Wi-Fi, as the central Wi-Fi system was unable to function, owing to the multiple devices in one room. 
 
As for your request for four beds in a triple room, please understand that our hotel policies do not allow for more than three beds in a triple room. 
We regret any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding of these limitations.
 
We genuinely value your stay with us and always strive to prioritize our customers' comfort and satisfaction. While we understand that your experience may not have met your expectations, we hope this response clarifies our efforts to accommodate your group within our policies. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you encountered and look forward to serving you better in the future.
 
Thank you for your feedback, and we appreciate your understanding.

Warm regards, 
Management - Amaya Resorts & Spas

Things started badly with a very delayed and incomplete room service order, even though I made sure to clarify the order on the phone twice (because I suspected the room service staffer was not operating on all cylinders judging from the conversation). Although the kitchen and staff ultimately made good on this mishap by expediting the remaining order and offering complimentary beverages, it did spoil the arrival. Dinner later which was a buffet was also disappointing and whilst it was broad and there was a lot of it, there were also a lot of people clamouring around it. This property seems to be very popular with large groups and therefore be ready for a bit of an elbow fight around the meat section. Regrettably I lacked the Mandarin  politely to say, “excuse me kind madam, but there is a queue - we must all wait our turn for the lamb chops”. Tragically I suspect it may not have mattered in the slightest.  Final note on the catering: desserts at dinner were pretty bad, even the ones I was able to identify. Breakfast is very missable, though it’s an opportunity for a cup of tea viewing the hills.

Our room was palatial and had a great view from the balcony. But the fittings and furniture were as old as the hills that the property overlooks and the bathroom was the ultimate expression of this. Water was very hot though.

The best parts are: 1) the view which is pretty stunning, 2) the pool which looks over the landscape which is great not just because of the view but also because it’s really deep - 8ft at its deepest - which is not the case for many hotel pools and there’s a big shallow bit as well, and 3) the staff are generally very polite - if less capable in English than some of the staff we have encountered in other parts of Sri Lanka.

For a night, on the way to somewhere like Nuwara Eliya, it’s tolerable. But I suspect there are far better properties even for this purpose. Sadly, I’d have to say: avoid.

From the time we came, it just seemed like things were complicated.   We were initially told by reception that the only option we could really explore was paying $28  per day to go half board. We were not even told about the à la carte option.  The a la cart option also had additional fees. They don’t tell you that you have to pay an additional 18% on VAT, and then 10% on service charge.   Food took a long time to be prepared, and sometimes we were sat there for over 45 minutes waiting for food.   On the first day we were told that we could not have separate bills because it had already been through on the system  however when we address this with management, this was sorted in a professional way and they did offer for us to have 10% off the bill the next time we went  However, I thought that the damage had already been done. The lifeguard is very nice and helpful. In general, the staff are nice, but I feel like some staff  are not open and honest with you about the different options available.  I think this is the thing about bigger hotels, you don’t get the personal touch and a warmth and empathy that we experience in the rest of Sri Lanka.

I had high expectations when visiting Ahungalla Heritance (part of the Aitken Spence chain), but the food quality was a major disappointment. The lunch buffet was underwhelming, with most dishes lacking salt and flavor. The fried rice, made with samba rice, was a poor choice and didn’t complement the rest of the dishes at all.

Tea-time snacks were no better—minimal variety and nothing appetizing or memorable. We even raised our concerns with the chefs, but unfortunately, there was no noticeable improvement.

For a reputed hotel chain, the dining experience was far below standard. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on upgrading their food quality and variety.","Annual Day outing of YSIS..","2024-11","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r982574746-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The positives first. The restaurant staff and room cleaning staff were excellent.  The rooms are very nice, spacious and beds are extremely comfortable.

Unfortunately the reception staff and management were extremely unhelpful and didn’t address issues when highlighted.

We visited during Sri Lankan new year and we knew shops and restaurants would be closed, we asked the reception staff and were advised Fri and sat (which is what we expected) I also asked if they knew if restaurants in Galle would be open on the Sunday and was advised they would all be closed as still new year so better to stay at the hotel. This was incorrect as a discovered through a Facebook forum and visited Galle on the Sunday were all restaurants were open. This felt like an attempt to keep you in the hotel spending money.

The prices at the hotel were also questionable. The hotel we stayed in the week before had clear pricing on there menu  eg Nani goreng 1800 Sri Lankan rupees.  The heritance menu do 10% state service charge to be added, but also to be added is 18% vat meaning the prices stated which were already at least 20% higher than the previous 5star rated hotel we had stayed in were much more costly than other similarly rated hotels and more concerningly this isn’t clear.

The pools open at 8am which is fine as they need to clean them, but the bed cover and towels aren’t available until 8am and as I am an early riser and like to get up and spend some time in the sun before breakfast and the sun gets too hot this was disappointing. Also out of the 5 nights we stayed here I had to trek around the resort on 3 separate days to find a pool attendant as you can’t get the mattress and towels yourself, having gone to reception on 2 occasions it took until 9 am on 2 of the days to get the towels and mattresses, and all the manager Clive could do was apologise, which given it happened again the following morning was very poor. The issue clearly hadn’t been addressed. Also around the pool, wasn’t cleaned with cigarette ends (dissapointing that’s scruffy guests leave this is the first place) plastic bottles and beer caps left on the grass for the last 4 days we were there. 

I would not recommend this hotel to stay at and instead would highly recommend the 5 star Taj Bentota which is only 20 minutes away and is excellent with much more around the hotel as well which if you want to explore is great.","Very dissapointing stay here, wouldn’t stay here again.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r947054305-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Не любитель оставлять отзывы и в принципе лень этим заниматься , однако, после определенных нюансов , все же решил написать. Отдыхал с супругой с начала августа в этом отеле через туроператора ""Анекс Тур"". Начитавшись положительных отзывов и посмотрев красивые фото на букинге, приняли решение ехать в этот отель, без раздумий , даже не смущало , что не сезон и то, что со стороны где расположен отель, в это время большие волны.
В общем, начну с плюсов. 
А именно: отель находится среди пальм и множества деревьев по которым прыгают маленькие бурундучки и летают красивые птички , пляж очень большой и широкий , длина составляет около 3,5 км.,но убирается она только непосредственно перед самим отелем с утра из числа местных дружинников , которых по окончании работ фотографирует сотрудник местной полиции. Отель Хеританс 5 звёзд имеет: 2 бассейна , один маленький спорт зал, ресторан , один бар. Вот в принципе и всё из плюсов.) 
Не хочу в ваших глазах быть человеком-занудой, чтоб не думали :"" ну есть такие люди, которым вечно что-то не нравится."",так как сам так думал когда перед покупкой тура читал несколько подобных отзывов.  Приехав в отель, нас встретили девушки с белыми улыбками. Очень порадовало позитивное настроение персонала, всегда улыбается. Всегда. Но, как оказалось , что из выполнения своих профессиональных задач по поддержанию комфортного размещения клиента , это был единственный хорошо отработанный навык. 
Проще говоря , помимо того, что отелю больше 60-ти лет, его техническое состояние оставляет желать лучшего. Помимо запаха ""бабушкиного дивана на даче"" , никто не планирует освежать отель и следить за его чистотой, порядком в помещениях, номерах, мойке стекол и санитарной дезинфекции! 
В первый день как приехали , и зашли в номер , я обратил внимание, на то что слив в душевой забит и слив в туалете не работает достаточно хорошо, чтоб выполнить свою функцию. Спустившись в ресторан , я не являюсь человеком брезгливым и дотошным, я был не приятно удивлен что столы просто напросто липкие как в пельменной! Оконные стекла безууумно грязные и в зале летают мухи, которые садятся вам в тарелку. Супруга плакала, увидев это всё..настроение было ужасное. Ни разу, ни разу за все время не было на столе бумажных салфеток. перечница и солонка очень редко встречалась на столах. Но больше всего меня и других посетителей из Европы поразило то, что 95% блюд безумно острые! За пару дней до отъезда я не выдержал и попросил показать салаты и горячие блюда без ""карри"" и ""черного перца"". Ресторан я бы НИКОГДА не назвал рестораном. Встречают красиво, открывают двери , улыбаются, НО еда и обслуживание ниже плинтуса! После приема пищи нужно дожидаться , когда закроют чек, и расписываться в нулевом чеке , о том что ты не остался должен за напитки. Да да, даже если у вас ""всё включено"", даже если вы выпили колу или местный арак бесплатный. Чек несут очень долго. Много оставлял на чай, но все равно работать не хотят.
 С противоположной стороны , так называемого "" ресторана"" с мухами, липкими столами, грязными стеклами  находится бар. Где можно купить алкоголь , картошку фри и бургер. Большую часть времени питались там , там нет острой пищи совсем! В опцию "" всё включено"" входит вышеперечисленные позиции и алкогольные напитки местного разлива. Все что другое- платно. Работает пару часов до обеда и час после-на приготовление пищи.
Кстати, после 24.00  выпить колы , виски или курить пачку сигарет невозможно. Всё �� отеле закрыто. За пределами отеля магазины не работают после нуля часов. Из досуга возле бара с платными напитками есть зона где играет местный музыкант до 23.00. Возле выхода к океану постоянно дежурят местные торгаши и попрошайки . Их на территорию не пускают охранники , но они через сетчатый забор наблюдают за вами,когда пойдете купаться на пляж. Выглядит забавно, поскольку вы находитесь в 7-10 метрах на лежаках у бассейна в сторону океана , видите их, а они вас) они смотрят на вас, а вы на них) как в зоопарке , не ясно только кто зверёк. 
Персонал очень очень ленивый, кто бы что не писал , что они стараются. Это не правда. Пока на чай даёшь они делают вид. Ооочень медленные , ну очень. Ну и , конечно, не смог не обратить внимание на маникюр и педикюр персонала, это отдельная тема. Огромное желание было подарить маникюрные ножницы. 
Моё обращение и отзыв направлен , не для того , чтоб обхаять, а чтобы начальство приняло к сведению и сделало работу над ошибками. Потому что если вы себя оппозиционеруете как 5 звезд, то соответстуйте, будьте так любезны! А начальство научило только улыбаться и кланяться.

P.S.
В день отъезда, наш рейс переносили несколько раз. С раннего утра персонал отеля видел как мы сидели и ждали своего автобуса, но в 12.00 как сдали свои браслеты, мы стали людьми другого сорта. В 12.10 супруга попросила хостес 2 бесплатной бутылки воды с собой в аэропорт, что обычно приносят в номер, на что та ответила с улыбкой:"" а теперь это платно!"" Я был настолько поражён, что думал это шутка, так как на чай я только бурундучкам на чай не давал. 
В общем,  спасибо океану и прикольным бурундучкам, они нас не разочаровали.","Антисанитария, ужасная еда, старая постройка, пахнет бабушкиной старой мебелью","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r938513449-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for choosing to stay with us . As a responsible tourism establishment having successfully operated to  ensure customer service excellence and feedback for over five years , having gone through your review , it’s quite surprising to note some of the points you have mentioned which we wish to correct .

We do understand your experience and the subsequent feedback has resulted from the community event that took place on one of the days during your event.  Hence, as guest feedback and reviews are of utmost important we wish to to correct the points you have mentioned 

1. The event you have mentioned , is indeed a community event in a nearby town which was organized for the community of the Weerailwa and Tissamaharama area which may take place. once or twice a month as the most . As with many other areas in Sri Lanka , these are organized With the consent of the local council and we as a private entity need to respect the rights of the locals too to enjoy these activities. We wish to stress that this event and sound did not come from Hilton as their banquet hall is sound proof and enclosed and we have never had complains from our guests with regard to the same . Also the event ended at 11 pm not 4 am as you have mentioned 

2. The Management of the hotel are hotel professionals with over 2 decades of experience  in the hotel industry and our operations team comprise of equally experienced and professional staff who ensures to maintain the hotel with highest standards of facilities and service . We have continually operated the hotel retaining all our team even during the vivid pandemic and upgraded some of the facilities too to ensure the best service and facilities to the guests . This is very well reflected in all our other guest reviews and wish to correct your statement that the premises are neglected . 
Our tent is 470 square feet which is larger than most of the hotel rooms in Sri Lanka and all our levee have 72 x 78 inches king size beds with 12 inch mattresses for the utmost comfort of our guests and not queen beds as you have mentioned 

3. We are passionately engaged in promoting eco-tourism and conservation within our operations involving many eco - friendly practices and community collaboration in all our activities. Hence , we find it insulting that you have inappropriately mentioned that we use the term only as a marketing gimmick . If it was , given the lengthy review , you would have undoubtedly mentioned the non- Eco friendly practices of the hotel too 

Having said that , we do empathize with you for the inconvenience of the sound from the local community event on one of the days of your stay and hope we were able to make it up to you with the explanation and complimentary wine and accompaniments our Resident Manager offered  to you and family . 

Once again, we wish to state that we provide the utmost service and care to all our guests and will continue to do so in times to come 

Best Rgds

There are positive points here, but the negative aspects probably won’t be unique to us.

The property is owned by the same owners as the Peacock Beach Hotel. The feeling is very much “set it and forget it”, using the “eco” as more gimmick than ethos to lure in tourist dollars (plenty here that is not “eco”).

The positives: set on a stunning lake, looking out across the water to the mountains in the distance, the sounds of the birds and the wind in the trees is sublime. The pool is great. The tents are nice, with some issues. People have mentioned noise from the road but we didn’t find it objectionable. Most of the staff is charming, kind and concerned about the experience. We did 2 safaris, organised with Flamingo, both excellent. The Sri Lankan curry is fantastic, but the breakfast is forgettable, many other menu options unavailable.

Overall the property feels a bit neglected. The tent is quite small (queen beds not king), cramped and over stuffed with furniture. The electrical outlets on pillars don’t function.  One design flaw is the air con box, much too big for the space, is set right next to the bed with bright operating lights, it’s nearly impossible to sleep comfortably with it on or off. The floor fan doesn’t combat the humidity. Housekeeping was uneven and incomplete. There are plumbing and other sanitary issues. An item of value disappeared from our room. The massage was inappropriate in several ways, but one is not allowed to go into detail here.

An adjacent brand name hotel creates noise long into the night. We were informed by a formal card that there would be a “community event” that would impact our sleep. The Hilton event in question was loud partying and karaoke until 4am. The permanent nature of the card indicates that this a regular occurrence. I asked how often this happened was told “once a year”, but the name on the card was that of the previous manager who left ages ago, probably after reading the writing on the wall.  Insult to injury was the work that began at 6am with staff shovelling gravel into a wheelbarrow outside the tent right at our heads.

All in all poor value for the money. Sadly, we left feeling exhausted, but we sympathize with the kind staff, as they really are making do with a problematic situation mostly beyond their control.

Now we did not enjoy the service at all here. When you charge 280 USD a night you better also keep up with your service. The staff English level was really poor. No management team on the ground. They don't have proper receptionists as they are using the ""rangers"" to check guests in. The whole feeling is that they want to make the most money out of each guest. We spent 3 nights 4 days here. There's nothing around the hotel so basically all the meals were in house and activities as well. We did 2 days safari arranged by the hotel, which I do not recommend anyone doing so as the ""ranger"" with us barely spoke 10 sentences in 6 hours. Also limited by his English level and since he's done this 70+ times I expect some professionalism. I'm talking about 65usd per person for a half day safari (basically 3hrs finding animals). We really did not enjoy yala, had to wake up at 4:30 am arriving by the park to queue as there are 200+ Jeeps waiting outside. When someone spots a leopard 200 Jeeps rush to that spot and you have a traffic there... Really bad experience. Knowing our preference on quiet safaris the staff kept pushing us to do it (solely earning that money).

Breakfast option is way too limited and basically the same every day. I've requested for a local hopper (local pancake) breakfast 1 night in advance and was refused by the chef because he doesn't have time for it...
And the most ridiculous thing is that they provide free distilled water in the room but if you ask for water by the pool they charge you for the same free bottle selling it as mineral water.... 

There's a free 15min food massage provided to the guests but we only found this out the night before checking out.

There's definitely room for improvement but the owner better hire some proper management with foreign experience. Especially if you are opening a Hilton property next door.","REALLY NEED SERVICE IMPROVEMENT","2020-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r742788758-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

Our room had one large and one small step to the bathroom - totally unacceptable. On a positive note, we were moved to a larger room with a partial sea view. All rooms had showers over the bath. One room had a missing screen and broken hairdryer. Windows would not open and all had drafts. Aircon was freezing unless turned off. All rooms and corridors smelled musty. The foyer staff tried at every opportunity to sell us tours, taxis and jewellery shopping experiences. Apart from the lovely verandah bar area, the hotel was in a deplorable condition and I was embarrassed to take my friends there. Ten years ago, Galle Face Hotel was beautiful. So sad to see the disintegration.","So disappointed","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r998556134-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

It's sad how much this hotel has changed, this was my 3rd time at this hotel and quite frankly my last. They could provide some sort of loyalty preference option, giving better rooms for people whom have visited previously. 

A lot of people have moved or been replaced from working this hotel. I remember the old uncle with the white bowler hat whom would welcome you when you arrived at the hotel. He was a friendly and warm presence, sadly since his passing there isn't anyone that can fill his boots. The customer service has gone worse, I asked for an ocean view for our room, and got given a room overlooking the car park with the ocean. Pathetic excuse was they were fully booked, I booked my honeymoon a year ago so their excuse was nonsense. The food is still good, but nothing special now.

“Sri Lanka’s iconic landmark, The Galle Face Hotel, is situated in the heart of Colombo, along the seafront and facing the famous Galle Face Green. One of the oldest hotels east of the Suez, The Galle Face Hotel embraces its rich history and legendary traditions, utilizing them to create engaging, immersive experiences that resonate with old and new generations of travellers alike”

Sadly this old world charming hotel is in need of a new world face lift!

We booked a delux room - it was far from the delux tag given, we moved rooms to a better one albeit it was dirty and needed a further clean!

We ate in the A Lo Cubano restaurant which offers great sunset views and reasonable quality food - nothing too special but perfectly fine for our stay.

Breakfast was buffet style and disappointing, floors dirty, service areas dirty and food carts displaying more than just food - a good clean and some attention to detail would not go a miss.

Overall the hotel is in need of at the very least a deep clean and a robust approach to maintaining the first impressions of public areas or perhaps it’s now time for the owners to spend some money and make this hotel great again?

The irony - the pool bar is being refurbished- great news it’s just a pity you decided to do this in the height of the busy season so my last few hours in Sri Lanka were spent by the pool with the dulcet beat of a jack hammer and demolition work 😩

It’s clear from service that some of the staff lack training and customer care skills however many are helpful and try to do their best.

Finally, and it’s just an observation, I fully appreciate everyone has a different perspective of what good looks like and this is just mine however, reading the reviews, when a negative is written I can’t help notice the same day several positives are also written to counter balance the score - or perhaps just I’m overthinking this!","Old world charm lost!","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r994414690-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Durant notre séjour l'hôtel était continuellement en travaux : piscine, front de mer sans aucune compensation et cela pendant les fêtes de fin d'année.
Le service d'organisation des excursions est très cher et nous avons été mal conseillés.
Les restaurants sont bruyants,(DJ en fin de journée ) surtout celui de la piscine ou le gérant est désagréable et réserve toutes les tables pour une clientèle extérieure qui vient pour le coucher de soleil au détriment de la clientèle de l'hôtel qui est invité à rester debout au bar pour finir sa consommation.
Les repas sont souvent servis froid, une heure après la commande, service très long.

Despite our initial positive impression from their rooftop bar, our stay was marred by a series of disappointments.

We booked a deluxe room with a balcony, but upon arrival, we were informed that the room didn’t have the balcony. The hotel promised us a double upgrade for the final night, but this turned out to be an empty promise. The room we were eventually given was smaller and less appealing than our original room, with a tiny balcony that hardly met our expectations.

The issues didn’t stop there. The voucher we received for the rooftop bar was misleading. We were told we would get a free drink and a 10% discount, but when we tried to use it, the staff claimed that only the 10% discount was valid and refused to honor the free drink. The food and drinks we had were subpar, with poor quality and slow service. We were also not provided an itemized receipt for our bill, which led to confusion and frustration when we were charged inconsistently with what was promised.

The staff, particularly the head concierge Nikitha, were unhelpful and condescending. We were made to feel like an inconvenience rather than valued guests. After numerous attempts to resolve the issues, including an unacceptable bill and rude service, we were eventually offered a partial discount as compensation.

In summary, our stay was plagued with poor service, unfulfilled promises, and a lack of professionalism.

1st they said 45,500.LKR for 2days (see attached email as EVIDENCE!). after that, they said that price for per 1 night. We requested several times to speak to the hotel-manager, but he does NOT seem to work in the hotel, so we spoke with the manager on the receptionists Mobile-Phone!! So unprofessional!
The manager was just unfriendly, no excuse or anything, he insisted that we have to pay the Price per night and not as mentioned in THEIR Email for two nights!! He wanted 90.000 LKR instead of 45.000!!

Parallel we also checked prices on booking.com and also there it showed our price of 45.000 PER 2 nights (see screenshot from booking.com as Evidence!)

The managers answer was only that this would be booking.com prices and we have to pay double because we booked directly with the hotel!!!!

And the whole discussion on the receptionists private phone, with ZERO Kindness or respect from the manager, ZERO Offer or Help, Nothing!!!

The Grand Serendibs Staff and Manager just let us book another hotel!

The receptionists were also very welcoming. After spending an afternoon exploring Kandy we returned for a late afternoon swim and drinks. Despite offering a wide range of cocktails, they seemed to not have the alcohol required to make them. My wife must have requested three or four different cocktails which they were unable to make. 

After a freshen up we returned to the restaurant for dinner and this is where we were extremely disappointed. Our stay was expensive but we thought we would make the most of a fancy hotel and opting for something other than a Sri Lankan curry. We attempted to order the duck spring rolls and Australian strip loin steak for main but you guessed it, they didn’t have either. Never mind, we ordered salmon and tuna carpaccio and another type of steak. The fish in the carpaccio hadn’t fully defrosted and some were still frozen so that was sent back. Next was the pièce de résistance, the steak. In hindsight I have learnt not to order a particular meat in a country where it is not widely eaten. No steak knife was brought to the table, another sign of what was to come. I ordered medium/rare and the outside was as tough as a British expat’s skin who has spent the last twenty years in the Benidorm sun. After sawing through the poor thing I was met with a dilemma, do I try to call a vet to bring the poor thing back to life or make a complaint, I opted for the latter. The waiter tried to protest it had been correctly cooked. For our safety, we opted for some basic pasta which was okay. Given our misfortunes we were surprised not one person came to check how our (third time lucky) meal was. 

To their credit they did take the food off the bill. Such a shame, our room was comfy and you have spectacular views over Kandy but unfortunately bar and restaurant severely let the place down.","Al the gear, no idea…","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r910826979-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The room design is very outdated. There was only one usable power outlet, and you would need a long power cord to use it. Otherwise, you’ll have to keep your devices on the floor.

The pool attendant did not allow us to bring pool towels to our room. We were asked to leave the towels by the pool, so we had to walk back to our room shivering in the cold.

After that, when we went on a dinner at restaurant the capacity of the restaurant was too high and there was a long queue out side restaurant. all they are waiting for dinner. Just like a church queue.

There is only a mismanagement of the hotel, they cannot manage the amount of guests that come for dinner . They could have increased the restaurant area or allocated time for those groups. They have no desire or concern to do any of that.

Cons: 
1. The doorman made our luggage broken while unloading it from the car. (It’s a Rimova, but we can send it back to be repaired with fees after we finish this trip, so we didn’t ask for any compensation)

2. Monkey came in the room through the balcony and flipped our luggage, took away one bag of underwear. It was the housekeeping to be blamed, because we departed for day trip at 10 am that day, they did the housekeeping after we left, and when we came back to the room, we found it terrible, the balcony door was opened, our luggage was flipped out, sugar bags are opened and many ants are on the table, our herb medicine was opened as well, the monkey even tried some of these herb medicine, meanwhile, on the bed there was a nice note left by the housekeeping men, which is funny because it proved that this was not our bad.

3. Insufficient sincereness. Once after we checked in, I found the room in the lowest floor with hardly no views, I just asked the staff that if it was possible to change to a higher floor, the staff seemed to answer me immediately, even with no thinking: “no, this type of room you booked is only in 2nd floor”. I bought in at that time. But after the Monkey Accident, I requested to change a room, they led me to a 4-floor room, I found this new room was totally the same type( same size, same layouts) as the one I was offered in the first day, which made me feel upset because it shows the hotel's insincere attitude and service towards customers.

It's hard to think of anywhere else we've been in the world where the backdrop is as beautiful as it is here. When you first walk in and see the lake set against the mountains and jungle it really takes your breath away and has the wow factor.
Unfortunately, though, the hotel itself doesn't match up to its incredible surroundings. It's a real shame as it definitely has the potential to be something amazing but it requires an extensive refurb. 
Besides the fact that generally the furniture and common areas are very tired (the lifts in particular feel ancient!) the hotel generally feels very very bare. For example there are only about 12 sun beds in the main pool area, and there are no umbrellas or service in that area - despite boiling heat!
The other 2 pool areas feel even stranger, with just a couple of mismatched loungers sporadically dotted around. When you walk through the lobby you enter into an expansive empty space - if they added some nice furniture this could be a nice space for guests to relax too but there's nothing! The restaurants are also just a bit odd and empty. 
Whilst the refurb would obviously require a lot of time and money, just furnishing the areas better would surely be very easily achievable. We found ourselves wandering around the hotel not sure where to sit and what to do as there was just nowhere to chill and relax. Perhaps worth it as a one night stay only to see Sigrya rock and then leave as you don't want to be stuck here for too long. 
Check in is also advertised as being at 2pm but our suite wasn't ready at this time when we'd arrived after a very long flight.

Avoid food there. Avoid the whole area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My worst experience at a 5 star hotel!!
Where to begin… as we arrived we were quite impressed with the surroundings and the architecture of the building. Inside however nothing was maintained or updated - it was actually rather nasty! The hotel rooms are really old and dark. Not a place where you would like to spend any time or where you feel welcome or comfortable. Especially the bathroom really needs renovation. Throughout the hotel there also is no place where you could spend some time to sit or do something (like a comfortable lobby or beds in a spa area). As it was raining there was literally nothing to do in this place - also you couldn’t do anything outside. We asked for spa treatments but they didn’t have any available (for 3 days). It was very unprofessional. To the question of what we could do there we got the response: do you like pingpong?What a joke!! Besides the lack of amenities and activities the service was also really bad! We had an awful experience at the a la carte restaurant (also really the only option is to eat at the hotel as there are no restaurants in the area). We waited for more than 2 hours for our food. The food itself was not tasty and very disappointing. Definitely not even quality and appearance of a 3 star hotel with European prices. Later we found out that the same thing we ordered was just taken from the buffet (we saw it in the morning at the breakfast buffet). We were very upset and talked to the restaurant manager - where we got offered a 10% discount what we found ridiculous. Also outside of the restaurant the hotel was badly organised. Everything you ordered (very simple thing like a sandwich or  fruit) took always an hour to come (but mostly was not understood or they forgot about it). The staff overall l is not trained well. There needs to be a better manager (in the restaurant, reception, spa, etc). It was overall very unprofessional. When we wanted to express our disappointment and experiences to Dominic, nothing was done. No solutions, no suggestions on how to make our stay better, nothing. Dominic ultimately was very useless and didn’t fulfill his job as guest relations manager. Even after telling him that we want to leave a day early because of the hotel there was nothing done about that. I definitely don’t recommend staying at this hotel or coming there for dinner! The overall quality is awful - especially for the price and the 5 stars. Don’t trust the good reviews!! Don’t be fooled.","Terrible experience at Heritance Kandalama.

I went to Heritance Kandalama with my Husband, Son, and a friend in August. We were to meet couple of our friend there  for High Tea.

When I contacted the hotel and asked in advance, I was told  that we could walk in and no need to book for high tea.
So we walked in.
At the Reception I was told that if we were going to have high tea, we needed to have booked an hour in advance!

Since we didn't have time, as we were on our way to Kandy, we decided to have some snacks instead. We were told that we could go to the cafe from where we can order the snacks.

We were directed to the Bar area which didn't look like a cafe.

There were 6 of us and the tables were for 4 people. The Staff accommodated us by connecting 2 round tables together which wasn't good for 6 people to sit comfortably, as some didn't have the table space!
I tried to speak to a member of staff about this but they appeared to be busy greeting some guests who have just arrived,  offering them soft drinks.

We ordered these snacks:
'Crispy French Fries'- Believe me, they were not crispy but soggy! We paid Rs.5000 (about £12) for 2 portions! 
A portion of butter cake and a portion of fruit cake both together cost us almost Rs.5000 (£12) again. They were so dry my elderly guest couldn't eat it. I did try a piece and they were so dry as if they are stale.
We ordered Iced Coffee which was Rs.1450 but had a very slight taste of Coffee but it wasn't Iced Coffee!
My Son's Vanilla milkshake was almost Rs.2000 (£4)  it was as if he was having cold milk! Honestly, that's not the milk shake that is expect from a reputed hotel.
We had some Mutton Samosas and tea which were satisfactory.-No complaints there.
In fact, our food were never served together either. While some tried to have their dry cake, others had to wait for their soggy crisps.

We spent Rs.22,100 (approximately £53) for the snacks we had. I didn't expect to pay much less than that since it was a 5* hotel,  but I expected better quality and service. It was MY treat to my family and friends and I felt embarrassed beyond belief!

I'm very disappointed and feel let down and robbed a nice get-together with my friends.

I did contact the hotel but after enquiring me where I was based (Kandy, not where the hotel is) and how long I was going to be in Sri Lanka (we were to leave in 2 days) we were invited for either High Tea or Dinner, knowing that we would not be able to make it! 

Think twice if you are going there, you would be better off at a bakery!","Terrible Experience!","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r916199518-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

However, I must express my disappointment with the check-in process. Despite having paid the full price through online booking, it took an unexpectedly long time to complete the check-in procedures and reach our room. This was particularly frustrating considering the hotel's five-star rating. While two staff members were present at the front desk, they seemed preoccupied and did not attend to my family's needs promptly, even after obtaining photocopies of our local ID cards. Eventually, I had to approach another hotel staff member to inquire about the delay. After my follow-up, they accompanied me to the hotel lobby area where we were provided with refreshing drinks and wet towels.
Upon my arrival, there was only one other family waiting to check in. However, as the front desk staff took longer to assist me, more groups of guests arrived, making the front desk even busier. I observed the staff collecting signatures from guests who arrived after me, which surprised me as they seemed unconcerned about completing the check-in process for my family and me. The check-in time was 2 pm, and we arrived at around 4:30 pm, so the delay had nothing to do with room readiness and was solely due to the negligence of the front desk staff.
When I questioned why my family and I were being kept in the lobby without having our forms signed and being checked into our room, I pointed out that we had arrived earlier than the other groups. Finally, the staff arranged the necessary paperwork, obtained our signatures, and escorted us to our room. However, we then waited an additional 20 minutes for our luggage to arrive. Growing impatient, I contacted the front desk to remind them to send our luggage, and they promptly delivered it within five minutes. Unfortunately, these delays had a negative impact on my children, aged 15 and 10, who were eager to relax by the pool after their exhausting climb of the famous Sigiriya rock earlier in the day. If not for these setbacks, they would have had more time to enjoy the pool and make the most of our stay.
To add to our disappointment, when we finally made our way to the pool, there were no towels available. Once again, I had to request assistance from a pool attendant to provide us with fresh towels. These instances, coupled with other management issues throughout the hotel, gave the impression of a lack of proper guidance and organization. The only redeeming aspects were the pleasant natural surroundings and satisfactory food, although the variety was limited. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that the shops on the hotel premises were already closed by 9:30 am the following day.
Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this hotel to any traveler.

My husband and I just came back from a beautiful trip to Sri Lanka. We had a very hectic itinerary so we decided to put aside the last two days of the trip just for relaxation. We were looking forward for these last two days immensely as we got a room in one of the top 50 hotels in the world. We booked the luxury suite at a whopping high price of 324 dollars per night, so of course we were looking forward for a lavish and comfortable stay. 

“Name of hotel” is in the top 50 hotels of the world because of its architecture. It has been built in the middle of a cave without disrupting any of the existing nature surrounding it. My husband is a bird photographer and nature enthusiast so it was a dream come true for him. Full marks for the beautiful breath taking view however, when you pay such a large amount of money, you expect that level of treatment. 

To our disappointment, the stay was below average. There was absolutely nothing special about room or food or services. Their staff was not trained at all and no one had a clue about their responsibilities. Room was lacking basic facilities.  Buffet was a fish market and it’s not even tourist season right now. After paying so much we were expecting a variety of cuisines or choices. The chef was willing to cook anything we asked for but he didn’t have any knowledge about thai food, sushi (there were alot of Japanese customers there) or even tofu. 

Our worst nightmare happened at night when we returned to our room after a long and tiring day to find that the AC was not working. I thought “okay, let me open up the balcony and we can sit in the open air for a while”. Turns out that the huge, beautiful balcony they had given us could not even be opened because of the risk of monkeys and snakes in the jungle. Imagine you are tired and 3-4 male working in your room at 11 in the night when you were planning on unwinding for the day. The Duty manager came in, was on call with others , don't know as they were speaking in other language. For 1 hour they were trying to fix it and I was just sitting there, exhausted. I couldn’t even take a shower. Finally, at 12 in the night they offered to switch our room. The other room was just a small room with one bed which is not what we paid for at all. That night we decided to just stay in our room as It was the last night and we had an early checkout anyway.

The next morning we asked to speak to the main manager. We weren’t expecting anything back but I felt like I had to say something at least so that this same experience doesn’t happen to anyone else.  

Update : they have agreed to give us back 100 dollars which is nothing compared to what we paid. 

I am writing this so that if you are planning on staying here, don’t book the expensive room as the view is breathtaking from every corner of the hotel so don’t waste money on that. Just go with the basic room categories and enjoy!!

We had heard great things about this hotel, and were excited to visit…. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations.
The building is beautiful and the lake view - incredible. BUT, the hotel is old, the food is average and the decor non-existent.  You walk around a building with blank walls, and echoing corridors, to a restaurant with cold, boring, very average food.
For the price they charge, this is not worth it.

Firstly, I noticed that I was overcharged for the boat trip that I booked through the hotel. The amount billed was significantly higher than the quoted price, which led to some confusion and inconvenience. 

Additionally, I experienced a couple of maintenance-related issues in my room. The air conditioning unit would not turn off, causing the room to be uncomfortably cold and resulting in a restless night. Consequently, I was awake from 4 am and had difficulty getting the rest I needed. Furthermore, the locker in my room was not functioning properly, which made securing my belongings more challenging than it should have been.

These issues combined gave me the impression that the overall maintenance and hospitality at the hotel were somewhat subpar.

The bad is the rude owner who makes it clear guests are to fit in with his routine and not get in the way of his lifestyle ( just fund it) I'm aware that when other reviewers have complained about the behaviour and attitude of the owner he responds by attacking them in writing in a sneering aggressive manner while pointing out his positive reviews and I see from other reviews that he will accept no honest feedback and criticism of his behaviour. I ask you to judge how he reacts to this review in deciding whether you wish to stay with him. In reality staying at the Villa Rosa is staying with him in his home as he lives alongside the guests and requires them to eat meals, go to bed (wifi switched off at 10pm )to suit his routine  and as a guest you are made to feel uncomfortable and unwanted when his wife is swimming in the pool or they are enjoying a meal together in the restaurant. It is sort of like an awkward uncomfortable Air B and B set up living in his home. There is a large sign in your room about the tip box for the staff ( I always tip staff but it is necessary to have a large sign telling me how to behave) We had trouble finding the Villa, which is very hard to find in the dark and had to ring several times to try and get directions. We were greeted by the owner with ""`I hear you have been making a commotion, you have the smallest room I hope you  manage"". We did although the mini bathroom means there is not enough water for a hot shower and it runs out quickly. We were also made to feel our lateness meant we should eat dinner as quickly as possible and go to our room as it was lights out time. It was about 9pm. During our two day stay the owner made a point of ignoring us and talking to other guests, he makes his rounds at dinner, and when we were leaving and our driver was again having difficulties finding the villa to pick us up the Sri Lankan staff tried to help while waiting on the owner at lunch who ignored us despite us being paying guests,  as serving him was clearly the staff's priority. I could go on..I have not had to write a single other negative review from our three weeks travelling around Sri Lanka and am aware that the owner will attack me in writing for daring to be honest about his behaviour that many other reviewers have also commented on but in order for other travellers ( and a friend at Audley Travel that asked me to give an honest opinion in light of others complaining about the attitude of the owner ) I have been honest in this review","Fantastic Staff let down by rude owner","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r992310238-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

This accommodation unfortunately was one I did not like and wished I had not stayed in. 

The staff were lovely, however, no one spoke a lot of English so we had a massive language barrier. 

There were only around 4 mins of hot water a day in our room (we had the honeymoon suite) so we had to split it 2 mins each, which meant the bath on the terrace was unusable (unless you like cold baths). 

They advertise a tuk tuk service into the town for free on their website, when we asked for this they said they booked one, however then said they didn't understand what I was saying when I was referring back to the free service so we paid for this (it did not cost a lot, it was just the principle of the fact we didn't get what they said they would offer).  

The food was not amazing, we only had breakfast here but it was the worst place we had breakfast over the 10 different accommodations on this month-long trip we were doing. I had the Sri Lankan one morning and it was cold, I had to ask if they could heat it up. 

All in all, I would say stay in the town or find another place that takes you out of the city as there are a few places around :)

The welcome we received on arrival was short and indifferent, as if going through the motions and we had disturbed an afternoon sleep. 

Our room was not air conditioned and one toilet was to cater for 4 adults - not ideal. 

The positives are the views - outstanding- and the energy and enthusiasm of one, young employee. We rarely saw anyone else. 

The biggest issue we encountered was the bill on exiting.  We were charged 2300 LKR for a curry and 1000 for a Cheese & Tomato sandwich .... but then had a 10% Service and the previously unheard of 17% VAT charges added - making the curry nearly 3000SKR each.  The highest previously paid was 1100SKR.  This exceeds prices in the UK and whilst enjoyable was not the best we had in SL and way overpriced.  

Bizarrely my “invoice” was only hand written on Hotel letter headed paper - I would expect a formal printed  bill especially when VAT is involved?. We have not had VAT added to a single other bill, nor has it been referenced by any other business. 

Our departure elicited an even lower rated response than our arrival.  Nobody thanked us for staying at Villa Rosa and the Manager was quite happy to let us depart with no platitudes or good wishes or even a farewell wave.  Totally different to the welcomes, stays or departures from other, classier hotels we have experienced in SL.  

We left feeling unwanted and ripped off.  Based on this experience I cannot recommend Villa Rosa.","Hugely disappointing & a rip off","2018-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r590817783-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

To be fair, the location overlooking the river is beautiful but a bit far from Kandy, and the food is quite good. They also organized a good driver for a day trip, but I think most hotels in Sri Lanka can do that well. 

The hotel staff were also kind and helpful but the manager was extremely unpleasant (never actually met him but heard him shouting at his staff member who told him I was leaving early because of the room) and wanted to charge me for the extra night.

Well worth just wandering around.

The Villa Rosa is an oasis of calm at the top of an almost vertical climb up the hill overlooking the Mahawell River, the island’s longest.  We were welcomed by the German owner and shown around the hotel, which is quite small and informal, set within small, beautiful hibiscus gardens.  We were even shown around the kitchen and introduced to the chef.  

Each room has a private balcony or terrace and meals can be taken anywhere.  Our room was of medium size and to be frank rather tired looking, the mattress on the large bed was probably new when Sri Lanka gained it’s independence.  There was no comfortable chair to relax in and inadequate hanging/storage space.  The bathroom was adequate, but perhaps the towels and bath mat should be replaced.  The worst thing was the complete lack of privacy, the window looked out into the communal courtyard and the French doors, which opened onto the terrace (allegedly our private seating area), was in fact just a thru route for staff and guests alike. 

The Villa Rosa claims to be a premium boutique hotel….perhaps it was once, however charming staff and a great location do not compensate for worn and tired furniture and décor. There is a separate ayuvedic building but again this could do with revamping but cost of treatments were very reasonable.

The chef is very willing and although western food is offered,  beware it is served with a Sri Lankan twist … so no plain old grilled pork chops (despite a specific and detailed request for just that).  Sights to see are: Sigiriya Rock Fortress (beware of the ‘helpers’ who are very intrusive and my husband and I found the only way to get rid of them is to quite loudly say no – one helper actually asked us for money to go away).  The cultural show in Kandy town is so so but the tourist board really needs to put in more funding as it is quite amateurish.  Visitors can also go into the Temple of the Buddha’s Tooth but my husband and I felt as though we, as paying tourists, were intruding upon the genuine homage being paid by the Buddhist devotees there.

The fish curry was awful.
The chicken curry was terrible, it had only the drumsticks, that too wasn't cooked well! How come you put only one part from the chicken? It was like a combination of raw meat and chilli mixed water!
I'm pretty sure the Chef doesn't know how to make the chicken & fish curries!
Even at home, once you cook you taste before serving others, if you have a manager in the hotel his prime responsibility should be tasting the food before the function starts!

-You came to stay with us as a travel blogger - during this very high season at the hotel, we were kind enough to offer you our PENTHOUSE which usually goes for over US$ 350 on COMPLIMENTARY Bed and Breakfast basis, purely on the basis of you writing to me and asking if you can stay with us.  When you sent me the email looking for a complimentary room, I did not hesitate even to offer you our BEST room in the hotel for free of charge! We rarely give this as a complimentary room. Since we did not have any other best view rooms to offer you as we were full, instead of informing you that we are full, I thought of being kind enough to offer you both our PENTHOUSE COMPLIMENTARY with breakfast.  
-At check in, my guest relations manager who has been working with us for a while now checked you in and explained everything in the room. He has done multiple check ins at the hotel for many many months. He informed you as his usual check in procedure that ""Tea / Coffee / Water is only complimentary and here is also the mini bar with other items"" There would have been a misunderstanding to how you must have heard the alcohol is free. As in almost every hotel in the world, and I am sure you both travel extensively, they usually offer tea / coffee / water free and anything else there is a charge especially alcohol is never given free.
-Fruit Basket - we do not have fresh fruits cut as we know they lose their freshness,therefore we had only placed oranges uncut full with their skin!
-Regarding the vegan / lactose issue, I have spoken with my food servers and I taken the necessary action to let them understand that guest instructions must be clearly understood and passed on to the kitchen. Usually before a check in, guests have always written to me their special diet requirements which I have personally handled and spoken to kitchen. Thank you for this comment as for over ten years we have served many such cases and had no issue with serving as per request. 
As being a small boutique hotel with limited rooms, I always try to accommodate Travel Bloggers and promote them in my hotel and in Sri Lanka. We have worked with over hundreds of them through the past 3-4 years and to be honest, never had an issue faced by a SINGLE one of them.  It is a huge cost for us to host travel bloggers on complimentary basis, and also giving them our BEST and EXPENSIVE rooms for Instagram purposes. 
We took this chance to accommodate you both FREE to our PENTHOUSE which we have given very few travel bloggers. Your payment to hotel was just only on your extra meals and Mini Bar is never given complimentary in a hotel. Had we have also known, you were not happy with the food or there was an issue, immediately my manager would have looked into that and given that as well on complimentary! 
We respect the travel blogger market and have maintained such an amazing relationship with them and some have done more than promised by promoting us so much in the social media and among their friends and family. 
I am sorry that you both felt otherwise. I wish you both a wonderful year ahead and many Blessings!

However, once the moment of wonder from the viewing has passed, you then come onto the hotel itself and the service. We booked to stay here for 3 nights at the end of our couples retreat 2 week holiday to Sri-Lanka. As a treat we booked into the Presidential Sweet at a rate of c.300USD per night. Upon arrival things were good and all seemed as expected, however our initial impressions were soon proven wrong as we encountered a number of issues that quite frankly shouldn't even be present in a hotel that markets itself in the premium luxury range as Theva Residency does. To keep things simple here are the issues we encountered:

Breakfast - The breakfast each day was Al la Carte, which is not unusual but to our horror when ordering we were told by the staff that guests were only allowed to have 1 item from the breakfast menu. Why 1 item only I asked, after-all we had booked into a premium luxury hill side hotel - this wasn't your average Premier Inn (for those of you in the UK will know) so surely there should be multiple items available to the guests - ""No sir our policy is one item per guest only"".
Ok, not the end of the world we thought, fine, please can we have a Caffe Latte and Cappuccino also. ""Yes Sir, these are chargeable at £2.50 (3.5 USD) each"". How does a hotel in Sri-Lanka justify charging more for a Latte than the worlds largest leading chains such as Starbucks or Costa... ? 

Ok, enough about the breakfast. Other issues we had:

> Staff Washing their hands in the Pool in the morning - Acceptable? 
> Staff Meeting held at the restaurant (c10 people) standing alongside guests whilst eating - Surprised we weren't charged for the privilege to watch this? 
> The General Manager citing ""That's our policy sir"" when addressing the issues raised to him.
> I contacted the hotel in advance to understand if they could provide our driver / guide with accommodation, which is standard practice in Sri-Lanka as your guide / driver travels with you. For Info our 3 other hotels all replied to my email question on this topic and all provided accommodation and food. Surprise Surprise - Theva Residency DID NOT! So after a 6 hour drive up from the south of the island, arriving at 8.30pm to be told about this, we then had to send our driver off to find his own accommodation - Great Customer Service! 

Now, I am not one to moan for nothing, but I do expect Premium Upper Range Hotels to treat their guests with respect, address their concerns quickly when raised (as i raised multiple times) and not scrimp on quality when the room rate is 200 - 300 USD per night (and this was the out of season rate). The rooms require modernising as they are dated and a little bare inside - some decoration and homely items would have gone a long way. 

Needless to say, after staying 1 out of 3 nights booked, we checked out and ventured 10 minutes down the road and booked into a beautiful Suite in the OZO hotel. Not a single issue to report at this newly booked hotel and my Trip Advisor Review will reflect that. Oh and the room rate was less than half the price of Theva and the hotel had buffet breakfast, a rooftop bar with hillside views and did NOT include complimentary hand washing in the pool by the staff...","So much potential - Prime Location - but very disappointing - Poor Customer Service","2018-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r584264626-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Nothing about this establishment was 5 star (save for the price). The room- sparsely furnished- was falling apart. Our air conditioner was broken, and upon reporting this to the staff no one came to fix it. When we tried to roll up the window shade to get some air into the room, the handle to roll it up promptly fell out of the wall. The bathroom amenities consisted of re-usable bottles of shampoo and body wash (no conditioner) that were slimy when we touched them upon arrival.

As tap water is not safe to drink in Sri Lanka, the other 4- and 5-star properties we stayed at in Dambulla/Sigiriya and Colombo provided ample bottled water to the guests. The Theva Residency gives you two small bottles for the room for two people, and claims to be ""out"" of the large bottle on their restaurant menu. They will ""give"" you more bottles- that they charge you for, add tax and 10% service charge unannounced until checkout. So if you want to spend more than an hour a day at this hotel, bring your own bottles to avoid being charged through the nose. Suffice it to say that being charged an extra 10% for the courtesy of being handed a bottle of water seemed absurd to this traveler.

When we raised these issues to the General Manager at checkout, he offered no apology nor any credit to the bill. 

The only redeeming part of the stay here was the Sri Lankan breakfast, which was delicious, and our server at the restaurant, who was very courteous and pleasant.

We clearly mentioned that Theva does not have driver’s quarters, but we always offer alternative accommodation in a nearby guest house. This is the case in many of the Boutique hotels around sri lanka. Due to limited property space and privacy of guests, we are unable to have such accommodation.  
All our Juices are made from freshly squeezed fruits and we do not add any artificial cordials!

I am quite shocked at your experience with us as as we have been performing well and had many guest staying with us during the season who enjoyed every single aspect of the hotel. Let me adrees each point you have made:
1. Regarding the design - I am appalled at your comments as we have had interior designer (well known designers from London and India and Sri Lanka who stayed with us and informed that are hotel has a fabulous look! The dining area is so spacious with an outdoor sitting area to enjoy the view and most guest when entering the hotel from there has only one word to say and it is usually ""wow what an amazing location"" I must say you are the first person to make such comments about it being a glass box. It is far from being cramped and has a very spacious outdoor sitting area...
2. We have a small but a rare collection of jewellery which we always show to each guest in case they would like to purchase something different to take with them...we do not force you or beg you to buy anything.  We have had many guests who have bought so much stuff from the very little box of gifts we have.  we sell a few items to assist our local suppliers to earn some living and it is at your interest to purchase or not...Our managers are trained to let you know everything that we provide so that it assist you in ever need you might have. Once again I am shocked and this is the first time we have got such a complaint!!!
3. EVERY SINGLE ROOM has a mountain view...we do not have one room that has a bad view...we have never been told that we have a bad view...I do not understand such a complaint..some rooms have smaller window but every room has a fabulous view...If you were not happy at that point we would have been very happy to change your room and given you a free upgrade as we practice to always make our guest happy.
4. Unfortunately all over sri lanka there were heavy floods and extremely strong rains continuous for hours of a day..most areas around kandy were flooded and houses were damaged...we were thankful and lucky enough that we did not get that affected but it is difficult to control the dampness as the rains were very severe. Once again we did apologise for the dampness that we were experiencing which was beyond our control. But we did do our very best to assist in every manner to which most guests during that time commended us for.
5.  We give very fair rates to guests depending on where you are headed. We have NEVER got complaints or cheated our clients.  We accommodate ever need and charge fairly.

It should have been called Thieves-in-Residence….

What it has going for it: 
1.	Periodic stunning views. 
2.	A mostly charming, helpful staff

What it has going against it: 

1.	Despite the pictures showing what appears to be a glass box, much of the public interior space manages to be cramped, gloomy, dank and depressing—not unlike a badly designed office cafeteria. 
2.	Before we even got to our room, the staff stopped at the gift shop to show off local handicrafts for sale. 
3.	The first room we were given had no view at all, it was really a glorified broom closet with a sponge for a mattress and a balcony. At $345 for high season, a real window would be nice. 
4.	When we asked for a better mattress, we got both that and a view, as well as abstract swirls of black mold creeping across the ceiling. (They did apologize for the mold.) 
5.	This place sits up a steep, winding, unlit road from town, so a car ride at night is mandatory, even if it is just 10 minutes away.  It was raining and late when we arrived, so made the mistake of not asking the price for the round-trip when we asked the front desk to get us a taxi. The driver had the temerity to charge $40.

Before arriving in Kandy, I had visions of a kind of verdant,  romantic hill town. It is more a dense, heaving urban center, with some charming old buildings lost amidst the general hubbub. If I had to do it over again, I would stay closer to the historical attractions I wanted to visit, skipping Kandy altogether, and certainly skipping Thieves-in-Residence.","They should have called it ""Thieves-in-residence""","2014-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r248013078-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

First we got a call from you requiring for a room at Theva. My manager informed you very politely that we do have rooms and if you wish you can come to our hotel to stay the night.  Rates were not asked or discussed at this point.  Then you proceeded to come here with my manager continuously assisting you by giving directions to hotel. On arrival as we do with any guests, we offered a complimentary welcome drink and gave you the opportunity to sit at the lobby while we discuss the room arrangement.  You has not booked a room and my manager showed all the available rooms for you to decide whichever one you like.  You then decided on a deluxe room which is room number 12 but as these rooms are ONLY for two persons, my manager kindly informed you that we cannot accommodate 3 people in a deluxe room.  In fact we were nice enough to offer a FREE upgrade to a Superior room which can accommodate for 3 people. But you were adamant and rude to them and insisted that you are given this room even with a  mattress on the floor!! This is a boutique hotel which caters to high end clients and putting mattress on the floors as per a guest house would not be our way of doing business!  You continued to argue even after we have made it VERY clear that it is not possible.  You were also a walk in client and rates for that type of client is very different to offers that take place on line via agoda and other booking engines. But you argued for YOUR rate and expected us to give the rate you wanted for three people in a room which could NOT accommodate that many!!! It was very frustrating to my managers who for five years have successfully run the hotel and won awards for their service excellence.  In fact, Abey has been one of my shining employees who have been incredible with the guests and many recommendations for his service have been given to me.  Travelers are aware hotels do not let three adults share one bed and pay what they want!! We have rates set by the hotel and if you are not satisfied by it, then you should have chosen a hotel that was cheap and would accommodate a mattress on the floor! After being this kind and patient by offering a much lower rate and free upgrade in a room which we can put an extra bed, you still were arguing and being rude! We do not have drivers accommodation as it is the case in MANY boutique villas all over the world and sri lanka!  We do not expect drivers to park the car and sleep as we protect out clients and their privacy.  We were kind enough to offer a nearby place where he could have stayed for a special rate. Once again you got angry and was shouting at my manager.  You then  also requested that if you were to take that guest house, that Theva raises a invoice from our system (which would be unethical and forgery) for the driver's stay form another hotel!! If you did not like our policies, then you should have left to go to a bigger hotel which could have accommodated that.  You were aware of our policies as we have the hotel on a website.  You kept on asking our management to do things that were against any boutique hotel policy and standards.  Obviously you are not happy with boutique hotel policies and procedures and not seem to understand the concept of triple rooms.  We have been operating for five years successfully winning many awards and our main reason for that being the staff.

It is one of those places that was designed for other purposes than for a place for people to sleep comfortably. 

Our travel agents are to blame for this reservation, as they could not secure a booking in the hotel we wanted. However, this place was a disaster: forget the concept of sleeping, as the restaurant (with a terrace so that the noise is higher) is strategically located right underneath your room! Add to this the fact that the windows in your room must be certified as the thinnest and less noise reducing materials on planet Earth and the result is that you will not be able to sleep until the restaurant shuts down. 

The restaurant food is substandard: the starters were minimal and unbalanced, the mains were reasonable and the kids' menu was filled with spicy food (and we specifically asked for non-spicy food) that will make your kids stop eating right away. 

The penthouse suite is an act of terrible marketing: the only thing I give it credit for is for the beautiful views of Kandy, but the room itself is not cleaned properly and the bed is extremely uncomfortable, as the management decided to cut corners by putting a set of solid wood boards (maybe doors?) as your bed base, in order to guarantee a night filled with noises and cracking sounds the minute you so much move a toe.

Many things that hurt my heart happened at the hotel and nothing happened as we discussed the event with them. We had agreed to have breakfast and lunch according to their very expensive wedding menu card, but we had to face many unpleasant incidents that we have not faced in any other hotel. This was just a business for them and it was one of the most important days of my life for me, but they did not care about it at all. I will list the lies and deceptions they committed against me as follows.

1. When we arrived at the banquet hall, the welcome drink was also served and it was completely uncool at that time.

2. Many guests were unable to have breakfast because the breakfast was removed without informing us.

3. Not preparing the wedding table for opening, which is a major ritual on the wedding day.

4. Serving fewer plates than requested for the dinner table (after informing them of this, they returned the reduced number of plates).

5. Our valuables were missing from the room they gave us.

6. While the bride and groom were eating, the curtains on both sides were not opened as promised, and therefore it was not possible to provide a beautiful view from outside.

7. Not taking any notice of the fact that we had informed them that there was a special guest at the wedding party

8. At the end of the ceremony, they prepared a bill for the items we had purchased, including beer, but did not provide any of the leftover cashew nuts and other snacks that we had provided.

In addition to the above, there were many other shortcomings and mistakes in my ceremony and I informed the management (Rasanga) of the Araliya Hotel. But till date there has been no response and they are stating that they are looking into it. If you are also planning to hold your daughter's or son's wedding at the Araliya Hotel, I request you to think twice and not just once.","Araliya Hotel is the worst wedding venue in the Southern Province","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d23262280-r1008576346-Araliya_Beach_Resort_Spa-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Warm greetings from Araliya Beach Resort and Spa Unawatuna!

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your feedback. We would like to clarify a few matters related to your departure and subsequent experience.

On the day of your check-out, you informed our concierge that you would be leaving your luggage at the hotel for later collection, though no specific pick-up time was mentioned. As a standard protocol, your luggage was securely stored in the lobby under constant CCTV surveillance, ensuring its complete safety.

Later that evening, we understand that you returned to the hotel and attempted to re-enter the room that had already been vacated. Please note that once a room is officially checked out, it is released for cleaning and reassignment, and unfortunately, we are unable to provide access again—especially after an extended period of approximately eight hours. In line with our standard guest services, we did offer you access to our beach club’s shower area, which had been previously communicated as part of our departure facilities.

Our restaurant team regularly checks in with guests to ensure satisfaction. Had we been made aware that the variety of food options did not meet your expectations, we would have been more than happy to accommodate your preferences and offer alternatives to suit your taste.

Lastly, we were quite surprised and disappointed to hear your comments about the professionalism of our staff. Our team is committed to maintaining a high standard of service and conduct. In reviewing this particular situation, we respectfully believe that a mutual sense of professionalism from both staff and guests contributes to a more respectful and pleasant environment for everyone.

Обслуживание плохое, менеджеры невнимательны к гостям, и в целом создается ощущение полного отсутствия заботы.

Завтрак скудный, а если что-то заканчивается, персонал просто не удосуживается это пополнить, вероятно, по указанию руководства, которое совершенно не заботится о потребностях гостей.

Our stay at the Araliya Hotel was a particularly disappointing experience. We were given a room without air conditioning for three days, and the management refused to address this or offer any compensation. The service is poor, the managers are not attentive to the guests, and the general feeling is of complete lack of care.

The breakfast is poor, and if something runs out – the staff simply does not bother to refill it, probably under the direction of a management completely disconnected from the needs of the guests.

Don’t let the tempting photos fool you – in reality this is a hotel that disrespects its guests. In addition, the prices at the beach and pool are exorbitant compared to the nearby stalls.

We have thoroughly reviewed your complaint and feel it is important to clarify certain points. The hotel went above and beyond to ensure your stay was enjoyable by offering a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 9th floor, with free access to our infinity pool and a stunning direct sea view.

Furthermore, as per our hotel policy, payments are collected upon arrival. Despite multiple attempts to charge the credit cards you provided, all of them were unsuccessful. We want to stress that this issue was not due to any error on our part.

It is also important to address your comments regarding discrimination. We pride ourselves on treating every guest with the utmost respect and equality, regardless of nationality. At Araliya Beach Resort, all our guests receive the same high standard of service, and we do not condone any form of bias.

We trust this clarifies the situation. 

Additionally, we would like to assure you that we treat all our guests equally, regardless of nationality. We believe in providing every guest with the same level of service and respect.

No details were give from the reception. Then I placed ordered through room service which took one and half hours to deliver the cold food. It's shame that having such incredible hotel with a poor service.  It seems Management is incapable of delivering standard 05star service for the guest.

We have a lot of gear and small items and to pack everything and unpack with 4 dives a day isn’t feasible and the reception was very rude when I called him to inquire about how this issue happened. Comes next day we go back to the room at 3 pm after two dives to find that our room hasn’t been cleaned. After another 2 dives we come back and there is no water. We get split up and we realize they have only given us one card. Food has a huge variety but no quality.

Отель подтвердил бронь моментально. За неделю до вылета пришло от тур.оператора сообщение, что из 9 дней забронированных отель сможет принять нас только на 6!!! А 3 дня мы должны пожить в Radisson Blu Galle - якобы отель аналогичного уровня, да и потом на оставшиеся 6 дней Araliya повысить категорию номера до Horizont (с 9 по 11 этаж и доступ к бассейну на 12 этаже). Если мы не соглашаемся, тур.оператор может вернуть деньги. Но мы же понимаем, что за неделю до начала отдыха (а это были предновогодние и постновогодние дни) за такую сумму мы явно уже ничего не купим, да и отпуск уже спланирован. В итоге нам пришлось согласиться, ну отель же будет аналогичного уровня. :-)) Как потом выяснилось, нас таких ""счастливцев"" было человек 20 - все, кто полетел через Fun Sun- все были отправлены сначала в Radisson. А те, кто летел через Anex - из заселили с первого дня в забронированный отель.
Перелет был из Екатеринбурга - все вовремя, без задержек, летели 7 часов! На этом все приятности закончились. По приезду повезли нас на 3 дня в Radisson, заселение было ужасное, на побережье отеля волны, с которыми купаться просто не возможно. За 3 дня мы даже ни разу не смогли искупаться из-за сильнейших волн. И да, по питанию, сервису, ни по каким другим параметрам, отель не является аналогом. 
Вообщем, наступил день Х, когда нас должны были переселить наконец-то в Araliya. Трансфер между отелями за час довез до отеля (хотя ехать минут 15) - и на ресепшен нашу группу встречают сообщением, что номеров в отеле НЕТ! Как нет? Мы же забронировали, отель подтвердил, гарантировал, что по истечении трех дней все будет ОК.
А вот нет, в отеле якобы проходила свадьба и номера отдали гостям со свадьбы! Как со свадьбы??? А то, что мы их оплатили заранее - всем плевать. Получается, отель одни и те же номера продал два раза!!! 
Было предложено временно на 1 день заселиться в спорт.зал отеля, кому-то в помещениях прачечной, других хоз.комнатах... Нашей семье ""повезло"" больше всех - вместо двух номеров нам предложили один большой номер на 12 техническом этаже, со словами ""это лучший номер, с видом на море!!"" Нас планировали в этом номере, похоже, заселить на весь наш оставшийся отдых. Когда я пошла возмущаться на ресепшен - нам опять сказали, номеров нет, ждите завтра. Как выяснилось позднее, среди тех вариантов, которые были предложены отелем для размещения ребят из нашей перекочевавшей группы, действительно, это был лучший номер :-))Звонки тур.оператору Fun Sun и представителю отеля результат дали только поздно вечером. Представитель все-таки приехал и со страшим администратором отеля со скандалом пообещали конкретные номера, но только завтра!
Некоторые ребята из группы были вынуждены заселиться в подсобные помещения, кто-то так и остался ночевать в лобби!!!!
На следующий день, нас всех все-таки расселили по нормальным номерам. Нашей семье дали номера на 8 этаже (что не является обещанным уровнем Horizont, хотя доступ в бассейн дали). Тем, кто приезжал по системе ""завтрак"" компенсировали сложившуюся ситуацию системой ""завтрак, обед, ужин"", а так как у нас уже было ""все включено"" - нам предоставили опять-таки, с боем 3 массажа в spa при отеле.

Свадьбу, на которую ссылалась администрация отеля так никто и не видел! Да и приезжающих гостей из Саудовской Аравии заселяли тоже сразу!

Познакомились со многими парами, которые уже отдыхали в отеле не первый день - они прошли через такие же сюрпризы. Кого-то в первый день на ресепшене разворачивали и с оговоркой ""мест нет"" отправляли в тот же Radisson. Мы сделали вывод, что такие ситуации систематические у Araliya особенно с теми туристами, которые летают через Fun Sun и Coral Travel.

Теперь о самом отеле: номера все выходят на море, на 12 этаже работает бассейн с видом тоже на море. В номерах уборка на 4. Есть шампунь, зуб.щетка, кондиционер, гель для душа, бритвенные принадлежности, тапки, халат. 
В отеле два ресторана, при большом потоке людей - работают оба на завтрак и ужин. Вечерами в лобби поет девушка на русском, во время ужина в ресторане поют местные русские песни. Вообще отель на 85% заселен русскими.
По системе ""все включено"" в барах есть специальное меню на коктейли и напитки (выбор очень скромный). Бар на самом пляже работает только за деньги!
Есть вай-фай, работает плоховато на территории, картинки грузит долго. В номерах - связь отличная.

Питание: хорошее, всегда есть курица, рыба, морепродукты (краб, креветки), какие-то блюда с чили, какие-то -нет. Фрукты - арбуз, ананас, папайя, бананы, один раз давали маракуйю (очень кислая) и личи. Для детей есть мороженое. Обслуживание - это что-то. Не дождаться напитков, приходилось повторять заказ по несколько раз и вылавливать еще потом, чтобы тебе этот заказ принесли. Столы убирали тоже медленно, приходилось также вылав��ивать кого-нибудь и просить подготовить стол.

Пляж: песок, шезлонги стоят в тени пальм. К 7 утрам шезлонги семейные на платформе уже все заняты полотенцами. На пляже есть от отела ""смотрящий"" - в последние дни он помогал найти свободные места и занятые полотенцами шезлонги просто освобождал. И делал правильно! Не понимаю вообще людей, которые занимают места и сами при этом не лежат вообще. Получается ни себе, ни людям! В первые дни отдыха народу было, как в Анапе, к 09 января часть улетели и стало посвободнее.
Рядом с пляжем дайвинг-центр, снорклинг стоит час 20$. Муж ездил - видел черепаху, мелких рыбок, звезду, морского ежа. Ничего особенного и интересного больше не было.
Каждый день в 12.00 на берегу разделывают свежего тунца. Можно купить сашими, тар-тар или пожарить, цена единая на любое блюдо - 2500 рупий (примерно 800 руб.) Очень вкусно!!!

Море само не очень чистое - временами была масляная пленка от лодок, которые стоят ту же. Чуть правее стекает канализация :-) Многие ходили купаться левее - почище и народу поменьше. Волн нет, для детей идеально.
Солнце очень жгучее, за 30 минут можно сгореть легко. Не советую мазаться spf меньше, чем +30 или +50

Анимация: у главного бассейна каждое утро в 10.00 аквааэробика, вечерами в лобби живая музыка, в ресторанах - тоже живая музыка. Для детей есть детский игровой клуб, но мы туда ни разу не ходили. В баре перед бассейном тоже иногда танцуют или проводят дискотеку.

Вокруг отеля много ресторанов, магазинчиков. Торгуйтесь со всеми! Особенно с тук-тук. От отеля цену называют 800-1000, выторговывали до 500-600 рупий. Если идти от отеля направо и до пересечения с главной улицей, есть магазин Tea Zone Ceylon - хорошие цены на чай и огроменный выбор!

Во время отдыха ездили на серфинг - пляж Девата бич (тук-тук 600 рупий). Волны небольшие, для новичков самое то! Впечатления непередаваемые!Не стали заморачиваться с поиском инструктора, цена часа обучения + 1 час свободного самостоятельного плавания с доской - 6000 рупий с человека (2000 рублей). Можно найти дешевле! Рядом с нами обучающиеся ребята нашли инструктора за 3000 рупий + аренда доски на час - 500 рупий.

Сами таже ездили на тук-туке на черепаховый пляж Делавелла бич. Большие, метровые черепашки приплывают к берегу, можно с ними плавать, кормить их. Водоросли стоят 500 рупий (примерно 150 рублей), продают тут же местные. Ездили после обеда - идеальное время, народу немного и солнце не так палит.

Экскурсии: брали у нахваленного здесь в отзывах Михаила Сафари в парк Яла и Элла. Михаил тоже подвел: нас было 9 человек (6 взрослых и 3 детей), договорились на индивидуальную экскурсию 9 января с русскоговорящим гидом. Вечером накануне пишет, что не нашел гида, придется перенести на 10. Ну ок, 10 приехал водитель и еле говорящий по английски гид, по русски знающий 5 слов. В итоге экскурсия прошла в молчании :-) Видимо, Михаила здесь слишком разрекламировали и теперь у него много клиентов и можно не заморачиваться :-)
Хотя стоимость действительно, в разы ниже, чем у отельного гида.

Спа: в качестве компенсации удалось побывать там. Стоимость Балийского массажа 1 час - 18500 рупий (почти 6500 рублей) - ну это явно был не массаж, а мягкие поглаживания. Муж вообще ничего не понял :-)

Что хочется сказать в целом об отеле - отель явно не стоит своих денег. Питание - да, неплохое, но на этом плюсы заканчиваются. И очень мутная система бронирования номеров испортила весь отдых и все впечатление. Не претендую своим отзывом на истинность, на вкус и цвет товарищей нет, но в этот отель явно не вернемся, чтобы больше не испортить себе отдых.","Не рекомендую - мутная система бронирования номеров!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d23262280-r989892570-Araliya_Beach_Resort_Spa-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

А этот оказался ужасным.

Персонал ужасный. Проблемы начались уже на ресепшен, долго не могли найти нашу бронь, хотя были документы об оплате, потом нам сказали, что наши номера заняты, и предложили поселить нас в номерах намного хуже на одну ночь с туалетом и душем в одной кабине (ну, а что? Удобно же). 

Долго общались с персоналом отеля, который вообще не пытался идти на контакт и хоть как-то урегулировать ситуацию. Наши оплаченные номера sea view на 7-8 этаже превратились во 2 этаж с видом на внутренний двор и трансформаторы. 

После ночи проведенной в ужасном номере мы все-таки въехали в свои номера, но настроение уже было испорчено и добито ужасным сервисом (грязное белье в номере, просили заменить, но замена такая же грязная и в пятнах). Сходили утром на завтрак, столов вообще не хватает, еду обновляют очень долго, столы после уже после поевших людей вытирают стряхивая остатки еды прямо на стулья и пол. 

Лежаков на пляже категорически не хватает и их нужно занимать со вчерашнего дня. Полотенца на пляже тоже «оставляют желать лучшего».

We finally received the keys to our “accessible rooms”, which we did not need, nor were not told about. With no mention of compensation for the hours lost, we ent to the beach club to have a very late bite to eat and drink to relax. Well that wasn’t going to happen with cold food and waits for over an hour for a hand full of drinks.

Disappointed with our initial experience, we head to the buffet dinner which was underwhelming and basic at best. Surrounded with half of Moscow we finished our dinners and headed to our rooms where the fun starts and both rooms floor due to family members having showers. Water is coming out of the bathroom, into the main room, under the door and out to the hallway. Calling reception in a calm, cool manor was fruitless and was also hung up on by a staff member struggling to speak English,  which led us me to visiting the reception where I was greeted by a Russian interpreter, now as a English speaking and Australian resident this was just adding fuel to the fire. After eventually speaking to a very unhelpful manager and demanding that we be moved and our 70 year old parents be moved also, I made my way back to the room to be met with more non English speaking staff who mop up the water and try to fix with some DYI solution. 

The following morning i spent an hour negotiating a new standard room on another floor which finally happened 4hrs later. 

To say this was a shocking experience would be an understatement.

Warm Greetings from Sigiriya Village!

Thank you for your feedback. However, we would like to clarify that the guest did not release the room on time, which led to a late check-out charge as per our standard policy. Unfortunately, this seems to have resulted in dissatisfaction and the comment left appears to be a reaction to that situation. We strive to maintain fairness and transparency with all our guests and regret any misunderstanding caused.

We appreciate your understanding and hope to welcome you back for another peaceful and nature-filled stay.

She was so welcoming and always had a smile on her face. Even Sudoshan was always smiling and was so nice. Other that that everything was absolutely terrible. Check in time was 2 o’clock and they made us sit and wait for a long time after that too. When we finally got a room it was genuinely so smelly, and it was so obvious that they had done a hasty job by cleaning the room. The sheets were stained, the toilet seat was dirty, I could go on and on. The washroom stunk so bad we tried our best to not fuss but we could not handle it. We requested to change rooms and it was comparatively better then. The buffet was disappointing to say the least. It was very limited, definitely not upto the standards of a 3 star hotel, rather a 1 star. If it was limited but tasted amazing, we would have nothing bad to say, but the taste was disappointing. Also, this is the first hotel I’ve been to wear the man working by the pool would fuss about us taking the pool towels to the room and tell us to bring it back by morning or else he will have to come collect it himself. We came as guests to this hotel to be served, and while I have no problem bringing the pool towels back to the pool area and handing it back, there are ways to request it, kindly asking us if it’s possible for us to bring it instead of how we were told. Taking the towels back didn’t seem like a problem to him when it came to foreigners, but the way locals were treated were extremely disappointing. Overall, I would not visit here again.

Thank you for your feedback. However, we would like to clarify that the issue raised was not due to any fault on our part — the item in question appeared to have been damaged prior to the guest's arrival at the hotel. Additionally, the guest reacted quite negatively when politely informed about the pending dinner bill from the previous night and even mentioned an intention to post about the experience on TripAdvisor. 

We always strive to provide respectful and transparent service, and we regret that this situation was met with such hostility.

Warm Greetings from Sigiriya Village!
 
Firstly thank you for having selected Sigiriya Village as the venue for your bank company outing. We are pleased that at least you liked the location and environment of the hotel. Your review is a very generic statement thus leaving room for much interpretation hence let me clarify what really happened for the benefit of anyone reading your review.
 
Regarding the operational matters you have raised;
 
The standard check-out time (both in Sri Lanka and generally worldwide) is 12:00 noon as this enables the hotel to get ready and turn around the rooms for the next guests as the check in time is 0200 pm. The Front Desk’s communication with your group was in line with this established protocol. We are running a high occupancy at the moment hence a later check-out is not possible as it would delay the arrival of the new guest thus creating yet another complaint. This was clearly communicated by the hotel to the organiser of your group outing hence it should not have been a surprise to you and your group when we requested the rooms to be released by 1200 noon. I trust you understand the protocols governing the check in and checkout timings of hotels.
 
I need to very respectfully remind you that the beverage policy (same in all hotels) was clearly communicated with the organiser of your bank company outing. The hotel operates a licensed bar which serves both local and international beverages. The standard policy in all hotels is that if a guest brings in alcohol and consumes it in a public space then an established corkage charge is charged. In addition to bringing in alcohol, wine and beer your group also brought in bites and soft drinks. I am very surprised that despite the fact that we as a hotel DID NOT CHARGE your group for all these food and beverage items that you brought in, you still decided to go ahead and make derogatory comments about the hotel.
 
We take pride in striving to consistently deliver exceptional experiences to all our guests as evidenced by the numerous positive reviews from our valued guests. We are not perfect as a hotel (and be reminded that no hotel is perfect) yet we strive to be flexible and offer a seamless experience to all our guests. Recollections do seem to vary and should you wish to discuss any aspect of your group visit, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us directly. I will also get in touch with the organiser of your bank’s company outing to further clarify the reality of what really happened with regard to your visit.

Warm Regards,

Zameer Deen

Our booking was originally for two nights, but we were fortunate enough to be able to move to a much better hotel (next door) after out first night. One night was enough.

The grounds of the hotel are very pretty and appear well maintained, but it it would appear that the whole complex is in need of some very serious TLC. Our rooms had been sadly neglected in general maintenance and cleanliness. The bed coverlet was stained and the wall hanging behind the bed was dusty and stained.

The bathroom had signs of mould and disrepair, meaning that having a shower was not a pleasant experience. In one of our rooms, there was a freshly painted ceiling, which I suspect was done to cover up a damp or mould issue.

The entrance door to the room was in poor condition and difficult to open & close. 

The dining option was a buffet, overseen by a group of young people with little or no customer service skills. In fact, they seemed happier in each other's company, than that of the guests.  Food was poor quality (in fact the food was the worst we encountered on our trip around Sri Lanka). The furnishings in the dining hall were old, worn and badly in need of replacement.

The swimming pool, whilst looking appealing, was unattractive with damaged tiles on the bottom having been replaced with different coloured odd tiles, making it look like a second rate and cheap attempt at maintenance.

Overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I have rated it accordingly. The hotel's only saving grace was it's proximity to Lion Rock.

Sigiriya Village was supposed to be our most luxurious stay, and we had such high hopes. While some of our previous accommodations weren’t as big, clean, or well-located, the staff everywhere else were incredibly kind and helpful. Sadly, that has not been the case here, and one rotten apple spoiled it for everyone.

To start, the rooms are spacious and clean, which seemed promising. However, extending our stay for an extra night was a hassle. While Booking.com showed a price of €83 (including tax), the front desk quoted €100. After showing them the online price, they reluctantly agreed to €95, citing unclear “rate” explanations. We felt scammed and frustrated.

Yesterday, it rained, a normal occurrence in Sri Lanka, but to our shock, the rain came inside our room. Water streamed down the walls and through the ceiling, soaking our suitcase full of clothes. Housekeeping came initially and assured us we’d get a new room and that they’d wash our clothes. After that, we heard nothing from the staff. We called the front desk, and they promised to call back in 5 minutes. An hour later, still no update. Frustrated, we went to the front desk, and waiting again, they finally gave us a new room. Why did we have to wait over two hours and only get answers after showing up in person? The service of the front desk was again absolutely unacceptable.

The restaurant was equally disappointing. We ordered à la carte instead of trying the buffet, and it was a mistake. My “vegetable noodles” were 95% noodles with almost no vegetables—just a few pieces of pineapple and tomato (fruits). My partner’s pork chops were mostly fat and bone, with hardly any meat.

The only positive thing about our stay was the wellness center. The head massage we had there was incredible, felt completely reborn afterward! The people working there are sweet, skilled, and truly amazing. If you’re looking for a good wellness experience, I would recommend it. But everything else here? A complete disaster.

Save your money and your patience. Apart from the wellness center, this place is a full-on disappointment.","Extremely disappointing stay – Only the Wellness Center is worth it","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d447407-r989444357-Sigiriya_Village_Hotel-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Personalet er totalt uuddannede og med absolut ingen erfaring eller viden om hvordan ting skal gøres. 
Fx var det ikke muligt at få flaske vand til morgenmaden. Personalet forstod sjældent hvad vi spurgte om. Det er den type hotel der har mærkelige ting for at få stjerner; fx et stort bord midt i det hele med en vinopsats med månedens vin. Ingen forholder sig til det, bestiller det eller gør noget. 

Maden er modbydelig. Gammelt mad der går igen og igen i buffeen. Og personalet ved ikke hvordan råvarerne skal tilberedes. Det ville være mere indbydende og spiseligt hvis de holdt sig til færrere retter og inden for det de ved noget om og behersker. Stort set alt andet end et ristet brød var decideret ulækkert. 
Hver gang vi prøvede at bestille a la carte, kom de på alle mulige historier og prøvede at presse os til buffet. De lokker/presser med 10% rabat på buffet, så 15% osv…helt vildt mærkeligt, som om at de ikke har nogen retter, køkken eller personalet. 

De siger de har cykler, men det har de ikke-dem har de ikke lige fået repeteret… meget specielt luftkastel.

J’ai séjourné 8 jours dans cet établissement et plusieurs points négatifs sont à signaler :
	•	Le buffet ne respecte pas toujours la chaîne du froid, ce qui est préoccupant. Cela nous a malheureusement valu une intoxication alimentaire, nous obligeant à passer une journée entière cloués au lit.
	•	L’offre “all inclusive” est très limitée : seulement 4 cocktails et 5 boissons sans alcool inclus. Pour des cocktails classiques comme mojito ou piña colada, il faut payer en supplément.
	•	L’hôtel est situé très loin des principaux lieux d’excursion : il faut souvent se lever à 4h du matin pour participer aux activités.
	•	Bien que la mer soit proche, la baignade y est interdite en raison des fortes vagues, ce qui est assez frustrant.

Cela étant dit, l’hôtel reste agréable si vous souhaitez principalement vous reposer et profiter du calme sans chercher à beaucoup visiter.
Le personnel est globalement souriant et accueillant, à l’exception du Monsieur de l’accueil Dananjaya qui s’est permis de couper nos bracelets “all inclusive” en plein après-midi, devant tout le monde, alors que notre départ n’était prévu que plusieurs heures plus tard (18h).
Par ailleurs, aucune chambre de courtoisie n’est proposée avant le départ, seulement des douches publiques dont la propreté laisse à désirer côté hommes, sans serviettes mises à disposition.

Enfin, un grand merci à la représentante Ôclub, très professionnelle et à l’écoute, qui a fait de son mieux pour rendre notre séjour plus agréable malgré ces désagréments.","Hôtel pas digne d’un 5 étoiles","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r1004731738-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Greetings from Pandanus Beach Resort & Spa!

We regret & apologies the inconvenience occurred in your stay as per your review to the Tripadvisor. 

As you are aware the sea of the south west coast was completely rough as per the Meteorology Department reports in Sri Lanka and all of us were experiencing the same with heavy winds due to the aforementioned scenario. Hence, we couldn't use the rooftop entertainment area which we have notified to our In-house guests. 

Our staff made ensure regular cleaning of the rooms. You should have mentioned your concerns to the room boy or the management. So that we could take immediate action to make your stay  comfortable.

The food quality we were maintaining with about 100+ guests and not a single guests raised any concerns about spiciness of the food, food quality and food varieties. We always give big spread with different varieties including Traditional food corner with other international dishes.

We regret that you have not raised your concerns before your departure or during your stay to the staff to resolve your concerns and for you to enjoy your holiday at our hotel. Even in your Guest Satisfaction Card mentioned all good.

Points positifs :

L’hôtel est relativement beau. Les lits sont grands et les chambres assez spacieuses.

La piscine est très belle et offre une belle longueur pour nager. 

Les couchers de soleils sont vraiment agréables en soirée.

Le personnel reste très gentil et très accueillant. 

Des tuk-tuks sont présents en permanence devant l’hôtel pour vous emmener à droite à gauche et leurs tarifs sont honnêtes. Des excursions assez onéreuses sont proposées par l’hôtel (il n’y a pas grand chose à faire autour de l’hôtel sinon).

Points négatifs :

Au moment ou j’écris cet avis, la plage est devenu inexistante. Ne vous fiez donc pas aux photos de l’hôtel. Il n’y a plus du tout de plage et la mer vient frappé un peu plus chaque nuit les bords de l’hôtel. C’est vraiment à se demander quand jusque quand est-ce que ça va tenir. 3 palmiers sont tombés en une nuit durant notre séjour. Sans compter ce qu’il y a en guise de sable (des sacs de sacs de plastiques pour tenter de limiter les dégâts et de nombreux déchets..). 

Pour un hôtel de cette gamme, aucun réelle animation interne à l’hôtel n’est proposé si ce n’est du volet dans la piscine, un billard (payant même en all inclusive) et des fléchettes. On s’attend à plus de choses pour un 5*….

La propreté des chambres laisse vraiment à désirer. Même si les chambres sont plutôt belles, notre spa/baignoire était très sale. Nous ne l’avons même pas utilisé.

Le bruit dans cet hôtel est également un point négatif. Les chambres étant très mal isolées et l’hôtel en bord de route, on entend chaque klaxon et chaque voiture qui passe toutes les nuits.

La nourriture est peu variée et très épicée. Pour un pays ou les fruits sont très présents, nous n’avons eu droit qu’à de la pastèque et de l’ananas pendant 5 jours.

Ayant séjourné dans deux gammes de chambres, nous n’avons pas compris pourquoi les chambres haut de gamme avaient droits à une légère couverture et celles bas de gamme à de simples draps. 

La terrasse du rooftop était fermé durant tout notre séjour donc nous n’avons pas pu en profiter. Ouvert seulement le samedi et nous partions le vendredi. L’accueil vous dit que vous pouvez demander l’ouverture de celui-ci mais en réalité la terrasse est vide car les chaises et tables sont toutes empilées, ce qui est très dommage vu la belle vue de l’hôtel. Cet endroit devrait être ouvert tous les jours.

Nous sommes un peu déçu de ce dernier hôtel dans lequel nous étions censé profiter pour la fin de notre séjour. En réalité, nous avons préférés les autres hôtels que nous avons faits qui étaient pourtant des 3 ou 4*.","Correct mais décevant","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r950709181-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Будте готовы, что покупая тур в этот отель, можете остаться без отеля. Вот вам и сервис.... 

По поводу пляжа, приезжали, смотрели.... пляж худший во всей Бентоте т.к. сразу глубоко и круто. 
Номера ""супериор"" очень плохие. Вы будете в отдельном корпусе на задворках. Лежаков ужасно не хватает, не пришли рано утром - лежите на земле :(((

Приехали в 17:00,отдали документы на ресепшн и ожидали около 20 минут. В отеле идут ремонтные работы,белят потолки,красят стены,везде расставлены стремянки,приходится в согнутом виде через них проползать. 
Номер дали на первом этаже,ничего особенного,одна кровать большая,диван,шкаф с пару вешалками,радует что в душе есть и холодная и горячая вода. Дают шампунь,гель для душа и мыло,но не каждый день. Туалетную бумагу не считают нужным приносить. Полотенца забирают утром и потом приносят только к вечеру. Захотите в обед обмыться,будете ходить мокрым. 
Пляж: всегда волны,купаться невозможно. Мы уходим к камням влево,там они не такие сильные,но  там есть пена в которой не очень приятно плавать. 
С погодой не очень повезло. Каждый день вечером идёт дождь. Из 9 дней 4 дня днём не было солнца и тоже шел дождь.
Еда: брали завтрак и ужин. На завтрак яйца,сосиски,овощи,бывает мясо,но оно жесткое и не вкусное. Из фруктов ананас, папайя и арбуз. Чай,кофе и пару видов сока. На ужин картошка,рис,мясное блюдо (курица или говядина-но острова то),пару раз давали морепродукты под соусом. Так же фрукты и сладости. 
Очень сильно напрягает то что пристают с экскурсиями местные жители,просят телефон,хочешь сделать фото,а они встают рядом и пристально смотрят. Лежишь на лежаке,встанут напротив тебя и тоже стоят смотрят. Предлагают купить то картины,то специи...
В отеле очень много немцев. Включали музыку на море,к нам подошли и попросили отключить. Потому что они читают и мы им мешаем. Вечером на баре та же самая история. Приходят и говорят что они ложатся спать в 9 вечера,а мы тут будим их. 
Больше всего не понравилось отношение отельных работников к отдыхающим. Когда покупали у них пиво,они все улыбались,разговаривали на русском,а как только пришли с алкоголем купленным из соседнего кафе,нам сказали что нужно за это заплатить либо идти пить в номер. Нашу просьбу вернуть нам деньги за оставшиеся дни отдыха (чтобы сменить отель) тоже проигнорировали.
Вообще расположение отеля ужасное. Чтобы поехать на экскурсию,всё далеко. Например экскурсия Элла: до водопада Равана 4 часа езды,9-ти арочный мост 2.5 часа. 
Если поеду ещё на Шри-Ланка то точно не в этот отель. ","Pandanus отель","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r929626901-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Отель старенький, потасканный. В номерах довольно просторно, есть всё необходимое. Будьте осторожны с сушилкой на балконе - в местах креплений проступает ржавчина, сохнущая одежда может быть испорчена. Не слишком удобные матрасы и подушки, которые, к тому же, попахивают сыростью. В душе плохо уходит вода, соответственно, на полу всегда лужа. Кондиционер не регулировался и был очень шумным. Невероятно грязные шторы. Уборка в номерах посредственная. Постоянно не хватало полотенец - во время уборки их забирали, а новых клали не полный комплект или не клали вовсе. Воды давали бесплатно 2 бутылки по 0,5 л в день - и это на двух взрослых человек! Кулера нигде нет, жлобство(((
На пляже всем хватало лежаков, но они также старые, тяжёлые, деревянные. Матрасы на время дождя не уносили, просто складывали, чтобы с них стекала вода, но они все равно промокали внутри(((  На пляж каждый день приходят местные продавалы-приставалы: с экскурсиями, массажем, кокосами, какими-то благовониями. Две женщины трясли своими тряпками по доллару, раскладывая их прямо на земле🙈 Также приходил мужчина с несчастной голодной обезьянкой, коброй и питоном. По всему побережью также бегают собаки (неагрессивные), пасутся коровы. Мусор повсюду, его убирают только на той части пляжа, которая относится к отелю, но и то не слишком тщательно. Песок на пляже в черных разводах - горючее, наверное. С обуви до конца так и не отмылось.
Возле отеля пойти особо некуда - кафешки и ресторанчики перемежаются отелями, заброшенными и нет. За всеми покупками - в Бентоту, 1-2$ на тук-туке туда-обратно. Советую не покупать чай и специи в сувенирных лавках, куда вас будут усиленно зазывать - цены там завышены. Прекрасный выбор в супермаркете Небула.   Алкоголь только отдельно продается, в специальных алко-маркетах, ну и фрукты в лавках (торгуйтесь, цен там нет).
Алко-маркет, кстати, есть в пяти минутах от отеля пешком по дороге направо, в сторону Галле, но выбор там меньше, чем в Бентоте.
Итог - не рекомендую.","Октябрь 2023","2023-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r921854766-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

However, when we placed the order it was 9:10 PM. At the time when we were placing the order, the staff didn't refuse to take our order. 

After placing the order and waiting for over an hour, the staff refused to serve our food and did not even inform us about it. The chef and the GM also refused to give a reasonable explanation. Judging by the way we were treated, it's safe to assume that they treat local gusests with a certain negative attitude. I myself is an employee at a reputed hotel in Sri Lanka, and I constantly strive to serve any and all guests I receive with utmost respect. 

Based on how we were treated, I do not recommend this restuarant to any one who wants to grab a quick bite or a meal.

However, the manager started blaming us for losing the keys and started asking for 7500 as payment. We asked them to check cctv footage’s etc but got no help. Upon our checkout, he again harassed us for the payment which seemed unreasonable. He kept citing their company policy for justifying 7500 payment. I insisted on seeing that document which mentions charges of 7500 for loss of keys. He said he couldn’t find the document and will share on my email address. I am writing this review just shy of a year as I was hoping to get their policy document which they promised to send us. But I never received one. Seems it was arbitrary amount of 7500 which was damn too high.

The point is, in a hospitality business, instead of being friendly and reasonable to the customers, the approach was to extract money out of customers. They didn’t hesitate creating a scene at the checkout and being rude about their demand. Anyways, we proved that the keys were lost in their hotel premises (near pool) and they are equally responsible if someone (guest/employee) has picked it up intentionally or by mistake.

Had the most terrible experience there.

Positives- Great location, the property is right at the beach. the view from all the rooms is breathtaking. The rooms were spacious and clean.That is it. There is nothing else I could tell positive beyond it. 

Negatives- Let me start from the moment we reached the hotel. We enter this big gloomy lobby. It was very unattractive and dimly lighted. We waited for 15 mins for the rooms to be allocated. 
1) Requested the staff at the counter to give a room on the ground floor since my parents were old. The response was a plain NO. So we had to settle for the rooms they gave us.
2) Requested the the room service twice to send coffee sachets for the rooms. Even after repeated calls nobody ever came.
3) In the restaurant during breakfast, requested the F & B staff to get a tea, he directed me to the tea counter and refused to get it.
4) During dinner buffet, went to the barbeque counter and requested for a chicken piece, Nobody every came to my table
5) Next night at dinner, my mother was around the desserts counter when one of the staff asked her, what she wanted to have and she said an ice cream which he said would get it to our table. Nobody ever came even after waiting for 15 minutes.
6) We were about to leave for the site seeing when it started raining heavily. I went to the lobby and requested the gentleman for an umbrella. The answer was expected ''NO SIR, we don't have umbrellas''. I remembered that there were umbrellas in our rooms provided by the hotel. I requested them to send them to send someone to get it and again the answer was the same. ""NO, we cant do it''
7)The day we were leaving at the lobby i requested for a bottle of water and i was flabbergasted by the response when i was told that we cant give you a bottle of water. They did not even say that it was going to be chargeable. They said we cant get you a water bottle.

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your stay at the Mermaid Hotel. We truly regret that your experience did not meet your expectations, and we appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.

We take cleanliness and guest comfort very seriously. Our housekeeping team ensures that all towels, sunbeds, and rooms meet high hygiene standards. If there were any issues upon your arrival, we sincerely apologize and would have been happy to resolve them immediately had we been informed.

Regarding noise levels, we strive to balance entertainment and guest comfort. Our live music, which many guests enjoy, is scheduled to end by 11:00 PM. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused and would have gladly arranged for a quieter room had we been notified.

The beach adjacent to our hotel is public, and while we do not control external vendors, our team is always available to assist guests in navigating such situations.

We understand your concerns about dining hygiene and can assure you that all food is prepared according to ISO standards. We regret if your experience did not reflect this and appreciate your feedback as we continuously strive to improve.

It is disappointing to hear that you chose to shorten your stay. We would have been happy to explore alternative arrangements to enhance your experience. Nonetheless, we sincerely value your feedback and would love the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.

The worst was the noise from the live band playing every night . It was so loud it sounded like the band were in our room. 
The room was dirty and need a complete re vamp. 
The pool beds were so dirty they were covered with white sheets to hide the stains . 
The beach is covered in rubbish and you are accosted from touts as soon as you step onto the beach . 
You can’t walk to any restaurants or bars from the hotel and especially not along the beach. 

The hotel offered to move us room, however it would not have solved the problems of this awful hotel, as you could hear the band form every part of this hotel, and the hotel would still be dirty and unclean . 

The hotel is dirty and not clean, staff un helpfully , breakfast is not covered up , so covered in flies .

Thank you for sharing your feedback, and we regret that your experience at the Mermaid Hotel & Club did not meet your expectations. We take all guest concerns seriously and always aim to provide the best hospitality while maintaining the safety and security of everyone on our premises.

In this instance, our team, led by Duty Manager Sameera, acted in accordance with hotel policy, which is designed to prioritize guest safety and security. As per our policy, external visitors are not permitted in guest rooms for security reasons, but we made several alternative suggestions, including the use of our garden lounge and public spaces like the hotel lobby and bar. Despite this, we found the policy had not been respected, and we had to make the decision to ask external visitors to leave, ensuring the safety of all guests.

We understand that this situation may have been disappointing, but we hope you appreciate that our priority is always the safety and well-being of our guests. We value your feedback and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future under more favorable circumstances.

Thank you for sharing your feedback, and we regret that your experience at the Mermaid Hotel & Club did not meet your expectations. We take all guest concerns seriously and always aim to provide the best hospitality while maintaining the safety and security of everyone on our premises.

In this instance, our team, led by Duty Manager Sameera, acted in accordance with hotel policy, which is designed to prioritize guest safety and security. As per our policy, external visitors are not permitted in guest rooms for security reasons, but we made several alternative suggestions, including the use of our garden lounge and public spaces like the hotel lobby and lounge bar. Despite this, we found the policy had not been respected, and we had to make the decision to ask external visitors to leave, ensuring the safety of all guests.

We understand that this situation may have been disappointing, but we hope you appreciate that our priority is always the safety and well-being of our guests. We value your feedback and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future under more favorable circumstances.

Warm regards,

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced. Please allow me to address your concerns.

Firstly, regarding the absence of bottled water in your room, our hotel has made a conscious decision to reduce plastic waste and support environmental sustainability. Upon arrival, we inform our guests that water dispensers are available in the corridors, and flasks are provided for your convenience. We apologize if this information was not clearly communicated to you.

We regret to hear about the issues with the hot water, room odor, air conditioning, and the broken bathroom door. It is our standard procedure to address any reported issues promptly. Unfortunately, it seems these concerns were not reported to our management during your stay, preventing us from taking immediate action to resolve them.

We are pleased to hear that you found our staff to be pleasant and enjoyed the outside view. However, we regret that the food did not meet your expectations entirely. Your feedback regarding the breakfast pastries will be shared with our culinary team to ensure improvements are made.

We strive to provide the best possible experience for our guests, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us achieve that goal. We hope you will consider giving us another opportunity to serve you better in the future.

Sincerely,

Thomas Rodrigo","4032","750372598","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b9/c6/f6/caption.jpg","3024","4032","750372599","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b9/c6/f7/caption.jpg","3024","4032","750372600","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b9/c6/f8/caption.jpg","3024","4032","750372601","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b9/c6/f9/caption.jpg","3024","4032","750372602","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/b9/c6/fa/caption.jpg","3024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mahawaskaduwa, Kalutara 12000 Sri Lanka","Kalutara","Sri Lanka","12000",,"Mahawaskaduwa",,"316671","6.617499","Kalutara, Western Province","79.94607","Mermaid Hotel & Club","3509","4.6","33","42","139","724","2572","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304136-d316671-Reviews-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html","http://www.mermaidhotelnclub.com/","2024-07-02","OTHER","2","Always ask for new rooms","Value","2","Rooms","2","Location","4","Cleanliness","3","Service","4","Sleep Quality","3",,,"Disappointed to say this this was the worst stay I ever had.

Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. However, we would like to clarify that the issues you mentioned regarding the change in accommodation and the cancellation of your all-inclusive package were not within the control of the hotel.

As you rightly pointed out, these issues were caused by the actions of your travel agent. While we empathize with the frustration you must have felt, we must stress that our hotel cannot be held responsible for the mistakes or shortcomings of third-party booking agencies.

We regret any confusion or disappointment these circumstances may have caused you, and we understand the importance of a smooth and enjoyable vacation experience. Please know that we are committed to providing the best possible service to all of our guests, and we would have done everything in our power to rectify the situation if it had been within our control.

We hope that despite these challenges, you were still able to enjoy your time with us and make the most of your stay. Should you have any further concerns or if there is anything we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

We were looking forward to the beach and pool and after a long 8 hour journey from Eliya with a couple of stops along the way finally arrived at this hotel. 
First impression was slightly depressing as we waited a while for service at reception (we were always welcomed immediately at our other stops). 
We were shown to our room past a bleak looking, dirty ‘pond’ that looked like it needed a good clean, then down a long twisting corridor of empty water coolers and tired looking tiles with dirty grout.
The room we were given smelled of damp which we worked out came from the air conditioning. The bathroom was ok but had a mouldy basket that was empty of any complementary’s other than one soap and a shower hat. I have included photos of the other issues in the room. It was ratty, forlorn and felt dirty.
We complained and were offered a better room which we took, although the door lock was broken and there was an old single bed dumped outside the room. Luckily our tour operator was great and got us out of there the next morning.
As well as the above the pool was slimy looking on the tiles, the gym and other amenities were deserted and some things out of order. 
The beach was another issue with local men hanging about at the fence hassling for ‘tours’ and generally being oppressive and slightly scary. 
We love dogs but there were dogs everywhere with litters of puppies so the hotel set off regular firecrackers to scare them away (which doesn’t work, but gives you a shock).
We couldn’t wait to get out and will never return.","Terrible","2020-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d316671-r744349588-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Dear Ms. Katarina,
Thank you for your patronage and for taking the time to leave us your honest feedback. I am deeply saddened to hear such below expectation experience and I do sincerely apologize for such encounters.

I must admit that the issues with the food varieties is quite an issue. However, this is not an excuse and we are acting on these issues immediately. Also kindly note that prices at the hotel are in line with other hotels of similar caliber as we carry similar costs and we deliver similar quality.

Your statements on our products and services are very helpful and we always find guest feedback indispensable to maintain our high quality and for continuous improvement. I am sorry once again that we missed the opportunity to wow you and to deliver an experience that is akin to our brand. I do hope that this single stay did not permanently tarnish your perception of our resort and that you might reconsider a return visit and allow us to show the progress we have made in the areas you have kindly highlighted to our attention.

We wish you happy and peaceful 2020,
With best regards,
Dayan Ganegoda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mahawaskaduwa, Kalutara 12000 Sri Lanka","Kalutara","Sri Lanka","12000",,"Mahawaskaduwa",,"316671","6.617499","Kalutara, Western Province","79.94607","Mermaid Hotel & Club","3509","4.6","33","42","139","724","2572","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304136-d316671-Reviews-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html","http://www.mermaidhotelnclub.com/","2020-01-02","OTHER","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mermaid hotel
I do not see a reason why would somebody go to this hotel. I feel specifically cheated, because we paid 1300 usd for 3 nights halfboard around NYE. And the hotel is ugly outdated 3 star hotel. Even though they tried well on NYE buffet, otherwise the food was average at the best. Plus, zero choice on nonspicy dishes. Breakfast only till 9.30! How inappropriate in holiday resort! But the dinner would start first at 7.30 pm! 
Room - would be ok, deluxe with beach access, if at least they would have the mosquito nets on the balcony door (mind you, you can't open any window). With mosquitos present, we w forced to sleep in the closed very smelly room! There were terrible smell of the fumes in the room for whole night, probably from the traffic of nearby road. Plus the matrasses smell of piss. We came late first night, than was the NYE and we simply did not have energy to move to another room offered, which was on the 3rd floor anyway so no access to the beach. And i suspected the fumes would be present anyway.
Beach and sea - there were waves at the sea, but it was not too strong, still our 5 y old daughter was scared to bath. Even worse, the water was muddy colour, probably from nearby river (Kalu means black river!) Otherwise the beach looked nice, yellow sand and palms.
Pool - there was nothing appaling on non shaded rectangular outdated pool. Even not enough of umbrellas around. Water was warm. 
All and all quite unpleasant and shockingly expensive stay for what you've got. 
The staff was ok, the best job did housekeeping with cleaning our room very nicely everyday.","No reason to visit this place","2019-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d316671-r736447342-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Dear All Viewers,

This reviewer was using the privilege of posting a comment to express his frustration on charging of damages to the property assets, we confirm that pool light damage was not an accident but it was a deliberate attempt which was done by the reviewer’s children even after requested twice by the pool attendant not to remove the globe lights as there will be a safety risk and might cause damage to the light cover. This was confirmed by the other guests who were nearby and CCTV footage also confirmed that it was not an accident. 

Apart from the above, we could not find any solid evidence for his other concerns except one more damage in the room where he spent 03 nights with his family. Therefore we conclude that this was a vengeance attempt against our property and we kindly request you to review other postings to have a better understanding of our property. 
         
With best regards,
Dayan Ganegoda.

We have stayed there for 3 nights The moment we step into our Deluxe Room the room phone found to be out of service which you can’t call the reception or the room service . This take them nearly  24 hours to get resolved.Also, the bathtub faucet was broken ( only hot water available) 
Once the phone it got fixed we realized that the room service is very poor as it takes ages to have what you need.  
Our dining experience was not so bad.However, the waiters over there are extremely busy to the extend that nobody can entertain you “ simply help your self “ they may need to increase few staff to cover the requirements of the guests . 

On top of that, one of the light post cover at the pool area was originally cracked and glued, the moment my 6 yrs old son touched it , same has been fallen and got more damaged,on spot, the Hotel GM reach to us and instead of asking about the safety and condition of my son, he immediately informed us that we have to pay for the light cover replacement imposing $20 .
I hope this time they will get the light replaced .","Not Recommended for Family Stay","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d316671-r736030326-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",
