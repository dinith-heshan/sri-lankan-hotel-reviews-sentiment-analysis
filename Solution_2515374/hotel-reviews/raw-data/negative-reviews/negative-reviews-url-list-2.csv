We own few properties. All have highly trained domestic  and  maintenance  staff  who  maintain it throughout the year. 

This is the first time we had guests who did not wish any staff at the Chalet  during their stay.  I admit the staff have not followed instructions but entered the property to clean the chalet, pool and garden which annoyed our guests. Thereafter staff was given strict instructions not to enter the property.  The Chalet has a staff entrance at the back of the property but the manager uses the main entrance to meet the clients.

In the tropics close to the beach homes have to be cleaned and maintained on a daily basic due to humidity, dust and the  salt in the sea breeze.

Pool is cleaned between 5.30 am - 7 am and treated in the nights to prevent water changing colour and moss building in the cemented pool.Since staff were instructed not to enter the property the pool maintain was was neglected. When pool is not treated on a daily basis it complicates the maintenance.

Since the clients wanted a refund.  We were prepared to give it to them, but clients did not want to leave the chalet.  

On hearing of their complaint I  met clients the following day. ( owner lives in Colombo)

All bedroom windows have glass as the bedrooms are air conditioned. the staff would not dare to put newspapers on the windows. All windows have wooden panels, if clients wanted blinds on the top glass our seamstress available 24 hours would have stitched the blinds within 2 hours.

We have a standby electrician in the village who attends to short comings within the day.  When there is NO sunlight the solar power works on electricity..

The Chalet has  4G dialog connection. Sometimes signals could be low due to bad weather.

I admit our staff at the Chalet has a limited knowledge of English. The houseboy is in his 20's, we give young staff opportunities at our properties.

The manager is quite fluent in English, he is on call from 7 am to 8.30 pm and meets guests on a daily basis to check regarding their meal request, tours and to attend to any short comings.

We do not provide  mobile phones. But on clients insistence,  the manager  provided a mobile phone with Rs. 1000/- reload. for their use.

We went the extra mile to make the stay of our clients memorable and sorry that the clients did not appreciate the complimentaries which was offered, which we do to all our guests.
We once again apologize for any short comings faced by our guests.","1500","119803156","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0d/14/south-point-villa.jpg","2000","1500","119803148","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0d/0c/south-point-villa.jpg","2000","1500","119803142","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0d/06/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803132","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/fc/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803123","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/f3/south-point-villa.jpg","2000","1500","119803117","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/ed/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803112","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/e8/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803107","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/e3/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803100","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/dc/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803096","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/d8/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803089","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/d1/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803077","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/c5/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803064","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/b8/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803042","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/a2/south-point-villa.jpg","2000","1500","119803037","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/9d/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803026","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/92/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803019","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/8b/south-point-villa.jpg","1125","1500","119803011","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/24/0c/83/south-point-villa.jpg","1125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Road Kathaluwa, Ahangama 80650 Sri Lanka","Ahangama","Sri Lanka","80650",,"Matara Road","Kathaluwa","643117","5.980658","Ahangama, Galle District, Southern Province","80.340675","South Point Villa","251","4.9","1","1","1","11","237","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g674590-d643117-Reviews-South_Point_Villa-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.southpointvilla.com/","2015-01-04","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Cleanliness","1","Service","1",,,,,,,"The Chalet. A truly awful experience. 

We had booked one week here after an idyllic week at another villa nearer Galle which cost $250 per day. The Chalet was $400 per day (Peak Christmas period) so we expected something pretty good. Arrived to find the Chalet, filthy, broken and totally unprepared for guests.

We spent the WHOLE of the first day and much of the second day getting more and more frustrated and angry as our holiday was being used up getting the villa we were paying $400 a night for to be cleaned and fixed by slow, rude and unhelpful staff. 
On day 5 of 7 we asked the owner Sonali Gunaratne for a refund for  the lost days but she suggested we just ""check out and find somewhere else"". So Sonali, we said to you we would do this and just so no-one else has to go through what we went through, here we go....

KITCHEN. Absolutely disgusting. Sorry no pictures of this, was too shocked. Dirty one and half year old newspapers covering grimy glasses and dirty toaster. Fridge full of ants, so couldn't use it. Rubbish and bottles from previous people still piled up by dirty old bin. More grimy cutlery, crockery and utensils stored in a dirty store room full of old boxes and general rubbish.

BATHROOM. Hot water system is a combination of solar and electric. Electric system didn't work so during 4 days of rain had to wash and shower in cold water despite constant pleas to have it fixed, and being told it will be. It took 5 days to be repaired. FIVE DAYS!! No glass in upper windows so mosquitos fly straight in.

BEDROOM. Ceiling fan was stuck on super fast turbo. Impossible to sleep with noise. Took days to have fixed. Bed sheets were old and torn. No mattress cover so very unhygienic. No curtains, just shutters covering lower window so the morning sun blasts straight in. Had to ask for a covering...so they sellotaped newspapers over the windows. 
There are no wardrobes or drawers for clothes, just a couple of tables and a hanging rack.
Had to ask for clothes hangers.
Half the light bulbs in the bedroom and villa were broken and had to be replaced.
We asked for a mosquito net as soon as we arrived. Mosquitos are rampant. This was met with complete bewilderment. Why would anyone want a mosquito net?  2 days later it grudgingly arrived.

POOL. Dirty. Unswimmable. Green mould and algae on bottom of pool. Pool pump to circulate the water didn't work. Despite constant pleas to fix it and being told every day that it would be, we left a week later and it still was broken. Spent hours with manager pointing at the filth while he said it ""would be fixed""
So we didn't swim.

WiFi: Waited 2 days for it to be ""mended"".

STAFF: Pretty much non-English speaking staff. I have to remind you that this is a $400 a night villa.
The villa manager Gamine had quite an attitude about him and is inefficient and slow, seemingly bewildered with the concept of fixing things. He suggested we ring him on our own phones with international calling costs if we needed to call him. He eventually lent us a mobile phone with a few rupees on it. Good for 2 calls. Took a day for him to put more credit on it.
Upal, who seems to spend most of his time at South Point Villa across the road, was unhelpful to the point of rudeness. 
The pair of them could not comprehend that they should have sorted ALL of this before we arrived. They're totally untrained to provide the service that is expected for the price they're charging and totally unsuited to the hospitality business. The houseboy Shanti was charming and but only did what the others told him. 
All 3 of them would wander into the villa area at any time of day unannounced from any of the 3 gates.
The gardener would wake us up sweeping at 7.00am. Had to ask him  to stop.

THE OWNER. Sonali Gunaratne. Based in Colombo 2.5 hours away. We rang her and emailed her about the problems. She didn't really want to know. She eventually visited and saw for herself, saying it wasn't obviously good enough. But then she disappeared back to the city and as our problems continued she ignored our calls and emails. She has taken the money and run.
Take my advice and don't touch this place with a barge pole.","The Chalet. Just don't.","2014-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d643117-r247347764-South_Point_Villa-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Before responding to this complaint, we rechecked with the party who booked the property and she was unaware of any problem regarding  billing.

The welcome was lackluster, with staff appearing surprised to have us, and there wasn't even a welcome drink. The entire setup felt rigid, and despite being in a perfect location, the service was horrendous. The potential of the place is overshadowed by poor management.

Having visited various Jetwing locations, including Yala, Blue, Beach, Sands, and St. Andrews, I've never encountered worse customer service. The refusal to let us use the pool without booking a room added to the frustration. Attempting to discuss this with the general manager proved futile, as he claimed to be too busy, reflecting a disappointing management style that seems to permeate the entire organization.

It's disheartening to witness such a gem of a location tarnished by Jetwing Gallery Kandy's subpar standards. Urgent changes in top management or comprehensive training are imperative for this establishment to meet the high standards associated with the Jetwing brand. We ultimately left for Earls Regency, where the service contrast was strikingly superior. Despite its scenic beauty, Jetwing Gallery Kandy falls short in delivering the hospitality Sri Lanka is renowned for, especially in a culturally rich city like Kandy.","Gem of a location with immense potential ","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199423-d19395712-r933799014-Jetwing_Kandy_Gallery_A_Luxury_Reserve-Gurudeniya_Kandy_District_Central_Provi.html",

I've been to many Sri Lankan hotels, but this was the first time I've ever experienced a hotel like this where there is NO buffet or ala-carte option; and you just get a set menu with very limited/if any choices and you can only select ONE main course. 

Even then, you cannot mix and match western and eastern styled breakfasts for instance (which would possible obviously in a buffet system). I for one, really like to eat scrambled eggs and bacon but I also liked to try out the fish or chicken curry to sprinkle a bit of gravy on the scrambled egg; but no, even THIS was not allowed by the ""rules"" cause I ordered the scrambled eggs dish which fell under one portion; and I had to specifically request even a small gravy potion. I mean... this level of organizational rigidness at this place just blew my mind.

The QUALITY of the small portions was not good either; ""lemongrass soup"" was like as if someone boiled grass with salt water; absolutely tasteless,  a ""Seafood noodles"" dish had only two prawns in a small bowl-like plate,""baked beans"" was not the normal long grain beans but some small local one, the list goes on. This is just not a professionally trained F&B service.

it just didn't feel like freedom here; it feels like compulsion. You feel like going for a swim and you're hungry after... there's no pool bar to grab a sandwich or anything. 

Overall, felt like we were in some kind of strict boarding school or rehab clinic and not a hotel. 

The rooms and washroom and the physical environment in general look ultra modern and sophisticated, which  is good for a new ish hotel; but that's about the only plus for me. 

If you're someone who likes the outdoors and just doesn't care about food (strange as it is), then you'll love it here but not my cup of tea for sure.

Warm greetings from Crystal Sands! 

We are very sorry to hear that you did not have a great experience at Crystal Sands. This is the first TripAdvisor review we have received that is under 4 stars following our opening last year, and we take your input very seriously. We strive to provide our guests with an unparalleled experience, and we are truly sorry that yours has not been a positive one.

With regards to the images, the pictures shared are actual images of the hotel and the Sky Villas. Our starting category of Sky Villa, the Palm Sky Villa is 850sqft and the categories that follow, the Sands Sky Villa and Surf Sky Villa are 1050sqft, 1456sqft respectively and our Presidential Sky Villa is 3983sqft. All these units offer a minimum of 2 bedrooms, an indoor living space and a balcony with a plunge pool. As for the mirror while all the washrooms come with mirrors, unfortunately we do not have full length mirrors in any of our Sky Villas other than the Presidential Sky Villa. 

We are sorry to hear that you found the food to be overpriced and portions to be small. Many of our guests have consistently given us raving reviews about our food and portion sizes, with some guests also noting that pricing is competitive, compared to similar restaurants and cafes in the nearby areas of Hikkaduwa and Galle. Nevertheless, your concerns have been noted and we have flagged this to our Chef for him to look into it as well. 

When it comes to the rooftop pool area, we are sorry that you felt that the area was smaller than advertised. We can confirm that the images we have used in all our marketing are actual images of the property with no enhancements to the proportions. This is visibly evident from posts shared by our guests as well. Our poolside and deck area has been used many times for private events of 30 – 50 people.

The access to the rooftop pool is indeed through the inner deck and restaurant area. However, we do have changing rooms available by the side of the pool showers directly facing the entrance of the pool, for any guests who would like to dry up and change prior to returning to their Sky Villa.

We were surprised to hear about the odor in the room and necessary steps were taken to give you a change of room. After further inquiry into this matter, we have identified that this is an isolated incident relating to that specific room and we have temporarily placed this room out of order until the issue has been fixed. 

On behalf of the team, we would like to apologize for any service delays you have experienced during your stay. We take this very seriously and we have raised this to the senior hotel management in order to take necessary steps to ensure this does not happen again. We are delighted to hear that you were happy with Sajith’s service. We will most definitely pass on your comments to him. 

We believe our team has been in touch with you today and we hope we will have the opportunity to make it up you soon! 

Warm Regards, 
Crystal Sands Team ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"503 Galle Road, Rathgama 80260 Sri Lanka","Rathgama","Sri Lanka","80260",,"503 Galle Road",,"24007036","6.086542","Rathgama, Galle District, Southern Province","80.14506","Crystal Sands","246","4.9","1","0","1","12","232","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13074134-d24007036-Reviews-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.crystal-sands.com","2023-01-24","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Visited this place recently and i am utterly disappointed. The place does not look at all like the pictures they advertised. The entire villa was very small you barely have room inside the bathroom to move. There is no proper long mirror to look at yourself after you get dressed. Food was way overpriced and the portions were very small. Pool area they advertise as if it was a huge area but don’t be fooled by their pictures. Barely 10 people can move around that area. After getting down from the pool we have to walk with our wet clothes through the restaurant to get in to the elevator. Such unprofessional. Only plus thing was the service given by Sajith at the restaurant. The front office and housekeeping staff were not trained properly and they did not have a clue on customer service. I had to call many times to get things done. We were initially put to a room where the bathroom had a bad odor. The i had to call the front office staff and blast at them to get a room change. Please do not visit this horrible place. You can’t even have a swim at the beach because it’s rough.

Hello Anuradha, 

Thank you for having selected to stay at Water Garden Sigiriya. I am writing to express our sincere apologies for the disappointing experience you encountered during your recent stay with us, particularly on what should have been a memorable evening for your honeymoon celebration. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused by a group of guests who had booked multiple villas under our credit card promotion offer. While we strive to treat all guests fairly, we acknowledge that the behavior of this particular group fell short of our usual standards. We understand that the short duration of the noise disturbance affected your romantic dinner celebration and for that we offer our heartfelt apologies.

The party in question had booked 5 villas using the credit card promotion offer that was introduced in September. As an ethical hotel operator we do not discriminate customers who want to book and stay with us, yet I strongly agree with you that the caliber and some behaviours demonstrated by the group in question do not reflect the usual clientele that the hotel attracts. They were informed twice by Duminda, our Restaurant Manager to turn the music down and as they did not pay heed to his request, he called me to assist. 
I immediately went to the poolside and observed that while the majority of the party were in the pool, a few of them were having a drink by the pool bar area. There was a blue tooth speaker which they had brought along and some Sinhala music (not karaoke) was being played. I immediately informed them that we normally do not allow for such activities to be conducted on our premises and asked for the music to be turned down very low. The group were not pleased with my request but did comply. I also asked them to move the direction of the speaker to face the opposite direction (away from pool) and ensured that the music was turned down low. I went back to the restaurant entrance to check if the sound of the music was low and it was. I continued to stay around the pool bar area for app 30 minutes to ensure that they did not turn the volume up again. It needs to be noted that almost all Sri Lankan guests do enjoy using the pool after sunset hours, hence we are flexible with our pool usage hours for all our resident guests as we do not entertain non-resident guests for reasons of privacy and safety. However, I do agree that in these instances we need to be more mindful of the impact on honeymoon couples like yourselves and other inhouse guests dining by the poolside. 
 
I also wish to take this opportunity to assure you and all others that the group involved was not comprised of friends or acquaintances of either mine or any member of the management team of the hotel. We treat all guests equally and do not offer preferential treatment to anyone.  With regard to the steam and sauna facilities, we understand your surprise about the additional charge. We usually do not charge if the said facilities are used in conjunction with a treatment and my apologies that this policy may differ from what you have experienced elsewhere. However, we appreciate your feedback and will consider reviewing this policy in the future.

Once again, we sincerely apologize for failing to meet your expectations during what should have been a joyous occasion. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we will take immediate action to prevent such incidents in the future.

We hope you will give us another opportunity to serve you better and create unforgettable memories during your stay with us. Please do not hesitate to contact me personally if you need anything further.

Congratulations once again on your marriage, and we wish you many years of happiness together.

Sincerely 
David de Silva

The management did not do anything about it despite the several times  I complained to the staff that it’s interrupting my fist dinner after I got married  since these hooligans were having a loud karaoke session near the main pool using their own Speaker . My table was set up near the pool . It was very surprising as to why the hotel even allowed the usage of the pool to these hooligans at night after closing hours. It came to my understanding the above group was known to the general manager of the hotel hence a special allowance for his friends were given to behave in such a manner regardless the disturbance caused to other inhouse guests.

The service is stiff . We need to pay additionaly 10,000 rupees in order to use the steam and sauna to my suprise this is not the case in any hotel I go in the world  .

We at Water Garden Sigiriya were taken completely by surprise with your recent review posted on our site. 
We can only surmise that you have posted your review on our hotel site by mistake instead of the many other hotels whose name contains Water. (ex Water Haven, Water Villa etc)  
All the facts stated in your review does not fit with our hotel operations, facilities and services. I give below the reasons based on your review  

1. Our owner does not contact Guests directly as he owns several hotels (Unlike owner operated small hotels)
2. We checked our Agoda bookings and have no trace of a booking made by you
3. Our phone answering staff are not harsh and arrogant as evidenced by the many 5 star reviews on TripAdvisor
4. Our hotel is easily accessible with the signage placed at important junctions / locations on the road
5. 24th to 26th December we were not full due to the Easter attacks. We did not turn away anyone wanting a room. Many hotels in the area also had free rooms. 
6. We do not have lavatory pits as stated in your review but have a waste water treatment plant to deal with the effluent
7. We do not arbitrarily cancel bookings made by Guests which explains our excellent reputation and high ratings.

In the above light we kindly request you to post your critical review on the correct hotel site that is responsible for the unprofessional acts. Please remove the incorrect post from our site that will mislead future travellers.

If you still maintain that it is indeed Water Garden Sigiriya, we have to question your bona fides and conclude that you are acting on behalf of industry competition to tarnish the excellent 5 star reputation built up on TripAdvisor. 

We have over one hundred and fifty 5 star ratings and only six 4 star ratings during the entire year in 2019. Thank You

However on 24th afternoon i went to the Sigiriya from Galle ( around 300km and 7 hours drive ) with my wife and phoned the hotel to get the direction he said he cancelled the booking. I was so helpless becouse all the hotels of the area was fuuly booked becoz its Christmas eve. The only reason he game me was an elephant damaged the lavotory pit and he has send me an email but i didnt received any. at least he should have been kind enough to gime me call to say that he cancelled my booking rather than stay quite fir three weeks. 
finally I had to drive anuradapura (another 80km ) to fine a hotel and the owner did not worry to say sorry atleast.

We refer to your recent review giving us a one star rating and wish to respond to some of the comments made.
 
At the outset we wish to highlight that you have not made any negative remarks on the villa the food or service or any other aspect of the Hotel. We are glad that the primary services of our hotel have not been negative. I also recall that during the many conversations I had with you during the stay right up to the time of departure you were complimenting every aspect of the Hotel and the services of the staff highly, even naming a few of the top performers. The Guest Relations staff and others also remarked that you were full of praise.  I was therefore rather surprised at the one star rating review that is contrary to the views expressed during your stay. 

Regarding your primary complaint about the weather you will no doubt agree that the weather is a factor beyond anyone’s control. Our Sales department updated you that the weather is gloomy upon your inquiry just before the visit. Further we were fully booked on the weekend of 14th December. Apart from that weekend we could have changed your visit to any other day of your choice. Having decided on the two days convenient to you, it seems unfair to blame the hotel merely for the inconvenience caused by rain. If there were any shortcoming on the food or the service or room cleaning we would be found wanting. In the above backdrop we wish to respectfully disagree with your rating of one star. May we also highlight that we have received over one hundred 5 star reviews this year and have received only six 4 star reviews within the entire year. We do not have any reviews below 4 star levels. Your review is the solitary one star review. We urge you to reconsider your rating in a fair manner based on matters within our control. 
The Security officers have warned the kids not to get into the lakes as they are muddy and are meant for lotus flowers and anyone getting in could easily get stuck in the mud.

As my family lives on just 60 kilometres from your Hotel and as the weather was very cloudy the day we were leaving 9th of December for your hotel and as the weather forecast predicted rain clouds and temperature at 24° in Sigiriya , I telephoned your Sales Team Mr Dilan Morais and conveyed to him the weather looks bad and he replied by saying that he will check with the Hotel and come back to me,which he did so in a few minutes by saying ""it is gloomy"". As rain was predicted I requested him to shift my reservation forward but he replied by saying that the property is full with a Corporate outing over the weekend and conveyed  that the change  was not possible and for him the just 20 persons were more important to him than the Customer who had paid and made the reservation approximately four months before. Having no other option we proceeded to the Hotel and were greeted by overcast skies and the kids opted only for the plunge Pool in the Villa. The second day 10th December was a Total Disaster with  heavy rains from 2 AM in the Morning upto 3 PM in the afternoon and and the kids having a miserable day being confined to the rooms decided to jump into the main pool in the drizzle around 4 PM for about 30 minutes. The next day 11th December in the Morning just before breakfast when the entire family including  the  kids took a walk round the hotel and when all of us approached  a lake with flowing water just near the main entrance adjacent to the Security Point the  kids asked the two Security Officers if they could jump into the water but the two Security Officers loudly shouted back by saying ""don't don't there are three Crocodiles inside which was conveyed by me on checking out to Mr Jan and Mr Suraj Perera as well.

The statement that the management was not helpful is inaccurate, we did conduct a detailed investigation which included searches & you were appraised of the steps taken, the fact that the investigation did not have conclusive evidence that money was stolen was something you were not willing to accept as such we suggested that we inform the police to conduct investigations which they did.

The verbal complaint made to us & your statement that all your bags & suitcases were searched is contradictory. What was informed to the resort was that your suspicion was based on the fact that a bag was  found in a different location from the location that it was originally placed in, our investigation too ascertained this, it was done for reasons of neatness when the room was cleaned.

The statement that we were neither apologetic or concerned is not right, in every instance when we tried to explain you refused to listen & responded with veiled threats that you would inform our other guests if we took no action which you went ahead & did. 
What was the action you expected, did you want us to give you the few currency notes that you reported missing when there was no conclusive evidence that the money was stolen.
If we had given you the money as you probably expected  it would have amounted to us accepting that it was indeed stolen without any conclusive proof to corroborate it.

Your review states that money & valuables were found missing, in your complaint made to us & statements made to the police you stated that  currency notes amounting to 
150 Euro & approximately US $ 240 were only  found missing.

What also leaves us puzzled is why you did not leave your money in the safe provided in the villa. It is a commonly known fact to any traveller to deposit valuables in the safe provided in the accommodation, further when any of our guest are escorted to their villas the safe is pointed out & it's operating instructions clearly explained, this is in addition to the comment on the registration form which you sign on arrival which has a clear comment to deposit your valuables & money in the safe 
If the case was that money deposited in a safe was missing, then there is no question that the resort is liable, which was not so in this instance.

In our two plus years of being in operation this is the first time an allegation of this nature has been levelled at us & we are extremely concerned.

We would be thankful if you could review if the few currency notes reported missing were spent or kept elsewhere.

The sentiment & all it implies is extremely offensive & prejudiced, it leaves us perplexed as to the reasons & motive for the sentiment expressed approximately five months after your stay with us.
Based on details provided in the review the period of the stay was in August & the review is posted in mid January.
 
Further there is also a strong possibility of respect & deference having been misunderstood as a lack of respect. In local culture & specifically when our staff are from rural backgrounds values of respect are instilled in them, a male directly addressing a lady in the presence of her partner is considered impolite & disrespectful & more so pertinent when it is a young honeymoon couple.

The road that leads to the resort is a jungle dirt track which is not paved & very much a part of the natural environment & one cannot expect the road surface of a highway. Does one complain so badly when using a dirt road on a safari ride???
On food there is obviously a difference of opinion between the comments in the review & the extremely positive sentiments expressed on food by over 158 reviews on this forum which leaves us puzzled about the motive of this comment.
We do regret the aspect in relation to the service of wine which has been investigated in detail & addressed, but still feel that isolated incidents like this can happen in any 5 star hotel anywhere in the world and must be looked upon with compassion and understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Indigaswewa, Sigiriya 21120 Sri Lanka","Sigiriya","Sri Lanka","21120",,"Indigaswewa",,"10416524","7.992871","Sigiriya, Central Province","80.745834","Water Garden Sigiriya","1176","4.9","4","3","16","75","1078","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304141-d10416524-Reviews-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html","http://www.watergardensigiriya.com","2017-12-30","OTHER","2",,"Location","3","Cleanliness","4","Service","2",,,,,,,"We stayed here 3 nights as part of a 7 day Sri Lanka tour.

Greetings from Cinnamon Grand Colombo!

We are very sorry to hear about the negative experience you had during your recent stay with us. We sincerely apologize that your room was not ready upon your late arrival and for the issues with the room configuration, including it not being set up for three guests as booked and the stale food found in the fridge. This is certainly not the standard of service we aim to provide, and we understand your frustration and disappointment, especially after a long drive.

We are also concerned to hear that you felt your needs as a lone family traveler were not prioritized. Please be assured that we value all our guests, and we regret that you felt otherwise.
Your feedback is extremely important to us, and we will be taking your comments seriously to review our room preparation processes and ensure such issues are not repeated. We will also address the cleanliness of our rooms, including checking refrigerators, to maintain the standards our guests expect. We hope that you might reconsider in the future, allowing us the opportunity to provide you with the much-improved experience you deserve. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention.

After a four-hour journey to Colombo, we decided to treat ourselves to a 5-star experience for our final night before flying to Singapore early the next morning. Wanting a peaceful stay, we specifically requested a quiet room at check-in.

Despite this, we were placed on the 5th floor, where we were kept awake all night due to a loud party or exhibition happening in the hotel. The noise was unbearable, and we barely slept. This was extremely disappointing, especially given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel.

When we brought this to the attention of the manager, the response was shockingly poor. Instead of any meaningful apology or solution, he offered us free pastries on our way to the airport—hardly adequate compensation for a ruined night’s sleep.

For the price and reputation of this hotel, we expected much better. If you actually want a peaceful and relaxing stay, I’d highly recommend looking elsewhere.

Everything is in utter disorder, there are countless instances to call out but the worst would be the room service experience, check in experience, and basic courtesy from the hotel management.

Under the cover of the festival rush, quality and service standards are majorly compromised by the hotel. Examples: Rooms not ready even till 6 pm, A lower budget category room assigned despite getting paid for a premium category one, 2 out of 3 elevators not working in the old tower, basic amenities missing in the room, 80 mins delivery time for in room dinner, etc 

Highly priced hotel, and fails to match the prices charged. For those who are coming to enjoy the food and drinks at the bar/restaurant are safe I believe. Those who are staying in the hotel, are at mercy. Maybe I am missing something, or maybe the hotel just doesn't care as there is a major demand for the property and they know that the business is going to run on its own, so why to worry at all.","5 Star by price, 2 star by service and hospitality!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r987307859-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Имеет он 5 звезд, но по мне так эти звезды только за то что это центр Коломбо и за окна во всю стену.  Заселились мы втроем, в номере кровать одна. Сразу спустилась на ресепшн объяснила на английском, что  хочу и почему.  Сказали принесут кровать. Сразу отмечу с английским у ребят не очень, половину слов недоговаривают, ударения невпопад, про русский вообще молчу. Поэтому сразу 2 человека на ресепшн пытались мне ответить, все закончилось моим повторением на английской и их ответами да или нет. Четыре раза ходила на ресепшн, чтобы попросить кровать в течении 5 часов. Создалось впечатление, что они и сами друг друга не понимают. Кровать принесли, поставили в проходе.  Номер небольшой,  мебель не новая, кран с горячей водой плохо открывался и закрывался, в номере ванна. 2 лифта с нерабочими кнопками, в одном не показывает на каком ты этаже. Доступная для прогулок территория маленькая: бассейн, огород, пруд с рыбками, ступеньки-водопад. Ели в ресторане plates вроде еды много, но не вкусная, по сравнению с нашим предыдущим отелем еда разочаровала, хотя повторю очень большое разнообразие есть крабы, мидии, роллы, проход в ресторан через огромный красивый приемный зал вниз по ступенькам без указателей. Пляж в 8 км от отеля, в 1,5 км от отеля городской парк с набережной. Напротив посо��ьства, где стоят люди с автоматами в камуфляже. Делясь впечатлениями с остальными поняла, что всех кого заселяли по трое заселяли с одной кроватью изначально. У кого-то не было полотенец в номере, также просили несколько раз на ресепшн. Был номер рядом где слетала дверь с петель. У нас и по крайней мере еще в одном номере размагничивались карточки-ключи. В баре через переводчик на телефоне на синегальском общение с проблемами. По выезду у нас был перенос трансфера,  с 8:30 до 9:30 никто ничего не сообщил, пошли по номерам с табличкой на английском уже около 9 часов. Информацию, которую не нашла на сайтах: ужин - с 7 часов, завтрак - с 6:30, обеда у нас не было не знаю.","Бизнесс отель","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r958354472-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to review us following your recent stay with us. Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of the team for the disappointing experience you encountered during your recent stay. Your feedback is incredibly important to us, and we regret that we fell short of meeting your expectations, especially during such a significant occasion as your honeymoon and your husband's birthday.

We understand your frustration regarding the delay in the check-in process. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused by this delay. We want to clarify that the delay was due to the necessity to upgrade your booked category upon your request, which required some additional time to accommodate properly.

While we strive to maintain a pest-free environment, it's important to note that the presence of insects and mosquitoes is often inevitable in a tropical country like ours. However, please be assured that we have rigorous pest control measures in place to minimize their impact on our guests.

Additionally, we apologize for any miscommunication regarding the availability of an SUV for your transportation needs. While we had communicated the non-availability of an SUV, we did offer an alternative vehicle choice of a van. However, we understand that this alternative was not suitable for your requirements, and we regret any inconvenience this may have caused.

Greetings from Jetwing Saman Villas!

Please accept my sincere apologies for the delay in arranging the refund to your account. While refunds do take a considerable amount of time to be processed and finalized, there had been a setback and a communication lapse that resulted in a delay in the process. Nonetheless, I can assure you that it is being worked on and will be resolved within the next few days.

Thank you for understanding, and we regret the inconvenience caused by this infrequent delay on our part.

I sincerely hope that this will not deter you from engaging with us in the future.

On the second day the reviewer wanted an early departure with a refund for the third night. In terms of the conditions of the reservation early cancellation is not permitted. The reviewer was visibly disappointed and we regret we could not waive cancellation charges. 

The reviewer’s main grievance as described in the review was “Beaches are not fit for swimming due to rough seas even though hotel promotes pristine beaches which misleads travelers”. It is true we have described the beach as “pristine” but that does not by any stretch of imagination describe the condition of the sea. Sea is dynamic and the condition varies with the weather. During the reviewers stay tourists were swimming in the sea on both sides of the hotel. 

Hotel website features the room exactly as is and without any exaggeration. This is the first occasion that any guest has complained that the photos appear better than the actual state of the room. The hotel is frequently renovated and well maintained. 

The reviewer booked on the hotel website where daily room rates are given for both high and low seasons. Reviewer was therefore aware that this was the high season in Sri Lanka and prices during this time are higher than the low season. Our high season prices are comparable to similar hotels.         

The reviewer has not been fair in rating the hotel “one bubble”.

The hotel website clearly indicates that privacy may not be available in Deluxe Suites with Pools. The notice on the website reads as ""The swimming pools are for private use for the occupants of the suites. Privacy of the swimming pools cannot be guaranteed as the swimming pools are out doors and may be seen by other guests. If you require a higher level of privacy and luxury we recommend that you book the Grand Deluxe Suite with Pool or for ultimate privacy and luxury the Saman Villa Suite with Pool""

Our suites are housed in 2 story villas with 2 suites to a villa. The images and description clearly describes that there are 2 suites to a villa. In view of low season the number of guests were very low. The reviewers main concern at the hotel was having to pay extra for a 3rd person and the hotel housing another guest in the suites above the reviewers suite. With occupancy being low we should not have allocated another guest on top of the reviewers suite and we deeply apologize for our insensitivity. It was by no means intentional.

We are surprised with the reviewers comments made about breakfast and in general about our food as almost every guest has praised the quality and standard of our food. The breakfast consists of a selection including Sri Lankan, Saman Villas Signature, American , Slim & Trim. There is a separate a la carte lunch and snack menu which offer a range of 60 menu Items. The a la carte dinner menu offers a selection of 56 menu items.  The extensive range of cuisine coupled with 5 private dining locations  offer our guests ample choice even though we only have one main restaurant.

Saman Villas cannot be compared to a 5 star hotel. Saman Villas is a 27 suite deluxe boutique resort & spa offering an authentic experience. To ensure a high level of service we maintain a high staff ratios with 4 staff per suite. Our service has been praised by many other guests on Trip Advisor. 
 

The reviewer has failed to understand the concept of the hotel prior to making the booking. Had the reviewer visited the website and understood the concept, the  reviewer would have opted to choose another hotel.

Hotel has a very strict child policy where children below 10 years are not allowed due to safety and privacy reasons. This restriction is clearly and prominently mentioned in the hotels website as well as on online booking engines. Potential guests are not able to book a 3rd person/ child in any of the suites as the system will not process the reservation. Reviewer had made the booking via Expedia for two adults without mentioning a 3rd person. Upon arrival the hotel had to decline check-in. The agitated reviewer was not willing to respect the hotel policy and stated that Expedia website did not have a child policy displayed on their site. The hotel showed the child policy displayed on the Expedia site and also showed that Expedia had disabled the reservation function where booking a 3rd person/child could not be booked. Reviewer was not willing to accept the hotel policy and demanded check-in. The General Manager had also explained same to the guest. 

Reviewer had reserved for 2 nights and based on the hotels cancellation policy, hotel has the right to charge both nights. As a goodwill gesture the hotel offered to wave 50% of cancellation fees. Reviewer demanded for a full refund and started verbally abusing the staff for not letting him check-in. The Front Office Manager did not assault or even verbally abuse the reviewer, but only pleaded the reviewer to calm down. It was the Front Office Manager who helped the reviewer to find an alternate hotel. The reviewer was not willing to claim down and continued verbally abusing the  Front Office Manager and the rest of the staff. The  reviewer was uncontrollable and started shouting in abusive language using profanity and walking around public areas. We were compelled to ask the reviewer to leave the premises due to his indecent behavior.

The child policy was implemented in  2005  and in the recent past we have had only a few experiences , where guests arrive with children below 10 years. In these instances guests have understood and respected the policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2016-09-07","OTHER","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well, I had the most insane experience at the Saman Villas.

Then I asked them to give this to me in writing so atleast I had some proof and could take it up at a later stage, the blatantly refused.  Then so as no to loose approximately USD 800 I attempted to take a video of the manager, telling him that I need some evidence of this matter at which point Amithe assaulted me and threatened me that this is not India and is Sri Lanka.

All suites offer magnificent views of the ocean. The reviewer had no reason to leave as the hotel offered suitable and adequate options.  

We treat our guests equally regardless of the number of visits. While we try our very best to accommodate guest requests when allocating suites, we cannot always offer specific room numbers.

The issue of not been able to allocate specific room numbers are not a reflection of unreliable or poor service of the management. A service can only be evaluated upon experiencing a stay and not associating it with a particular room number.

We are very surprised with the review and rating, especially when over 93% of  guests have praised the hotel and rated very good and excellent.

We analyzed the reasons that provoked the reviewer to post such a review.  The reviewer had booked a 3 night stay and wanted to cancel the last night and demanded for a full refund of the last night. Since the management could not comply with the reviewers late request, the reviewer fabricated a false story to disrepute the hotel and mislead all readers.

Saman Villas does not offer the standard luxuriousness similar to what can be seen in large five star hotels. The concept and design are derived from ancient Sri Lankan temple architecture with rustic elegance elements, combined with modern conveniences. Saman Villas depicts a typical deluxe boutique resort and spa that is very Sri Lankan.  

For the benefit of prospective visitors to this site we are giving below the true picture;

ARRIVAL  EXPERIENCE
As  you enter the gates of Saman Villas you will proceed to the arrival pavilion from the car porch and a staff member awaits your arrival to welcome you. As you walk in, you will only hear the sounds of the gushing waters; an oversized pond with a floating timber walkway that leads to the spa and a water feature surrounded by large trees and thick vegetation. The pond is created to appear black in colour so that trees and vegetation reflects on water and creates a serene ambiance as you walk by the pathway at the edge of the pond to the craft pavilion. 

The craftsman awaits you at the craft pavilion and welcomes by garlanding you with a handmade Gok-Art (young coconut leaves) garland. You will be escorted to the reception across a timber bridge over cascading water. 

The water and the pond is by no means “ grey, murky and cloudy” as described by the reviewer. To ensure clarity of water in the pond, the water is filtered via a sand filter. 

THE AMBIANCE 
Reference to “long dark and gloomy walkways that had bare walls” ;a massive exaggeration by the reviewer. With just a 15 second walk through a short stairway, your landing place will open your eyes to some of the most magical views of the ocean and shoreline.

The landing place leads to you the main bar on your right-side by the infinity edge pool. The Lounge Bar is not a typical bar where bottles are displayed. The bar has been created for guests to appreciate the views of the infinity edge pool and ocean while enjoying their drinks. A special hand crafted art work made out of wood depicting water, sea, fish and birds adorns the backdrop of the Lounge Bar. The landing area then leads you to the Main Restaurant on to you left-side boasting panoramic views from the north shoreline to the south shoreline.  As you walk through the restaurant you will see a large terracotta mural depicting a Perahera (procession) similar to the Kandy Perahera.

THE SUITES
The website clearly explains the type of luxury the hotel offers “A modern-day interpretation of Sri Lankan culture and style, 26 suites and the duplex villa offer casual luxury in the form of soft linens and homely furniture”.  The reviewer has misinterpreted “luxuriousness”. The website also states that all suites offer open-air bathrooms and outdoor rain showers. The reviewer has failed to understand and appreciate the concept which other reviewers describe it as a “bathroom to die for”. There are no issues with mosquitoes as mosquito eliminators as placed in the bathrooms, balconies/veranda’s and bedrooms. We agree with the reviewer that the main sliding door does not fully seal. In keeping with the design and decor we opted for solid wood sliding doors instead of aluminum doors which would have sealed well. Mosquitoes have never been an issue in the rooms, though exaggerated by the reviewer.  
The swing doors were introduced by the architect after careful thought. The intention was to separate the dressing room and bedroom with least inconvenience to guests. The standard practice would have been to have a door to separate the dressing room and bedroom inconvenience guests to open and close each time they pass by. The swing doors with free movement is more convenient to guests.

We provide Daikin invertor type air-conditioning units. Two whisper quite indoor units are placed in each suite to have improve air distribution. The units do not make any howling sound as described by the reviewer. Both air-conditioning units may be operated at a very low speed with a comfortable temperature rather than managing with one unit at a higher speed and lower temperature.  

The reviewer had failed to understand and appreciate the concept of the hotel. The review does not comment on any experiential aspects such as food, service, staff etc…which are vital elements of a holiday. The reviewers only objective was to cause disrepute to the hotel as the management was not able to refund a last minute cancellation.

I was dumb struck from the moment I stepped into the complex wondering if I had come to the right address. It was grey and murky the water features from the main gate were cloudy and very unpleasant to look at. The main building was accessed through a long dark and gloomy walkway that had bare walls and nothing to soften the spaces. The bar area looked like a scene from a 1970's play with a few bottles on a shelf in another un inviting  space. Then we were shown to our supposed luxurious  bedroom There was absolutely nothing luxurious, the furniture was a mismatch and badly placed there were saloon style doors into the dressing area and the bathroom had an open cage roofed area perfect for the mossies to get in and wait for us to enter.  The decor in the bathroom was also dreadful a confused mix of 'styles' and the cage roof made it feel dirty because of the plant debris hanging and dried on it. The sliding room doors didn't fit leaving huge gaps at the sides again letting in the mossies. The view was however amazing and the sound of the waves wonderful until we put on the air conditioning unit. It sounded like a howling wind and ruined any natural soothing wave sound. The noise from the apartment above was also intrusive we could hear them walking backwards and forwards. 
I have stayed in better hostels. Don't be fooled by the right up in the lonely planet they cannot have been here since it originally opened. It's DREADFUL. If they were charging US$200 a night I would have been upset so being charged over US$600  I felt totally ripped off.

We generally close the hotel for short periods to carry out refurbishment work as we do not want our guests been disturbed, however general maintenance work such as painting is carried out several times during the year due to the heavy sea breeze. 

May to end July is considered as low season on the south west coast, and our guests have the option of making use of the best offers during this period. Despite the seasonality the service offered to guests remains unchanged. We regret to note the reviewers comments about our staff been board and unenthusiastic. The overall rating and comments on staff and service is rated very highly. This is evident by the reviews posted by other reviewers on TripAdvisor.

Saman Villas undergoes a major refurbishment every 4-5 years and the last major refurbishment was in 2010 covering all suites and public areas. Saman Villas simply cannot be compared to a five star hotel; the concept and design is derived from ancient Sri Lankan temple architecture with rustic elegance elements, combined coupled with modern conveniences. Saman Villas is a typical deluxe boutique resort and spa with 27 suites spread out in over 3 acres on land and surrounded by lush green vegetation, we offer an intimate and personal experience to guests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2013-09-01","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","2","Sleep Quality","1","We booked this hotel for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon.  The reviews we read were great.  The location is great.  I have to warn other travellers however, that you need to pick your time carefully.  We went out of season.  Which usually is not a problem for Sri Lanka.  Generally good weather and service still good.  Unfortunately this was not the case for Samman Villas.  We went there in July.  The staff were bored and unenthusiastic.  Lots of renovation work going on.  I have to add we payed full rate so it was not like they had an excuse.  Manger really not very helpful.

The rooms are now dated compared to other five star hotels

So my advice would be to go in peak season.  I wonder if previous good reviews have made them lazy.  We stayed in 4 other hotels during our stay.  This was no were near the best so don't feel that this is must for all those looking for a bit of luxury. 

The Spa is very good and reasonable price for treatments.","Off season don't bother","2013-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r175087378-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The same reviewer had posted 2 false reviews previously regarding claimed stays at Saman Villas with the subjects “Interesting what happened...” on 13th April 2013 and  “Sigh....this is a sad place!” on 7th March 2013. These reviews were subsequently removed by Tripadvisor presumably because the reviewer had failed to verify their stays at Saman Villas

Our executive team speaks to all guests during their stay. The Manager speaks to every guest other than when he is on leave. With just 27 suites we know all our guests. Every Monday our executive team conducts a meeting to discuss and exchange notes of the comments made by guests who departed during the previous week. Whenever a review appears on Tripadvisor the team of executives discusses the favourable and unfavorable comments. With the procedure we follow, suspicious reviews are easily identifiable. The current review which states that the reviewer stayed in February 2013 as a couple is a false statement as we did not have such guests staying with us. The review “Sigh....this is a sad place!” posted on 7th March 2013 states that the reviewer stayed as a family in January 2013 which again is a false statement as we did not have such guests staying with us. We have checked our records and have not had any repeat guests staying with us from Germany in February 2013.

It is obvious that the reviewer is not objectively reviewing the hotel, but with ulterior motives. The reviewer initially rates the hotel 3/5 in their review “Sigh....this is a sad place!” on 7th March 2013. Since the review was suspicious the management reported to Tripadvisor. After the verification process Tripadvisor had removed the review. The reviewer re-submits a review “Interesting what happened...”  on 13th April 2013 once again giving a rating of 1/5 which was again removed by Tripadvisor on 16th April 2013.

We take both negative and positive comments constructively, but we do not tolerate reviews which are not genuine.

Tripadvisor as the name implies, is a travel advisory site. It provides a forum for both travelers and hotel owners. Tripadvisor encourages owners to respond to negative comments.

Last time we decided to spend a few nice days (and a lot of Euro) in Saman Villas since its location seemed incredible wonderful.  Unfortunately we discovered fast that yes, the location is good, at least towards the ocean (you have to pass some sewage smelling area before you enter the gate) but the rest of the hotel did not make us crazy at all. We missed a hand and love for details which makes a hotel in this category so special -- but there is close to nothing. We did not like the lighting & fixtures in the rooms, the tiles around the pool (the fact that the poolboy washes the mould into the poolwater, yak!) and many other sad corners who are just dark or sad or in our opinion just not pretty. It is NOT a happy place and if you are a person with a sense for style, you find in southeast asian hotels,  this is not your place. I am sorry!

We will therefore, first explain the facts leading to the cancellations. The party of 5 including the driver arrived having “travelled for 10 hours straight” (sic), without an advance reservation. The most worked and tired person in the group was obviously the driver. After making payment in confirmation of the rooms Valentino 333888, Paris, France requested free accommodation for the driver in separate quarters, which we do not provide. Other guests to Saman Villas provide their drivers accommodation in many guest houses in Bentota or sometimes in our guest rooms paying the very low Sri Lankan rate so that the driver gets a night’s rest in comfort. The reviewer thought of a free option. Give him a pillow and a bed sheet “so he can crash in the van” (sic). The executive who was  woken up to help the Receptionist to  sort out the commotion decided, very correctly, to lose US$ 1,500 in sales rather than be a party to an inhuman act. In fact it is in keeping with our principles of responsible tourism (please see hotel website) that we do not provide free drivers quarters. Our policy compels drivers to be accommodated in comfort in a nearby guest house providing additional income to the guest houses operated by the local community. We ask the readers of this review whether they know of any hotel in Paris, Valentino 333888’s city, which provides free drivers accommodation or bed sheets and pillows so that drivers “can crash in the van” (sic).
The Valentino 333888 from Paris says “If in fact this were my employees I would fire them immediately” (sic). Sorry sir, we have to be humane, our staff have families to support. We cannot fire employees the way you do, we have procedures.
It is true Sri Lankan hotels have 2 rates, one for Sri Lankans and resident visa holders and another for foreigners. Nothing to do with skin colour as the reviewer has said. Over 94% of visitors to Saman Villas are foreigners, simply because Sri Lankans cannot afford the very high foreign rate. Valentino 333888 tried to pressure the Receptionist to give him the benefit of the lower rate and failed. Now he is criticizing the policy.
There are numerous exaggerations, too many to deal with. A glaring exaggeration is the 78 plus 35 telephone calls, a total of 113. At the rate of 1 minute per call and allowing for all other activities in the review, a fair estimate would be 2 hours and 30 minutes. According to entry and departure times recorded by security the guests have spent exactly 1 hour and 2 minutes in the hotel premises. Need we say more? We will leave it to visitors to this website to determine the level of exaggeration.
In conclusion, the review “Disgrace” with a rating of 1 out of 5 is a real disgrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2013-01-06","OTHER","1",,"Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","1",,,,,"The four of us had travelled for 10 hours straight and arrived in Bentota looking for a hotel and based on the ratings of this hotel TRIED to check in.  This is where the clown show began:
We were initially told that they had 2 rooms, but wait now there is only one, but wait let me call someone, yes 2 rooms, no 1 room and after showing us each room individually (which looked amazing!) we proceeded back to the reception to check in. Now what you have to realize is that in Sri Lanka there are 2 prices: one for Locals or Sri Lankas and or  Dual Citizens, and one for Foreigners, so based on your skin color you basically pay double, triple, quadruple whatever times more...no bid deal right? well if we did this in the western world it would be a lawsuit and called racism but here its just the Norm.  So since there were 3 dual citizens and one Foreigner (me) we usually in our travels would get the local rate and it wouldn't be a discussion at all, HOWEVER at this hotel they needed to make 78 phone calls in the middle of the night to ask who knows who about their PROCEDURE...you see here a Procedure is basically what somebody tells someone without any thought involved whatsoever..its basically the ""way things are"" doesn't matter if it makes sense or anything logical at all...so 45 minutes later some supposed Manager showed up and made some more phone calls and eventually said ok ok this time I can do it...in other words they are doing us a favor by spending $800 for the night...huffing and puffing taking my credit card...oh and this is where it gets exciting:  we asked if they had drivers quarters and they informed us that they don't do that 'HERE'...I said ok is it possible to get a pillow for our driver so he can crash in the van? and they said ""in this type of establishment we don't even give 'them' coffee....."" can you imagine this attitude????  I basically snapped and told them to give me my refund back and that I would not stay in a place such as this with this type of attitude...I had enough....now you see the Credit Card machine was all of a sudden broken!! sure it was...another 35 phone calls later (and 2am by now) they finally figured out that the manager in fact was incompetent (although she blamed it all on the machine).  I threatened to go to the police at this point as they were now not giving me my money back and sure enough it now worked miraculously...
NOW I did not stay at this hotel and it sure looked very very nice, however when people treat other humans as lower then them I refuse to give them my money and I leave it up to you whether you should stay in a hotel such as this.  My final comments were: you just lost $1500 in sales (as we planned 2 nights) and they basically said:  ""WE DON'T CARE"" ....this are words of a failing business and if in fact this were my employees I would fire them immediately...","Disgrace","2013-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r148958700-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We regret we have failed to satisfy the reviewer in all areas except location.

Our responses to the reviewer’s comments are:

1.	Reviewer says “We paid close to USD 800 per night for a superior room”

The internet rate for the period 22nd December to 9th January (19 days) is USD 580 plus service charge and government tax which amounts to USD 735 per room night. Some agents offer lower rates. We are surprised that the reviewer bought the room from an agent for USD 800, USD 65 more than the internet rate. Our advice is please check the internet rate and buy at the lowest.

It is true that the reviewer booked in November one of the last available rooms. Demand is very high during this period. We have only 27 rooms and we had to turn down 6 requests for rooms for the same period.

Our rates vary throughout the year. In fact there are 7 different rate periods depending on many factors such as holiday season, weather, festivities, demand, etc. The cheapest in 2012 was from 1st May to 15th July at USD 266 and most expensive from 22nd December 2012 to 9th January 2013 at USD 735. The latter is the only period we could not meet the demand and hence the high rate is justifiable. Our rate structure is flexible to the extent that a traveler can have a very cheap holiday at USD 266 per night or pay USD 735 per night during the 19 day peak period. We also have numerous value added offers. Please visit our website for rates and special offers or contact us.

2.	Reviewer says “On new years eve, a party started on the beach near our room. It was noise from another hotel and was so loud it was as though we were in the room together”

The aerial photograph of the hotel in the website shows a general impression of the location. There are no hotels nearby except the ayurvedic treatment centre behind the hotel which may be identified from the green coloured roof. On 31st night a band was playing at a small 6 bedroom hotel abutting the highway but with a beach front, known as Warahena. The distance from Room 24 occupied by the reviewer to the Warahena Hotel is between 1200 and 1300 feet. Any future visitor to Saman Villas may verify this. There is no truth whatsoever in the statement “party started on the beach near our room” (sic).

It is a practice in Sri Lanka and many other countries to celebrate New Year’s Eve. Almost all tourist hotels have entertainment with music for dancing. At Saman Villas the band played till 1.40 am. At Warahena it was over at 2.45 am.

On 31st night in 2011 and 2012 music was played at Warahena Hotel and could be heard at Saman Villas. On both nights the hotel was full. In 2011 no one complained and in 2012 only the reviewer complained. It is not that others did not hear the music. It may be that they did not find it disturbing or they were appreciative of the fact that it is a once a year celebration.

Hotels pay compensation if a facility in a guest room or elsewhere in the hotel is withdrawn. No compensation is paid for anything not within the control of hotel management.

The reviewer complained to me and requested compensation, but there was no basis to justify any payment. The reviewer was adamant. All this was making their holiday unpleasant and  to  save  their holiday I offered a refund of 25%. This was a gesture of goodwill simply to help the reviewer and her husband to enjoy their holiday, but to no avail.

3.	Other complaints in the review

Our responses are:

a. 	Lizard in the room – A common house gecko about 3” long was found in the room. Geckos have suction pads on their feet and they can move fast on walls and ceilings. It is almost impossible to catch them. It may have entered the room from the open air balcony or verandah. Geckos are harmless creatures.

b. 	Two short power cuts – There was a failure in the government power supply on 2nd January from 18.52 hrs to 19.15 hrs.  When this happens the generator automatically starts off after a delay of about 30 seconds. When power returns the automatic changeover is very much quicker. These very short interruptions are not power cuts.

c. 	The reviewer has made many complaints about service. Visitors to this site may read all reviews in 2012 and decide whether our service is bad.

The pictures on the website show an aerial photo of an attractive hotel sitting alone on a rocky headland jutting out to the sea. It looks as though there are no other hotels around it. The room was one of the last rooms available when we booked it in November for a late December stay, so the price was hyper inflated. The entrance to the hotel is relatively promising, looking like top class hotels we have stayed in throughout Asia in Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines etc. How wrong we were....

The catalogue of errors began with the service. It was extraordinarily slow, in the restaurant, reception, pool, in-room etc. Even with the restaurant half full or us being a handful of people to dine there. Upon reading other reviews, we have to agree with those who mentioned the staff linger for a little too long which feels uncomfortable and unnecessary. On many occasions, we asked for two items, only one turned up or was incorrect which became quite tiring after a while.

On new years eve, a party started on the beach near our room. It was noise from  another hotel and was so loud it was as though we were in the room together. We gave it until 1.30 am before calling reception 6 times, each time the line rang out. My husband (who was unwell at the time and needed rest due to the anti biotics he was taking) got out of bed to speak to reception. When he reached reception, there was someone manning the desk! He complained and was told it would stop at 2.30, which it didn't. He called again and was advised they would call the tourist police. The music stopped eventually at 4 am. We complained to the front desk manager the following day and said we didn't wish to pay for a night where we did not sleep. The manager said it was another hotel that caused the issue and it wasn't their fault. It was shocking that he didn't try to help, except eventually offering us 10 per cent off that night, a nominal figure. The receptionist offered a 2 hour treatment at the spa on top and asked us to write a letter to the authorities to complain. It wasnt accepted by us and we asked to speak to the general manager who we met with the following day and said it wasn't his fault. Our argument was that if they know there is a regular occurrence of such parties, then why let rooms out on that side of the hotel? Also, they asked us to move to the other side of the hotel, the front desk manager said it was because a new years day party may happen, the general manager advised it was because it was a quieter room. The general manager offered 25 per cent off that night as a final gesture and when we stood our ground, he said he'd speak to the chairman. It eventually ended with us advising we wanted to speak to the chairman but this didn't happen, we were told he would email us......

In the new room, there was a lizard which we asked to be removed. The staff tried with a pencil and it ran up the wall. It appeared again the next day. Again, the staff tried to remove it with haphazard ways and said it was gone only for it to reappear at night.

The rooms were below par, again echoing the comments in other reviews of this hotel. They certainly werent furnished in a way that justifies paying $800 a night. The wi fi was very poor, even though we had been to other parts of the coastwhere it was better so it wasnt a coastal issue. The bathrooms weren't cleaned every day, the bed was made and the room swept but it wasn't cleaned at all, in fact there was hair in the plug hole until we removed it. The tv in e second room had very poor reception and couldn't be controlled from bed. When leaving the hotel to go elsewhere it was visibly frowned upon, with e front office staff saying we needed to walk outside the property to get a tuk tuk instead of helping us. There were 2 short power cuts on our last evening. There was dried in blood on a duvet cover and a black mark on our pillow case which we had to have changed. Also, for our first breakfast, we were charged for a bottle of water at an all inclusive breakfast! Along with the fact as a beach hotel, there are no sun loungers on the beach and no possibility of service on the beach should the staff put some loungers down there. The owner of the hotel visited top notch resorts in asia when he was building this hotel. I can see how he may have tried to mirror those styles within this hotel, but it falls short, feeling like Aldi mimicking Marks and Spencer but doing a bad job of it. It's not plush, not worth the extortionate amount charged for the standard rooms. Overall a most unpleasant experience and a hotel that falls in to the bottom grading of the various top notch hotels I've stayed in over the years. These complaints are not new to the management of the hotel, who continue to defend themselves on this site in a most aggressive and unpleasant manner, instead of changing their ways.","3 star quality at 5 star prices","2013-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r148698748-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",
,"8","127459534",,"en","306376",,"General Manager","128150019","en","2012-04-18","Kenneth L","We thank the reviewer for their stay at Saman Villas. We are delighted to read the reviewer’s very favorable comments regarding the friendly / delightful staff, excellent people, beautiful location, small and exclusive resort and the excellent menu. However, the overall rating of two out of five given by the reviewer is influenced by some of the negative comments in the review. Our explanations on the negative comments are discussed below:-

1.	Transfer from Airport to Hotel.
	The reviewer has raised two issues.

	a.	Breakdown of vehicle 
	b.	That US$ 125 is a very high fare for Sri Lanka.

We profusely apologize to the reviewer  for the breakdown of the vehicle. Immediately it was brought to my notice I waived the entire charge of the transfer. 

We cannot agree at all with the reviewer’s comment that for Sri Lanka US$ 125 is a very high fare. We did  a comparison of a transfer from the Heathrow Airport to London by taxi with the rate we charged.At Heathrow if you wait in the queue for a taxi it will cost you US$ 89 to transfer to London, a distance of 28 km which takes about 30 minutes. In comparison the transfer time from the Airport to the hotel is approximately 3 hours or 6 times that in London.The distance that has to be covered is 92 km which is 3.3 times the distance in London. If you  extrapolate (disregarding the time taken which is  6 times) a charge of US$ 294 for transfer to Saman Villas is reasonable, of course assuming that vehicle prices and  cost of fuel etc are similar. A sub-compact car  like Toyota Corolla manufactured about 2007  will cost about US$ 28,000 a fortune in Sri Lanka. This is no surprise because Sri Lanka charges one of the highest duty rates in the world for motor cars. A similar used car can be purchased at about US$ 14,900 in London. Gas station price in the U.K is US$ 2.16 per litre whereas in Sri Lanka it is US$ 1.15. You can do your own arithmetic and you will come to the conclusion that a charge of at least US$ 250  is not unreasonable. Our charges are as follows:-

	Sub-compact vehicle						                US$ 125
	Semi luxury car						 	                US$ 200
	Luxury (Mercedes Benz or Chrysler 300 C)			US$ 460

The above prices are inclusive of 10% service charge and 15.2% government tax.

Is it fair for any one to complain that our transfer rates are high? It is very unfortunate that a very few  tourists think Sri Lanka  which is a developing country should sell everything cheap. We sometimes  receive similar complaints about wine prices. If   anyone  compares one of the most widely sold wines (Moet & Chandon) in a 4 or 5 star hotel in London or anywhere else in the world  they will find our price is very  reasonable. Wines are considered a luxury in Sri Lanka and therefore attract very high duty. Quantities imported into Sri Lanka are insignificant and as a result import prices are very much higher than in UK or Europe.

2.	Pool Villas are far from Private
There is often confusion between the English words “private” and “privacy”. We use the meanings given in the Oxford Dictionary and therefore it is best to refer the meanings given there. We have given all the necessary information  correctly in our website. We have 4 categories of rooms on the ground floor.

Deluxe Suite without pool selling at US$ 342

Deluxe Suite with pool selling at US$ 394.For the addition of a pool which is described in the website as “7 meter infinity edge lap pool overlooking the Indian Ocean for your private use” we charge only additional US$ 52 on Deluxe Suite price.

For an additional US$ 172 we offer the Grand Deluxe with a pool which is  described in our website as “7 meter secluded lap pool overlooking the Indian Ocean with sun deck and dining area for your private use”.

For an additional US$ 272 we offer the Villa (duplex with floor area 1,261 sq.ft)  where the pool is described as “ 7 meter secluded lap pool with sun deck and sun loungers for your private use in privacy”

The above rates quoted are from our website as at 19th April 2012. 10% service charge and 15.2% government taxes should be added.

Our website clearly explains the difference and what it cost to get absolute privacy. In the circumstance we cannot understand why the reviewer has complained.

3.	We were charged 2 nights cancellation

Reviewer’s argument is that although they complained about the mattress the cancellation charge which they agreed to at the time  of reservation was not waived. We cannot accept  that there is a problem with the mattress as claimed by the reviewer. During this year there are 40 reviews in Trip Advisor and no guest has complained about  an inadequacy in the mattress. We do waive cancellation charges for very good reasons only. Otherwise the guest must honour the contract. This is the practice followed in any hotel in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2012-04-08","OTHER","2",,"Value","1","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","4","Service","4","Sleep Quality","1","First, the positives. The staff at Saman were delightful, friendly and not at all over-attentive. Excellent people. The location is beautiful and the resort is small and exclusive.

The hotel charges $125 for a transfer from the airport. This is a very high fare for Sri Lanka. I was happy to pay it if some kind of luxury would be on offer, as I have experienced at other high-end resorts, usually involving a comfortable car with bottles of water and cold towels supplied. Unfortunately the vehicle was an old Hyundai, which was very shabby inside. There was bottled water.....for the driver! After half an hour the engine lights came on and the car ground to a halt. The driver managed to get it going again but we couldn't use the air conditioning. Great in Sri Lanka! A bit later the driver decided that a/c would be available so we limped in to Saman at a snails pace on a wing and a prayer. Not a great start to our break and the manager immediately waived the fee (of course!)
A word about the pool villas. We had booked a deluxe with pool and looked forward to some privacy there. To quote Saman villas policy ""(The) concept has always attracted travelers seeking private luxury holidays in an undisturbed atmosphere with maximum privacy."" Well all the pool villas' pools are far from private as they are overlooked by at least two of the apartments plonked on top of the ""Pool Villas"". You are like performing seals for the occupants above! Again, I expected a private pool as in other resorts I have stayed in but was disappointed.
My wife and I have to disagree with a previous contributor about the bed. Or maybe we just had the worst one at the resort? It was as hard as a brick with lumps and springs felt through it. After one night we asked for a duvet and mattress protector to go on top of it. But when we were both awake early and taking pain-killers for our backs the next morning, we decided enough was enough. It was time to book out and find some comfort somewhere else, as all the management could offer was more blankets on top of the lumpy mattress!
We were charged two nights cancellation fee. This was the first time at any hotel I have stayed in around the world, where there was a punitive fee for checking out due to the inadequacies of the hotel! Shocking.
They try (hard) to portray themselves as an exclusive resort but fail on many counts.

The reviewer stayed 6 nights at Saman Villas and during their stay they had only one complaint . That was only  about WiFi, which we will explain later.

Reviewer’s main complaint was regarding a charge of US$ 30 for breakfast per person. He says “we were led to believe breakfast was included”. The reservation was made online through our website. Any one can visit our website and click on “Book Now” on the Menu Bar. It will be very clear that room rates do not include breakfast and an additional US$ 24 has to be paid for breakfast. Both room and breakfast rates are special discounted rates for internet reservations and are very much lower than rack rates offered at the hotel. At the time of check-in the reviewer was very clearly informed by the Guest Relations Executive that the breakfast rate is US$ 30 at the restaurant. They had breakfast on all six days and it was charged  correctly to their account. At check-out they refused to pay the charge for breakfast. Twice, not once, they threatened to walk out without settling the bill. The General Manager had to come down interrupting an important meeting to persuade the reviewer to settle the bill. The reviewer then threatened to write a terrible review in the Trip  Advisor. True, it was a nightmare for the Guest Relations Executive.

Our comments on the reviewer’s other complaints are:

1.	Their crappy site. In the end I could not book through their site.

For online reservations we use a facility used by many hotels worldwide. This company has its corporate office in New York and reservation facility is maintained from Melbourne, Australia.

The booking was in fact made online through our website.

2.	Staff training and numerous other comments about staff.

We leave it to our future guests to evaluate our staff. We take regular staff training very seriously and we are the only boutique hotel in Sri Lanka with its own onsite purpose built training facility.

3.	Poor WiFi Service

We agree with the reviewer that our Wi Fi facility is poor. It is not 56 kbps as alleged. The problem is that Saman Villas is located in a very  sparsely  populated area described as a sleepy village. Hence signal  strengths are weak as compared to cities. This is so anywhere in the world. For about 4 weeks the service provider Dialog Axiata ( an international  service provider)has been working on enhancing signal levels with little success. They haven’t given up.

4.	Room  toiletries not 5 star

Bath foam, shower gel, shampoo and body hydrating lotion are famous international brands, are guaranteed safety tested and not poor quality, unsafe products in misleading 5 star  packaging. Soap is a translucent glycerine soap which is soft on the skin, and comes in a 70 gm (usually hotels provide 35 gm) tablet which grips well on your hand.

5.	One staff member cleans the room – takes one hour. Why don’t 2 or 3 work together.

The total floor area of the room is 1261 sq.ft. True it take about one hour to clean. Earlier we used 2 to clean the room in half the time, but  guests complained. They preferred one person cleaning the room whilst they rested in another area of the room. In future we will ask the guests of their preferred method of cleaning. We thank the guest for bringing this to our notice.

6.	Attempted to illegally charge a plus plus method of sales tax, VAT and city tax.

All hotels in Sri Lanka have three components in every hotel invoice. The hotel charge, staff service charge and government taxes. All hotels are required by law to pay tax on the hotel charge + service charge. In fact, not paying the tax is illegal. Hotels have the option of quoting nett rates or + +",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2012-02-24","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","3","Location","4","Cleanliness","4","Service","1","Sleep Quality","2","have waited to write this review until after my wife and I had completed our 19 day honeymoon in Sri Lanka. This mainly because of the disappointing hospitality experience and the extraordinary gap in expectation and service delivery. After spending many many hours researching the most romantic destination in Ceylon, this hotel stood out and so did it's room rate. I will only marry once and so, to surprise my wife I spent $5500 booking their flagship room #5 Saman Villa for 6 nights. It read as a 2 story private enclave with a pool and I will leave it to you to read about the rest of its allure on their crappy site. In the end I could not book through their site and had to phone 4 times to confirm my booking.
To be honest it is a beautiful location with a fantastic layout, and by Sri Lankan standards moderately well maintained, although ticking some of the rating boxes does not constitute a 5 star rating. Your hotel must exceed service expectations and leave no gap between customer perception and delivery of product, especially when paying the exorbitant room rates. In hindsight I really should have booked a hotel in the Maldives for this money and recommend all others considering this hotel to do so or others in the area.

When checking out you'll feel jaded, lied to, deceived and sour that the operators of this venue are ripping you off and as experienced by 2 honeymooners; ripped off with a smile. 
I write this review in the hope that the hotel will lessen the afore mentioned gap in service expectations and delivery. 
A word of advice to management, put some of the money you took from me into staff training, your staff need it desperately, more is not better!
If you cut your staff ratio in half, trained them and intern paid them more money, than perhaps they wouldn't feel the need to shadow the guests constantly fishing for tips and annoying them.
I have put in point form other inadequacies I can remember. Saman Villas ruined our honeymoon and we would like to offer some advice to all contemplating a stay here. 
AVOID STAYING AT SAMAN VILLAS!!
- Wifi Bandwidth poor - continual annoying dropouts and a slow 56kb/per second connection. What should have taken me 10mins a day took over an hour. No 5 star Hotel in the world would even consider an antiquated service like this. But it is a cheap connection and another cost saving - corner cutting measure.
- Waiters reaching over the table to place and remove dinnerware. Servers lurking around/shadowing all the time and annoying you in moments of intimacy. Usually trying to remove plates with food when empty plates clearly visible.
- Servers also then walking past plates/bowls which had been sitting at the side of the table for up to 15 mins. 
- Servers haphazardly clanging plates down on table.
- When calling reception you're lucky to lucky to have them to answer and when you do get through response time can vary on how many times you remember to call them and remind them of your request.
- Room toiletries not 5 star or consistent with rates or a hotel also pushing the spa angle. $100USD for a 50 min massage, and they wonder why no one is using this service ($15 p/h outside the hotel), it's Sri Lanka and your not 5 star.
- Way too many staff in the public area, wandering around aimlessly and trying to have a chat or engage you at any chance to work a tip.
- House phones have a very harsh static noise. (they'll get around to fixing this issue someday)
-Sort of feel hassled each morning to vacate while one staff member cleans the room, only to return after an hour to find him still there. Why don't 2 or 3 work together and get it done in a third of the time. We found our porch used as a base for other cleaners to bring or take things from.	
- Checkout was a nightmare. We were led to believe breakfast was included with the $819USD rate. After 1 and a half hours of squabbling they added another $50 per day for Breakfast and in the midst of all that had attempted to illegally charge a plus plus  plus method to sales tax, VAT and their city tax. This is very illegal and it seems they have been getting away with doing it for years, it made a $70 difference to our bill so multiply that out over a year. The mind boggles at front of houses' ineptness to appease disgruntled guests and their greediness to extract as much cash as possible out of their patrons.
Whats even sadder is they think they have a tight 5 star operation. Perhaps the hotel Management should visit a real 5 star hotel in Europe to wake them from their inept ignorant slumber.
You'll also notice how quickly this negative review disappears down the page from management and the like as they use trip advisor to snare many would be chumps into booking.","Worst hospitality experience we had in Lanka","2012-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r125158726-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",
,"9","123836019",,"en","306376",,"General Manager","124186478","en","2012-02-05","gm1230","We thank the reviewer for praising the location and the massage. Our response to the reviewers adverse comments are given below

1.	Stayed in lower category suite, but had to accept original higher rate.

January and February which correspond  with the European winter are our busiest months. Demand for rooms is very high and on the supply-demand principle our rates are equally high. Almost every hotel in the world has rules/practices governing cancellations and amendments. On arrival reviewer was not happy with the room booked and requested a superior room which we obliged after explaining our rules/practices.

If the reviewer had not booked the suite with a pool we could have sold it to another who requested  the same category of suite. In addition  we released a superior suite to the reviewer by offering a free upgrade to another guest. In the circumstances we could not make any concessions and the reviewer had to honour the original contract with us. The reviewer was adviced accordingly prior to the room change which he accepted.

2.	Soliciting tips

The reviewer has commented on staff and hired entertainers indirectly soliciting tips in 4 paragraphs of his review. The reviewer’s specific comments in this regard are:

(a) “they waited long long time to be honoured for their service”
(b) “we had the feeling that staff were looking for any opportunity to get extra payments and 
                     tips”

(c) “the staff will do your bed or your bathroom five times a day – if they get the opportunity. 
    This could be taken as a sign of explicit service – contrary we had the feeling that staff  where   
    seeking more tips”

(d) “it is expected you honour the dancers with dollars”

Any one reading the reviewers comments will understand that the reviewer is simply expressing his feelings and beliefs and are not based on any facts.

The houseman who carried the bags may have stayed there for a few seconds, but not long long time which the reviewer has interpreted as soliciting tips.

In  (b) and (c)  above  the reviewer expresses his feelings which are not based on any facts. We leave it to those who read this reply to decide whether it is morally correct to make allegations against innocent staff based on feelings.

Dancers who are hired by us for the evening,  perform in a designated  area away from diners and cannot go from table to table. In the circumstances we cannot understand how the reviewer assumed that they “expected dollars”.

Soliciting tips by anyone directly or indirectly is strictly prohibited according to information provided in suites for the benefit of guests.

3.	“We would expect Saman Villas to pay servants enough money so that they don’t have to beg from guests”

	The reviewer has attempted to insult and  demean our staff by calling them servants. No, we don’t have servants. A servant is a person employed in a house on domestic duties. We employ mostly professionals who either have received training out side or trained by us  in-house. Every year during the off-season we train our staff and for this purpose we have a purpose-built tiered lecture hall across the road with audio visual equipment.

	The visitor has attempted to downgrade our staff to beggars. We employ staff according to the best labour standards and human rights, treating them as individuals. Our staff are amongst the highest paid in the industry and they don’t beg from guests.

4.	“We felt that the staff in general are non-professionals hired locally – a nice idea – but if you expect the best a very fatal decision”
	
	The reviewer is correct when he says the staff are hired locally – they are all Sri Lankans and they match up to foreign staff. In fact Sri Lanka provides a large number of staff at all levels to top five star hotels in the Middle East, Maldives and some other countries world wide.

	As already explained our staff are professionals. Reviewer’s comments in this regard are not based on facts, but may be his imagination.

5.	“Staff will do your bed or your bathroom five times a day – if they get the opportunity”

	Yes, if guests request,  for special reasons,  we provide that service and not otherwise.  Staff clean the rooms twice daily in the morning and evening. They do not have time to clean the rooms five times a day specially when the hotel is nearly full,  specially during reviewers stay  when occupancy was 82%. The staff visiting times are recorded and are monitored daily by the Executive Housekeeper and in his absence by the Supervisor.

6.	A Monkey and a Scorpion
	
One thing every visitor agree is that the location is fantastic. Factors contributing  to this are – remoteness of the location, tropical jungle, coconut plantation, rocky promontory and the stunning views. 99.99% of our guests love this place and they are willing to compromise on certain features associated with tropical vegetation such as insects, crawlers, squirrels, monkeys, etc. Remove the vegetation and you will have a bare rock free of animals – no longer a fantastic location. Only those who love living in a concrete jungle will be happy in such a location when on holiday.

Any visitor to Sri Lanka, other than the central parts of the city of Colombo will experience a variety of animals such as insects, crawlers, squirrels, monkeys, lizards, etc. In central Kandy, Sri Lanka’s second largest city monkeys are regular visitors to bedroom balconies/verandahs in some hotels.

At Saman Villas a batch of monkeys is sighted  a few times a year. On this occasion we were aware of their presence and were lighting crackers to frighten them away. They visit open air bathrooms when they are unoccupied and damage the flower vases. Same happened in reviewer’s bathroom , only once.

A tiny scorpion was found on the wall of the reviewer’s bedroom. On  hearing from the reviewer it was promptly removed. The tiny scorpion may have been carried away due to a gust of wind to the balcony or open air bathroom and  may have crawled into the bedroom. There is nothing to get alarmed of. Scorpions don’t attack people.

7.	Food is fair but over charged

Over 95% of our guests consider our food to be good or excellent. Our prices are reasonable when one considers quality and safety we offer. Our kitchen is ISO 22000 certified for food safety, probably the only boutique hotel in Sri Lanka to receive the certification.

8.	Local dance arrangement on Fridays are so loud
	
Yes, it is true because they play Sri Lankan drums. We organize this for the benefit of our guests so that they can experience traditional Kandyan and low country dance forms without having to venture out  incurring additional expenses. No guests have ever complained about any aspect of the performance. However, we have taken the comments seriously and from next week the performance has been advanced to start 30 minutes before dinner. We thank the reviewer for his observation.

9.	Massage is fantastic ! but only until they know you are going home – then they take  out parts of the programme

	Once again we thank the reviewer for praising our therapists for the massage.

	The reviewer and his partner had the following treatments

	(a) Tranquility – 1 hour 25 minutes
	(b) Energizer – 1 hour 10 minutes

	In all treatments there is a certain ritual to be followed at the beginning such as the welcome foot bath which is done before entering the treatment room. Apart from this there is no interruption whatsoever. All treatments are strictly according to pre-designed programmes and the fact that guest is going home is not a reason for changing the treatment. Once again guests are expressing what they felt and thought.

	Generally a therapist does 1 to 3 treatments a day and by no means are they overworked. Once again the reviewer has based his comments on incorrect assumptions.

 10.	Don’t  use Saman Villas own website for booking. You can get more than 30% rebate using others.

	That is simply impossible unless they are offering below cost and at a loss. Tour Operators and Travel Agents are given discounts by us, as otherwise they will not sell the hotel. With that discount they have to cover their selling expenses, overheads and also make a profit. It is true their rates can be lower than ours sometimes, if they keep a lower profit margin. Our rates may appear high, but not if you consider time based discounts and complimentary transfers. We try to keep our rates competitive, not cheaper. We encourage as many travel agents, tour operators and booking engines to sell Saman Villas at competitive rates so that our visitors have a wide choice to select from.

	The hotel offers room only. Breakfast and dinner are offered at concessionary rates.

	We don’t ask  our prospective visitors to book with us. We want them to search the internet and select the cheapest package.

11.	Few  questions regarding the specification to the manager and his reaction was to laugh  us in the face.

	Only question we are aware of is that the guest disputed the charge of 10% service charge. It was explained to him that all hotels charge 10% and that the reservation confirmation sent to him has specified 10% service charge. The reviewer was to check this with the next hotel in his itinerary in Sri Lanka and call us. We did not hear from the reviewer.

	We deny that the Front Office Manager or his assistant laughed him in the face as alleged. When they speak to guests all Front Office staff are required to show a smiling face and that may have been misunderstood by the reviewer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,,"","306376","6.395329","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","80.00548","Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve","1534","4.8","20","8","43","145","1318","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d306376-Reviews-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.jetwinghotels.com/jetwingsamanvillas/","2012-01-30","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","3","Service","1","Sleep Quality","3","We stayed in Saman Villas for for 5 days in January 2012. On our arrival we werrent impressed with the privacy offered in the suite allocated for us. So we accepted an offer for a suite on a lower category ""but"" we had to accept the original ""higher"" rate. Definetely not the way we do our business - but when you where looking for the time of your life you dont want to argue !

Lugage was taken to our room by some quiet friendly personal, who waited a long long time to be honored for their explicit service - carrying two medium sized bags to our downgrated room.

Throughout our stay on Samam Villas we had the feeling that all staff where looking for any opportunity to get extra payments and tips. We understand that the general income on the island is quiet limited - but we would expect a place like Saman Villas to pay servants enough money so that they dont have to beg from the guest on the hotel. Also we felt that the staff in general are non professionals hired locally - a nice idea - but if you expect the best a very fatal desicion.

The staff will do your bed or your bathroom five time a day - if they get the opportunity. This could be taken as a sign of explicit service - contrary we had the feeling that staff where seeking more tips...

We had a monkey in our open air bathroom. This issue was handled quiet professionally from the staff.

We had a scorpion in our bedroom the first night - and asked to talk to the management. However this was not possible - because management had gone to sleep (9 o'clock pm) - which was claimed from the guy who killed the scorpion.

Food is fair but over charged. Pool is nice specially the view. Local dance arrangement on fridays are so loud that you cannot think or talk over your dinner - and also for this, it is expected that you honor the dansers with dollars !

Massage is fantastic ! But only untill they know that you are going home - then they take parts out of the program to allow them some (well deserved) time off...that is what we felt and thought.

Dont use Saman Villas own website for booking. You can get more than 30% rebate using other web booking agents/services - which will then also include breakfast....unfortunately we booked directly. We had a few questions regarding the specification to the manager and his reaction was to laugh us I our face.

Saman Villas was the biggest disappointment that I have had on any hotel.

,"7","121375439",,"en","306376",,"Sales & Marketing Manager","121813280","en","2011-12-16","myfacebook","We refer to the recent stay of two resident expatriates at Saman Villas and wish to explain in detail the issues raised by the reviewers.

1. Complimentary birthday cake:The reviewers stay was for one night from 3rd to 4th December 2011 and the actual birthday of the reviewers’ husband was falling on 5th December 2011. Complimentary birthday cakes are provided only if the particular guest is staying on the day of the birthday.  The reviewer wanted to arrange a special occasion with a special dinner and cake to be presented as a surprise.  We agreed to provide a complimentary cake. When the reservation was confirmed, we sent the prices for the special dinner but the reviewer did not want to book the special dinner. The  reviewer did not discuss or specify the time the cake should be presented after they arrive. The hotel staff had also forgotten to check with the guest about serving the cake, which was a complete oversight on our part. 
 
The reviewer mentioned about the cake not been provided only upon departure; had this been just mentioned to the hotel we would have readily arranged the cake as a surprise. Upon noting our mistake, I immediately called the guest and apologized and requested to meet them in person to explain. Since the guest was not able to provide an appointment, I immediately sent an apology card signed by me and Chairman along with a bottle of Moet & Chandon to the guest residence before the reviewers’ husbands’ birthday.

2. DVD Player was broken: A full check is carried out in all suites before releasing for arrivals. Based on our check list records, the DVD player was functioning before the guest checked-in and therefore we are rather surprised with this complaint. We were informed about a defect only at departure and our Maintenance Department had immediately checked the unit and found it faultless.   

3. Ditch  stinks in the bathroom: All rooms are provided with a water feature – a small pond and a spout with water circulating daily for a  total of six and half-hours. The system  was operating since August 2010 without any problems. During this period the South of Sri Lanka experienced gale force winds and heavy evening rains resulting 19 deaths and 35 fishermen reported missing. The heavy rains continued until 1st December evening. The pond drain-out could not cope with the heavy rains and water was flooding the bathrooms. For the 1st time since August 2010 we had to stop circulation and empty the ponds. The system was restarted with fresh water on 2nd December. Although the ponds were emptied to prevent flooding, some water remained in the pipe lines. Later investigations reveled that micro-organisms had formed in the water remaining in the pipe lines, which had developed unpleasant odors. When the ponds were refilled and the circulation restarted these smells came into the bathroom. Such human errors occur everywhere in the world. According to what we read in the world press not so long ago the nuclear disaster in Japan was one such incident. Since we are aware of the cause of the bad odor, we have taken preventive measures.

Bath, shower and sink water was not affected at all and it was perfectly safe to use the water. There were other guests in the hotel during this time and we have not received such complaints. 

4. Unable to soak due to poor water flow: All suites are provided with an oversize terrazzo bath. The bath spout is a unique design where the water flows from a 6-inch wide, open-top spout. Water flow from a 6-inch wide, open-top spout will look slow as compared to water flowing from a normal half-inch tap. The bath filling time is normal and this is the first ever complaint we have received regarding water flow.

5. Whilst in the private pool a person climbing on to the rock: We were rather surprised of this incident as no one made such a complaint. We would expect our reviewer to immediately raise such an incident, but our reviewer did not do so until they departed from the hotel. Although we have no way of verifying this, we immediately took the matter up with the highest level in the Police. On the instructions of the Southern Province Police Chief, the Officer-in- Charge summoned all the Three-Wheeler drivers to the Police Station and warned them severely. In consultation with the Police, we are taking a course of action to prevent such incidents in the future. 

6. Too much seasoning in the food: We note that the reviewer had consumed a Sri Lankan dish for lunch which was mildly spiced and probably the spices did not agree with them. In the case of dinner the reviewer had chosen the 4 course set dinner which was also consumed by many other guests who had commented very positively. Over 95% of our guests are very happy with our food. This is evident from reviews in websites, blogs and our own guest comment book. 

All issues that have been raised by the reviewer could have been resolved immediately by informing us. The Chairman’s welcome letter provides details of all Departmental Managers, and guests are requested to contact them to raise any issues.  Sadly our reviewers did not raise any of these issues during their stay.

Comment peut-on faire tant d’éloges à un hôtel moyen de gamme aux tarifs d’un 5 étoiles ? Nous nous posons encore la question.

A part la vue depuis le jardin et les fruits du petit-dejeuner, rien ne justifie ce tarif de 268$ la nuit. Accueil classique avec une serviette froide pour se laver les mains et un ramequin de soupe coriandre + gougère dans le jardin, plutôt encourageant. 

Chambre so called supérieure avec vue jardin (voir photo) de tôle ondulée, magnifique et surtout au niveau de la seule route très passante donc bruit permanent. Decoration effectivement sur le thème du train mais avec des meubles noirs abîmés, télé minuscule, literie correcte, placards sans lumière dans le couloir donc on n’y voit rien. Wifi ok et safety box.

Salle de douche avec porte double battant qui claque (pour ne pas nous réveiller mutuellement la nuit nous avons du bloquer un battant avec une chaise) et ne reste pas ouverte, amenities bas de gamme, VMC extrêmement bruyante. Joints moisis…..basique sale. 

Pas de salle de sport mais un cours de yoga à 6h dans le jardin, pas de piscine. Le 1er soir, nous avons subi la flûte de pan du dîner que nous entendions. 

Petit-déjeuner décevant avec peu de choix (pain sous plastique humide, viennoiseries industrielles à l’huile, trois offres chaudes et pas de spécialités sauf un curry de poisson sans riz). Seuls les fruits étaient bons et variés.

Cerise sur le gâteau : lorsque nous avons quitté la chambre la 1ere journée, la réception nous a demandé si le personnel devait faire la chambre pour notre seconde nuit !!!! Nous ne savions pas qu’un hôtel ne faisait pas les chambres….nous voyageons beaucoup et c’est bien la première fois que la question est posée.

Bref, pour ce prix, c’est vraiment de l’arnaque. Nous sommes vraiment déçus.","Pour 268$ la nuit, courage allons voir ailleurs…","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r991890022-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Unfortunately, the experience we had did not meet those expectations.

Firstly, my wife attempted to call the hotel several times before our arrival, but no one answered. This lack of responsiveness gave us a bad first impression and ultimately influenced our decision to leave after just one night. We chose to move to 98 Acres Resort instead, which turned out to be a much better choice with exceptional service.

While EKHO Ella does offer a beautiful view, it simply does not justify the $350 per night price tag. The fresh fruit juices we ordered were watery and tasteless, and the food quality was mediocre at best. To make matters worse, we found cockroaches in our bed, and the bathroom was unhygienic, with a strong odor and visible urine stains. This level of cleanliness is unacceptable for a property in this price range.

Another disappointment was their bar service. Although the property has a bar, they informed us that they do not serve beer. What was most frustrating is that they didn’t offer any alternatives, such as cocktails or wine. This lack of initiative led us to dine at Café UFO in the city center, where we had a much better experience.

In conclusion, apart from the view, EKHO Ella offers very little value for money. We cannot recommend this property, especially when far superior options like 98 Acres Resort are available nearby.","Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Price","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r990009406-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

On arrival I booked a deluxe room with a Mountain View and was given a basement room to a wall and a ladder I had to climb up to view the mountain. 
This cost $280 for a night so I was expecting a great place bearing in mind I could have stayed at the Anassa Wellness spa for the same price down the road. 

We were booked in for the half board package and as soon as they told me it was a bbq buffet I feared the worse.
It was realised as it was awful. 
Crab bisque was like warm and I had half a spoonful.
Curry was cold! 
Potato croquets cold!
Spaghetti cold

We stay 2 mins and declined eating any more and left to a fabulous restaurant called URO in the village. 

The views of the mountain are incredible and the rooms are spacious and clean.

Unfortunately I made the wrong choice for a one night stop. 

Ella is a backpackers stop off and the town is lovely and the best we have seen so far in Sri Lanka .

If I was the manager I would refund the half board option at a minimum but he offered me a bottle of wine! No thanks .","Extremely disappointing in Ella","2024-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r959327934-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

While the view of Ella Gap was indeed stunning, that's where the positives ended, and my disappointment began.

Firstly, the price we paid for a two-night stay, totaling over $600, was incredibly steep for what we received. We expected a level of luxury and comfort befitting the price tag, but unfortunately, our expectations were far from met.

Upon entering our room, we were immediately disheartened by the disrepair and lack of attention to detail. Stains on the bed runner were an unwelcome sight, and the bathroom amenities were a collection of unbranded, generic products haphazardly thrown into a box, not at all what one would expect from a supposedly upscale hotel.

The shower in the bathroom barely worked, and to add insult to injury, it had visible rust stains, which made the overall experience far from pleasant. For the cost we paid, we certainly expected better maintenance and standards.

With our patience waning, we decided to request an early check-out, opting to leave one day before our planned departure. The only saving grace was the man at the front desk, who, upon seeing the pictures we took of our room, displayed kindness and understanding. He offered us a refund for the second night of our stay, acknowledging the disappointing state of the accommodation.

However, even with the partial refund, I must stress that the room we booked was supposedly a ""JUNIOR SUITE,"" and it failed to live up to any sense of luxury or value. The overall experience at the Echo Hotel did not justify its exorbitant price tag.

To make matters worse, we found refuge in the 5-star Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo for a night, paying $100 per night less than what we spent at the Echo Hotel. The stark contrast in quality and value between the two hotels was evident, and it further solidified our belief that Ekho Hotel is grossly overpriced for the experience it offers.

In conclusion, I must caution other travelers against choosing Ekho Hotel in Ella. While the view may impress, the overall state of the rooms and the exorbitant cost make it a highly disappointing choice. I recommend exploring alternative accommodation options that offer more value for money and a higher level of comfort.","The Biggest Disappointment of our Week in Sri Lanka","2023-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r907039855-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

Not much of a view if you have lower room.  I like the room theme of a train journey. The room was very clean, but we had a few issues. The bed was the smallest bed I have ever tried to sleep on, didn't get much sleep the two nights we stayed. For the amount of money spent to stay here there should be a bit bigger beds. Felt like I was going to fall off bed if I rolled over at night. 
Our room phone did not work so we could not contact reception if we needed something.
Every time we went through reception area there was nobody there. When wanted to check out we had to wait for them to call and track down receptionist.
We booked with half board, dinner was horrible no flavor/ seasoning to food, only ate a few bites, was the same at breakfast time. We ended up eating out for dinner the next night and skipped breakfast the following morning of checkout.
There were a few other things but they are minor.
A simple redesign of room to include beds that are a decent size would make this place much better. A good trim of grass / ivy area down below to open up view for those staying in the down area would help also. The seats  view down below you can only see the ivy fence from seat.
And some simple seasoning or something else for the food. Papaya juice and tea was not even good either 
But for now just based on the experience I had in my opinion till these things are addressed only 1-2 stars if you include the view.
I was wanting to go to little adams peak and a few other places after waking up this morning but with the bad sleep the last two nights I was to exhausted to do so.

In any event, there is no way this is the best hotel in Ella. Somehow none of the five star reviews mention that the hotel is located on a bend in the road so you have traffic on three sides of the hotel, with all the honking and rumbling of trucks and buses that entails, all night and all day. 

The entrance to the lower section of the hotel looks like a car park, as do the hallways. The pillows are synthetic and hard, shower weak, furnishings shabby but not chic. The steak we had at the restaurant was inedible, though the fish was fine. Service was friendly, but given the generally exceptional level of service in Sri Lanka, that’s not saying much.

Our apologies to have kept you waiting to check-in on arrival. While inquiring on the matter, I was informed by the head butler that you had arrived an hour earlier that the usual check-in time; which also had been a busy time for the team, serving other guests whilst also attending to the ones getting ready for departure. It was also brought to my attention that the room boy had offered you the comfort of staying in the living room adjacent to the plunge pool in the first floor of your villa, while he was getting the room ready, but you had opted to take a stroll down the pathway in the estate.
 
Our team of culinary experts strive to create a rich dining experiences by producing some of the finest dishes, which have also been highly complimented by many of our guests, but we are sorry to know that none of what we offered had gone well with you.

The villas and the location was nice. The villas were clean and the views were amazing. Couple of staff members including Ajith were inviting and adhering to our needs.

However,  from the time we entered the property, we were kept waiting for one thing or another. Initially we waited at the car park nearly 10 min  till the buggy arrived to pick us up in order to go up to the bungalow. We had lunch and then waited for about 30min( 2-2.30pm) for the room to be ready so we could check in. The following day after breakfast we were again kept waiting from 10.45-11.50 as the room was not cleaned. We walked up and down the property and waited for an hour! Their staff are extremely slow. Was utterly disappointed about this. 

Next and most important issue was the food. It was not up to standard. For the price of 1 night we got very mediocre food which lacked flavour and choice. We received bland food including seafood which was WAY overcooked. Our 2 night stay wasn’t very satisfactory due to the food not being up to par. Would want the chefs Aruna, Upul,  Tharidu and Ranjith to look into this matter and improve for the sake of their future guests.","Long weekend getaway","2023-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r919329646-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review. 

Firstly, please accept our sincere apologies to the delayed response on our part as there were a number of investigations that took place regarding this incident. 

However, as a policy we have taken all measures to inform all our guests during the check in process which includes a room introduction, to place their valuables and belongings in the safety box provided. Provided that the protocols were in place, and a client lost their belongings, we would always give first priority to conduct an inquiry and sort the matter out provided the guest brings the incident to our notice either while they reside at the property or at worst during the day of checkout (even a few hours later is understandable). In this instance we were brought to notice that the belongings were not in place two days after checking out from the hotel, where we are completely unable to take responsibility of the two days a guest spent elsewhere besides the property “Glenross Living”. Given the circumstance, the General Manager nonetheless investigated this incident, however was unable to come up with a conclusion. We hope you understand that we have done our best from our end given the limitations in this scenario. 

Secondly, a turndown service is provided in a hotel as a gesture to create a relaxing post-evening ambiance for a client in order to enjoy a good night’s rest. Gestures such as bringing down the blinders, dimming of lights, refreshing of washrooms, setting up of beds for the night, replacements of used water bottles are some of the services that are provided. The hotel maintains a strict record of the individuals assigned and entering each and every room to maintain order and discipline with the services that we offer. The clients are provided with door tags that gives them an option to express their view on if they do not want the to be disturbed. 

I hope you do understand our situation with this incident.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aluthgama Road, Neboda 00200 Sri Lanka","Neboda","Sri Lanka","00200",,"Aluthgama Road",,"509755","6.594593","Neboda, Western Province","80.09412","Glenross Living Kalutara","284","4.9","3","2","0","15","264","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g27134354-d509755-Reviews-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html","http://www.glenrossliving.com/","2023-07-20","OTHER","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’d booked Glenross to celebrate my birthday and it really was a stunning location. The food was delicious and staff, warm & welcoming. Little did we know, they had other plans for us. 

We checked in around 3 pm and requested for dinner by 7. We’d only used the pool during that time. Yet, we returned back to a cherry-picked clean room. The bed was clean with all the blinds down but the wet towels still in the same place as we’d left it. We thought this was strange and inquired about it. Apparently, it was their turn down service. However, absolutely no mention of this to us. That they will be entering our room at night to steal money and then pretend like it didn’t happen, again cherry-picked. (Will get back to this in a bit) 

We’d been to so many hotels and never had our room cleaned at night, just after we’d checked in. (Unless requested) I’d left some jewelry and my wallet inside my handbag when we went to dinner that night because we weren’t expecting anyone, right. Came back from dinner with a fever and went right to sleep. The next morning, had breakfast and checked out to head home. 

Only once we’d reached home and I had to pay for something, I reached for my wallet. I took some rupees out and noticed that there were lesser notes but didn’t pay too much attention to it until later when I decided to check all the compartments of my wallet. An area that had 3 hundred dollar notes now only had 1 note. Separately, the rupee section was missing a total of 6500 rupees with various denominations. This person had conveniently taken a couple of notes from different compartments so it wouldn’t be noticed. Note that from the time the money went missing to when I found out about it, the bag with my wallet inside was in my sight the whole time. 

This was immediately reported to Glenross’s manager, Mr.Grenville and to the Glenross head office too. Mr.Glenville requested for 2 days to sort this out and get back to me with a solution. The head office was to call me back so I could speak to a supervisor in charge as I was terribly upset. We’d lost close to a 100,000 rupees at a hotel that was supposedly one of the best. Until today, we’ve had no call back from the head office with no reply to my emails. As for Mr.Glenville, he rightfully got back to me within 2 days only to tell us that there was no solution except for us to file a complaint with the police and that they were okay with that. His tone had no sense of remorse. 

This was more than having money stolen from you. I felt violated. Someone had gone through my belongings, disrespected my privacy and Glenross Living did nothing to help.","Unforgettably painful","2023-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r904453229-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

I then made the payment that night (on the 29th around 9.30pm).

I then received confirmation of the booking on the 30th morning, at 10:00am. Around 11:00am, the next day (30th) which was the date on which we were travelling, the Hotel called me as I left the house and informed me that the room was already booked by another party. 
Assuming the other party was also required to make an advance payment, that would entail that the management had already received their advance payment yet was not aware of the same. 

Nevertheless, I was informed by the hotel that my refund would be made immediately (which should be the 30th, i.e., the date of my booking). I provided my bank details on that very day at 1:15pm. 
 
Fast forward to today (5th of January 2023) and I have still not received my refund despite numerous calls and attempts to obtain my refund every day. Constant excuses were provided for the delay. Not only are their staff severely incompetent in handling bookings, they are also very slow in rectifying their blunders. Glenross has by far the worst customer service!

We are concerned that you were not entirely happy with the cuisine and few other aspects and we have addressed the concerns raised with our culinary team and housekeeping. We are sure that the team will learn from this feedback.

Though we opened our property recently in these challenging times, we are determined to get all aspects of product and service similar to our sister properties. 

We thank you for the time taken to explain the concerns and we will spare no efforts to address these concerns so that the excellent ambience complements the cuisine and the service.

The location is just amazing, so is the building and the setting overall! It's just amazing!! The staff was also really friendly & caring. They were also kind enough to prepare a breakfast item that was not originally on the menu for me.

The room did not have facial tissues, so we had to request one. Toilet tissue roll was also half-gone. We had to request the napkins as well for the breakfast although the cuisine needed napkins. There were two 5-course meals (we stayed one night full-board), the vegetables in all dishes were over-boiled and the soup - I literally burnt my tongue. I just kept these to myself instead of complaining, because this is a time everyone in the country is struggling. Tourism is one of the hardest-hit. I just felt happy as I'm in a way contributing to the country by taking this trip, though it is just one drop into a larger ocean... My patience went out of the window when the guy brought a full-size fried rice as the 'main course' for the 5-course lunch. I selected that as it was supposed to be a Thai rice, but there wasn't anything Thai in it - it's pretty much the same fried rice you can purchase from almost anywhere in Colombo for a buck or two.

I don't know whether any of these things are intentional with the half-price package. After all, it is for a different market segment who might actually come looking for fried rice (no disrespect intended to anyone). 

I asked for the menu again - the name is delicately worded where you can legally argue that it's actually fried rice and it's the eggs that came from Thailand :-) 

This looks like a serious business and I don't know why they have to go this cheap. In any case, would like to pay 100% price and come back someday for a proper stay!","Please make 50% offer optional if that helps...!","2022-05","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r838552431-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

Almost everything that could go wrong, did.

The location is poor. It's much more isolated than the website suggests (according to the website, the drive to the airport is two hours, but our driver said it was more like 4.5hrs), and the last 20 minutes is up a single-lane rutted track with no barrier - our driver was really worried about damaging his car, but he just had to keep going as there was no way to turn around. Then when we arrived, the room, while certainly both prettily decorated and huge, had neither air-conditioning nor wifi, even though we booked it through an agent having been told it had both (a dongle was offered, but it didn't work). It was also very poorly cleaned, with a dead cockroach on the floor, hundred of ants, dead and alive, in the bathroom, and a bathroom window that looked like it had never been cleaned. Dinner was awful - inedibly salty soup, overcooked barbequed food with cheap salads, and fruit salad - and priced at a ridiculous 3,000 rupees each (our other guesthouse meals ranged from 1,000 to 1,600 rupees). The breakfast bread was stale and hard as cardboard, and the omelette was raw inside. The door handle fell off, so if when one of us was in the bathroom, the other had to let them out - the staff couldn't fix it. One of the plug points was coming away from the wall and sparked when we tried to plug things into it. We couldn't sleep because of the heat.
 
I would say, though, that the staff were all very kind and did everything they could to help, but it was obvious that there was no professional hotel manager on site. 

We had booked for two nights before flying home, expecting a relaxed getaway, but left after one night, hot, stressed and upset. We had been offered a change of room to one of the two rooms with a/c, but we'd just had enough by that point. I've delayed writing this review until our agent had a response from Glenross - the result was a complete refund for both nights, which I think was only fair.","An awful experience","2012-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134354-d509755-r131735886-Glenross_Living_Kalutara-Neboda_Western_Province.html",

You had a disappointing experience at the hotel. While the friendly staff and restaurant manager are positives, the issues you faced, such as outdated accommodations, plumbing problems, and the unexpected guest in your room, certainly overshadowed your stay. Renovations could make a significant difference in enhancing guest comfort and satisfaction. Feedback like yours is crucial for hotels to understand where they need to improve. Hopefully, your next stay elsewhere will meet your expectations!

it's a typical Sri Lankan style, that's is why our country is suffering like this, foreigners will never comment like this,
it's a shame to Sri Lanka tourism, this particular person does not know about my experience, may be he is new to the

We called the reception who called the hotel manager to review the security camera footage. They came to my room with the culprit and claimed it was a bellboy with a room service delivery who came to the wrong room. I had no way to validate this as the footage was not offered.

My wife is now completely freaked out thinking someone is going to rob or kill us in our sleep and this whole situation could have been resolved by 1) not giving waitstaff master access to all rooms 2) training staff accordingly to identify the correct room for orders 3) directing staff to call when the door is not answered for a food delivery.

Very hotel had its flaw- when i checked in here I thought wow. First impression great, located next to the beach with a beautiful sea view. The next day is where it all started! A miscommunication regarding about payment, I was not surprised they would take the full payment as soon as I checked in. It’s a first for me, this usually happens at check out at every hotel I stayed at. The reception staff did not make this clear- I even asked, ‘anything to pay?’ Upon my arrival. He stated “no”. He should have said, “no as the balance has been taken already.” As he wasn’t clear, this caused inconvenience for me as I changed all my money to rupees so I can pay for the hotel, so I can avoid using my card as direct debits are due out. After speaking to the manager about this, he hasn’t done anything. Still reeling about this, I have breakfast the next day. Just to find an uncooked chicken sausage! It’s raw as anything and pink in the middle. (See the photo). My 4 year old son was about to eat that. After complaining about that, the manager brushed it under the carpet and walked away. No apology from anyone- manager or chef no one! They advertise a man cave with pool table facilities in the lift, booking.com and on he leaflets. Nothing! Wifi is poor and also had a fiasco regarding room service. THe menu clearly states when you order a curry, you receive a rice dish and 3 vegetables dishes. That’s not the case, you have to pay extra for the 3 vegetable curries and rice. Not clear at all and again no apology. This hotel has taken the gloss off my holiday and I will not be returning to this hotel ever. Anyone reading this please take this advice into consideration! There are many other hotels in Colombo that you can book and get value for money. Read my review on GOH hotel in Colombo- that place has been there since the British ruled the country and its a better hotel than this!

During our first stay my son and myself stayed in room no 510 and before going to sleep he enjoyed the music and slid his headphones under the pillow as per his habit, which he forgot to pick up while checking out. After apporx. 1 hr on the road to Habarana, he realized his mistake and we immediately got in touch over phone with the reception. And here our ordeal began, and after several calls we were very casually told by the lady that they couldn't locate it. During our second stay, I requested a meeting with the manager. A gentleman met us on 29 May and his business card read as ""Ronald Perera, CEO"".  Though I didn't want to create a fuss over it, but at the same time I wanted to make a strong point that he must seriously look into the issue and try to identify the culprit and punish. Today it was JUST a headphone costing USD 100, but the same person could put them in serious trouble sometime in future. The gentleman listened to me patiently and very casually thanked me to bringing it to his notice. He didn't even feel the need to apologize for the inconvenience caused. Surprisingly he seemed to be a qualified hospitality professional because his card mentioned his qualification as "" FCHSGA (SL), M.I.H(U.K)"".

After returning home, I wrote an email to him after a few days to check whether something was done in this regard. Again, I didn't receive any communication whatsoever from him. At this point I decided to put a feedback on TripAdvisor as a cautionary warning to the people who chose this hotel for their stay.

Rooms were nice, offering beautiful views of the sea shore. Across the road and on the seashore is a railway line-local trains run through it from early morning till late evening. Whenever a train passes by, you will hear some noise even on 7th floor, but I didn't find it that disturbing.

 even she hadn't tray balance !

afterward she left I asked from receptionist,   who is she??

Greetings from Thaala Bentota !

I would like to sincerely apologize for the challenges you experienced during your holiday with us. As you mentioned, we encountered unforeseen issues with the air conditioning in the hotel due to the extreme weather conditions at the time. Please be assured that this was an unexpected situation, and as a result, we were unable to operate our full room inventory during that period.

In an effort to make up for the inconvenience, our team graciously upgraded your room to a five-star category at the EDEN hotel, including an upgrade to both your room and meals. I’m glad to see that you accepted this gesture, and I hope it provided a more comfortable experience.

If you take a moment to read through the guest comments shared both above and below yours, you’ll see the level of service we strive to provide. One of the most commonly praised aspects is the friendly and accommodating attitude of our staff.

I hope you will understand the real situation and also, we are waiting to welcome you to Thaala anytime you convenient

While the setting initially seemed promising, the overall experience was highly disappointing.

We ordered a cheesy burger, a couple of beers, and a fruit salad. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was far below expectations. The fruit salad was nothing more than small dices of watermelon, papaya, and pineapple – no garnish, lime, or effort to enhance its appeal. The cheesy burger was equally disappointing. Despite its name, it featured only a basic slice of cheese on a chicken patty, lacking flavor and any creativity in preparation.

Although the server was humble and polite, he did not address our feedback about the burger. When we mentioned that it was not up to standard, he simply smiled and said ""okay"" before retreating to a corner to use his phone, showing little regard for our concerns.

A manager in full black attire briefly visited the area but left without interacting with guests or supervising the service. Furthermore, the washroom facilities were unclean and in dire need of housekeeping attention.","Unhappy","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r989367534-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Da wir über 5 Nächte hier sind, war eine kostenlose Massage inklusive. Als wir bei Spa danach fragten, erfuhren wir, dass diese nur 15 Minuten dauert, nur für eine Person ist (obwohl wir beide ja einen pro Person Preis bei DERTOUR bezahlt hatten). Eine Frechheit.

Positives - lovely people, waiters, pool guys and ground staff. Reception not so good. The room, when we eventually got what we wanted, was really good and well looked after. The Hotel grounds and the beach were beautiful and very clean.
Room - Deluxe Room. First floor have a very cramped balcony with a poor view. Ground floor Deluxe same dimensions but a huge terrace.
Food offering is very poor. The buffet is awful and repetitive using very cheap produce. The a la carte option is served in Chatters which is really a pool bar with the food cooked in a kitchen some 60' from the table and has to be carried across having been left on the counter, hence it was never really hot. One saving grace was that were able to order fresh fish on three nights but at an extra cost of around £80.  
The Frangipani Restaurant that was supposed to be the main a la carte restaurant was closed as it was deemed unsafe! 
All inclusive wine was white or red served from a 3 litre box. No alternatives and no Rose. All soft drinks in the room fridge were charged as extra!
The hotel offers no information on tours or the local area but Shiran Tours on the beach is reliable, good value and honest.
No umbrellas in the room which can be needed with the current weather.
Not enough sun beds with umbrellas and those that were available on the garden and around the pool were quickly reserved with the usual towels/book on the bed at around 7.00am.
The large majority of guests were Russian or Latvian some of whom thought that is was acceptable to go to dinner in a vest/singlet, despite a notice at the entrance asking gusts not to.
This is a second visit to Sri Lanka where, on our first time, we toured so have experience of other hotels

After reading the reviews about Thaala previously known as Avani Bentota, my sister and I were so excited to be staying at this resort. However, I am sad to say I will not be returning or recommending it after our experience. 

ROOM
After a 22hour journey from the UK, arriving at 22:25, we found that even after 5 emails requesting a twin room sent in advance to bentota@avanihotels.com, the email advertised on their website, that we were still booked into a standard room with one bed. We expressed this to the Thaala/Avani Bentota reception staff and manager Hiren at check in, only to be told they cannot do anything about it now, they will change our room in the morning when other guests have checked out. Not what you want to hear on your first night when feeling exhausted. 
The next day, we were told the same thing and were not moved into a new room. It was not until day 3 of our trip, once again 21:53 at night, after a day's excursion were we moved into the superior twin room we had booked and paid for. 

CLEANLINESS/ HYGIENE 
When finally moved to our new room, housekeeping had to be called 5 times as the sheets put on the beds were filthy and soiled! Not what you would expect at a 5-star resort. Each sheet that was laid on the bed had red, green or black blotch stains on them. If not stains, then they were torn or holey. I could not understand this. I would be standing next to the Thaala/ Avani Bentota staff member, seeing stains the size of my palm or worse, yet he continued to lay the bed unless I said, ""sorry this one is also stained"". I was perplexed as to why the hotel even retained these sheets, let alone thought them acceptable for guests to sleep in or on.
As a result, we then had to return to our first room for the night because it got so late, and we just needed to sleep. For the rest of the trip, every day, the bedsheets had to be checked and usually changed, as it was clear any old sheets were used to dress the beds. Whether clean or dirty. The next morning, we did not hear a word from the manager Hiren about an alternate room change, or for the rest of our stay. I spoke to Hiren and said to him this is not what I expect. It feels like this is being done on purpose because the sheets are indisputably dirty. It was only after speaking with another guest, who informed us that they were given new sheets that, again I ask for another set of sheets and was provided brand new bedsheets. This was on day 7 of our trip! 
This kind of treatment from Thaala/ Avani Bentota staff, makes you feel like you are being a difficult or fussy guest, when quite clearly brand new, unused sheets were available in the hotel and could have saved a whole week of unnecessary discomfort. No one pays to stay in any resort to feel this way, let alone a 5-star hotel.","Sorely disappointing","2023-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r921116285-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

1: some of the staff who hang around reception are quite rude and militant, they dont know what customer service is

2. Right outside the hotel a taxi mafia operates, they come onto Avani property and the hotel is obviously complicit in their scams.  The mafia will physically attack and abuse your driver unless its booked through them, but their prices are extortionate.  Do not use these taxis and tuk tuk standing outside

We arrived to what looks like an amazing posh hotel to be shown to a superior room  , but five minutes later we had a courtesy call from reception and I said the room 224 has a smell of damp and the shower also had damp stains . We were shown another room which also had damp and finally another room with the least smell 116 ,but they had sprayed with air freshener which soon disappeared. I suspect air conditioning issues so we used the fan for our whole stay to minimise the smell
After 30 minutes our suitcases weren’t delivered so we collected them ourselves.
There is also a loud train with horns blaring  that passes and sounds like it’s next door from 5am till late. After my evening meal , which was of poor standard and service except waiter Buddika and Maneesha. You clearly get some service depending on the colour of your skin .Reception asked about my issues and I was honest with him , the managers from housekeeping and catering arrived and I could tell they just were not interested or wanting to admit there were any issue and when asked surely others have reported this issue the manager was in denial offering yet another room.
Our room was near reception so was could hear noise most of the evening and morning from reception and cleaners  . Even the cheapest hostel is better than this awful hotel and I have stayed in 6 other hotels in Sri Lanka on this trip and this is the most expensive and worst
No approach from the manager to even address the problems , shocking maintenance of hotel facilities  .The only reason I didn’t leave on arrival is that I had been travelling for 12 hours . The pictures say it all and this was a superior room

Hope your well.

As requested with regards to our stay at your hotel...we regrettably would like to further inform you of our unfortunate experiences:

Where do we start...?

1ST INCIDENT 
ROBERT - GENERAL MANAGER 
We arrived at approximately 2030 / 28th August 2023 and was met by Robert - General Manager.  We mentioned the Roads leading up to the Hotel was very bumpy dark and not sufficient Signage towards Hotel...Despite this...my Husband and I found the Ride leading up to Hotel quite adventurous...although, upon mentioning these  facts to Mr Robert (thinking of other guests)...and also mentioning that we had tried to contact Hotel several times with different numbers to inform our estimated time of arrival without much success...all this was shrugged off and Mr Robert simply said...""oh well...your here now"" with a hand gesture !

Due to bad feeling from beginning...all throughout our stay bad experiences just spiralled...day after day...

2ND INCIDENT 
Large Cockroach discovered soon after our arrival in our accommodation under fridge !
Due to our utter shock and disgust...not to mention this was now quite late in the evening on first night after arrival...we were very very tired after our long journey to Karparha Sands Hotel 8 - 10 Hours on the Road) - we had contacted Mr Robert who had mentioned he was sleeping when we called...this was the first time he had heard of Cockroaches in accommodation and not sure what he can do for us !  Unfortunately Mr Robert's flippant attitude did not help this matter and made us feel that we were not being truthful with what we saw...please see attachment !
We were eventually moved that same evening and to our shock and dismay he mentioned that we may need to move back to same Accommodation !  Which we instantly refused and mentioned we did not at all feel comfortable with this...

3RD INCIDENT 
The second Accommodation was equally worse than the first Accommodation due to its dirty appearance and other aspects as attachments...to name but a few:

- The large Tear on roof of tent which was stitched back together...

-  Very dirty stained floor mat...
- Dirty Floor with unsightly Mark's...also along edges of Tent...

-  Inadequate Shower Facilities with only Half a Turn Handle which were very stiff and required extra pressure to turn water on and off and would hurt our hands in the process...

-  Much Algae from where the water flow began and much green Algae on the wall of stone work...very unsightly for guests...

-  Toilet becoming blocked several times...

-  Large Mirror was near to the actual Toilet...and felt this should be situated near to Towel Rack on the other side...

- Insufficient Towels displayed and not always complete with correct Towels...

-  A large bunch of House Keys were left by the House Keepers in one of our Accommodation...

- Much dried and dead flowers and foliage in outside shower areas...

- Unable to visualise how shower water was being drained...didn't appear to have much of Drainage System...other than going into the Plant areas !

- Some times noticed sewage odours coming from under the Decking  !

-  No privacy from outside shower facility due gaps and Guests and Staff passing by are able to quite easily peer into Shower area !

-  There were significant gaps inbetween the Decking which lead into the accommodation which may result in certain creatures entering the room  !  We already had problems with many Flies within accommodation...

-  Mosquito / Netting missing from around bed frame / Posts...

- Outside / Infront of Accommodation - the Seating area Canopy also has Rips/Tears...

-  Water with Flowers just outside accommodation to wash away sand on feet prior to entering room...were not always available...

4TH INCIDENT 
We were moved yet again to a 3rd Accommodation where much of above situations were quite apparent and common in each Tent Accommodation...

All of the above Incidents & Experiences actually comprises and amounts to many many unfortunate experiences....

We should also mention that efforts were made upon speaking and expressing our concerns since beginning of our arrival at Karparha Sands Hotel with Avanti - Resident Customer Relations Manager...who actually also confirmed that sightings of Cockroaches have been mentioned previously despite Mr Robert's previous comments...Although by this time- we expressed that we didn't want to stay at your Hotel...as we were extremely disappointed...

Although we appreciate and can understand to certain extent situations are are not ideal after Pandemic etc...as Guests & Customers - what we have experienced is by no means a 5 Star Accommodation as described our experiences above !  This was quite apparent during the rest of our stay in Sri Lanka when we went onto visiting and staying at other 5 Star Hotels which despite the country's economic situation were very much the standards they should be with the level of Service expected from 5 Star Hotels...

Please also be advised that we had specially selected your Hotel for our Double occasion...our 10 Year Anniversary and my Birthday out of all nearby Hotels to celebrate our Special Occasions...thinking we would treat ourselves to what we thought was a 5 Star rated Hotel...especially also returning to Sri Lanka after 5 Long Years...to be sadly confronted with all of the above incidences  !   
We had booked for 4 Nights of which the first 2 Nights Days were spent moving from one accommodation to another...a total of 3 x Accommodation Moves...
Unfortunately this is certainly not a 5 Star Hotel and would honestly rate this Hotel as a 3 Star which Guests should be aware of prior to making Booking !

Dear Avanti as mentioned and requested I have now spent time and effort composing this emai and would greatly appreciate if this correspondence can be definitely forwarded to the Founders for them to acknowledge our unfortunate circumstances and to please copy me in when you forward this to them.

Thanking you for your assistance and response.

Regards 
Shantha & Ronny

The resort was the only one that did not meet our expectations. When approaching the resort fromt he main road through gravel road, it was already dark. As the road was so extremely bumpy and not illuminated at all our experienced Sri Lanka driver had serious doubts if this track would lead to a 5 star resort. But as Google Maps doesn't lie we have stayed on the track and finally reached the resort......

Quickly our driver has been provided access to a drivers' room and we have been guided to our room. After being ready to go to bed we have seen that the bed linen was dirty and we have wondered how this could happen in a resort on this level. So instead of sleeping we have asked the staff to replace the bed linen. Also in the outside area of the accomodation we have seen in the morning that the place had not been furbished up for new guests. The cushion of the daybeds outside had not been cleaned from sun lotion and sand of the previous guests and looked like you see on the picture below. Cigarette butts beside the daybeds didn't make you want to be there...... also a cleaning of the table outside from sand etc. had to be requested on the next morning...... unfortunately we cannot say that housekeeping performed a good job.

The accomodation itself is designed nicely but you see that this is not achieved with high quality materials in most cases. So having a closer look does not make you feel to be in a luxurious environment. As a result of this you already distinktly see signs of abrasion on several things - though the resort is quite new! I worry how it will look in 2-3 years from now. Absolutely no comparison to high class resorts like Wild Coast Tented Lodge or Uga Ulagalla that we had been able to experience as well during our trip. At least the space was spacious in our accomodation.

After the first disappointments with the above mentioned we have seen the surroundings on the next morning. The beach is really stunning! The ocean was very well accessable for swimming during our stay - even for little children. The water temperature was very comfortable. We just didn't understand why daybeds had so rarely been provided around the beach area..... if your accomodation is not at the beachfront, you need to be quick in the morning to secure your daybed.

Also very nice is the design of the hotel pool. It's nicely constructed with nice looking tiles which don't appear cheap. 

The food in the restaurant was quite average and - compared to the other five star accomodations during our trip - the worst. It was ""just ok"". 

What we have felt during our stay was that several staff members did not seem to be happy with their jobs / the guests. We have rarely seen smiling faces from the staff. We can even state that our feeling was that there is a very strange atmosphere in the resort regarding the staff. We have never felt comfortable with this - different to any other hotel that we have stayed in during the trip.

Our driver for two weeks was always happy and very modest. But regarding the drivers' accomodation he said, that it was unacceptable - especially the sanitary environment was abominable.

Finally our experience leads into the conclusion that we cannot recommend the resort. The hardware and the location with it's surroundings is Ok with some curtailments - but the software needs to be improved urgently and severely!","nice location but the resort needs to be improved noticeably!","2023-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r905584097-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

However, I should say that I was against coming here in the first place as the room was essentially a glorified tent on the beach.
As it transpires, I was correct. As soon as we arrived , a snake dropped out of a palm tree and landed on the sand. Later, a similar (or perhaps the same one) jumped onto our veranda and grabbed a crab in its mouth. My wife saw a larger snake slither over a sun lounger. The tent is divided into two sections, which enables the guest to sit on the toilet and converse face to face with the other guests, in the style of the ancient Romans.
The roar of the sea is incessant throughout the night.
The driveway access to the hotel is really very poor. Also, my brother’s tent experienced several power cuts during our stay.
On the plus side, the food was very good, and I would like to thank k. Vithurshan the waiter and R. Thus he than the bartender. In fact, all the staff were friendly and helpful.

1. Beautiful beach
2. Good entry into the ocean
3. The staff is polite and tries very hard to help, I would like to mention Kirupa and Akthar separately

Negative:
1. The hotel is located very far from the airport, the transfer takes 6-7 hours one way.
2. The room is a tent standing on the ground. The room stinks of dampness and mold. The floor in the tent is worn out, covered in many years of plaque, no one washes it, but only sweeps it. The hotel does not sanitize rooms from parasites. Huge cockroaches, 5 cm long, small frogs are constantly crawling around the room. Small insects constantly fall on the bed, which is absolutely not hygienic! At night, you can hear squirrels running on the fabric roof of the tent.
3. The toilet is leaking, which is why the room constantly stinks of sewerage.
4. Bedding with holes. In general, the room is quite dirty, constantly haunted by a feeling of unsanitary conditions.
5. The shower is presented only on the street, after you have a swim you have to walk on the stones, your feet are dirty again. A small snake was once seen between the stones.
6. There is no TV in the room.
7. On the beach, you can say on the territory of the hotel, fishermen live. Not far from the pool they have two huts in which they sleep. There is a well nearby. Fishermen drive tractors all day on the beach, it stinks of diesel. You lie on the beach sunbathing, the fishermen walk past the sun loungers and look at you, at your wife. There is no sense of security and you absolutely do not rest because of these views. On the beach technical garbage, blades are lying around. Fishermen spend the whole day on the beach, going back and forth, driving a tractor. They throw a net, and a rope goes far into the sea, and when they drive along the beach on a tractor and pull this cable, you have to get out of the sea so that they don’t cut off your head with this cable. So-so vacation… 
8. No one cuts coconuts on palm trees, and they periodically fall on the sand, which is very dangerous for tourists who simply lie under palm trees and do not assume that a coconut can fall on their heads.
9. There are no sun loungers on the beach. That is, they are only for guests of the rooms of the ""Palam"" category. For rooms of category ""Koyala"" sun loungers near the room in the garden and by the pool. That is, if you want to lie on the beach, there is no such possibility. You can lie on the sand or on creepy-looking pillows, which are also only 2 or 3 pieces.
10. Pillows on sunbeds and towels in a disgusting state.
11. They sell warm coconut in the bar. It's not my first time in a tropical country, but I'm drinking warm coconut for the first time.
12. Breakfast menu. There is no buffet. Every day they are the same. The menu says that you can order mango juice, however it is not available. The waiters explained this by the fact that now is not the mango season, while it is sold in stores. 3 sausages are served for two people, and those are soy. No ham, no cheese.
13. The restaurant has very slow service, the dish is carried from 40 to 60 minutes. Anytime, for lunch or dinner.
14. Waiters constantly mess up, forget your order, bring not what you ordered, you have to wait until your dish is cooked.
15. The food is incredibly spicy. You constantly say “not spicy”, they still bring spicy food.
16. Chipped dishes are used.
17. The restaurant is incredibly dirty. Pigeons and crows are constantly flying. Pigeons generally made a nest under the roof of the restaurant from the inside. Because of this, chairs, pillows, even appliances in bird droppings, nothing is removed, everything is dirty, no one cares. Cats sleep on pillows. The pillows are dirty and smell like cat urine.
18. The clothes of the waiters are dirty, it seems that they have not been washed for weeks.
19. General manager Robert does nothing. Doesn't go outside the restaurant. For 10 days, I have never seen him on a tour of the territory, or that he looked at least one room. He only goes to dinner and says: “Good evening. Have a good day?
20. We ordered tea, they brought us tea in bags. In a country where leaf tea is grown, they brought tea in bags!
21. On the territory, in the restaurant, in the pool there are burnt out light bulbs, no one changes them, no one cares.
22. The toilets are very dirty, there are almost never towels, there is nothing to wipe your hands with. Soap is also not always available. The toilets on the ground floor never have lights on in the evening.
23. Pigeons and crows bathe in the pool. Terrible filth and unsanitary conditions.
24. After 7 days of staying at the hotel, prices for the menu increased sharply, and not by 10%, but by 40%, for example, the old price for Seafood BBQ was 6900 LKR, the new price is 10000 LKR, an increase of 44%.
25. On the 8th day of my stay at the hotel, my body could no longer cope with the dirt in the hotel, and I caught rotavirus, spent the whole day lying in the room. Luckily I had medication with me. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, and if you catch something, you are unlikely to be helped. First aid kit in the hotel is very poor with expired medicines.
26. Upon arrival, I wanted to pay for the transfer, the price was supposed to be 44,000 LKR in both directions, they told me that I had already paid for it and they would check it. No one has returned to me with feedback. However, when leaving, the transfer price turned into 50000LKR. I consider it an unprofessional attitude towards customers to overestimate the price at which there was an agreement earlier.
27. The transfer to the airport was in the evening, no one even offered a late check-out. Taking into account the fact that out of 17 rooms, 12 were occupied. That is, 5 rooms were free, but we were forced to vacate the room at 11:00 am.
28. Every day, especially in the evening, the lights are turned off several times. You are sitting at dinner and suddenly it is completely dark, after 1-2 minutes the generator starts.
29. There are no cameras on the territory, the security is rather weak.","Very durty","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r832391491-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

By law, Sri Lanka does not have private beaches - this means that the natural beauty and splendor of the island’s beaches belongs to everyone. Fishing is a valuable industry in the country, and the fishermen from the local village have been co-existing with us in harmony for years. There is absolutely no threat to be feared from them; they go about their daily lives to provide for their families, with no disturbance to our guests or to the hotel.

As for the hotel related comments raised by this guest:

Almost 5km of untouched beach stretch. We were so excited to go here. Unfortunately beyond this everything was downhill. With the resort at full capacity, one would have expected a full staff! There were literally two service staff for more than 25 ppl, the staff were not trained well at all with one waiter being extremely rude. 

The food was below average with half the things on the menus being “unavailable “. There was no manager on duty to even inquire about anything. The worst was when we wanted to order a Beach BBQ for dinner and asked them a day in advance ( as stipulated in the menus) and the response was “ some other guest have also ordered and there are only three ppl, so they can’t do it for us”. The waiter was so rude and didn’t even bother to explain to us in detail. 

We left there after one night. Such a shame that a place like Karpaha Sands is marketed in one way and what you get in terms of food and service is worse that a 3 star hotel. 
Given the location, view and beach I would def return, once the chef and service staff are trained properly. Where there should be atleast 3-4 staff per room there was 1 per 5 rooms!! 

* there was no COVID protocols- staff had no masks or gloves on. Every other resort we have been to post COVID have admirably followed safety precautions)
* there was no turndown service 
* we had to take our own bags to the rooms 
* there was no service on the beach

Greetings from Araliya Green City - Nuwara Eliya!
We regret to hear that your check-in experience did not meet your expectations. Our team at Araliya Green City is dedicated to providing professional and respectful service to every guest, and we are truly sorry if you felt otherwise.
Upon your arrival without a prior reservation, our reception team worked swiftly with housekeeping to arrange two rooms for you, despite the hotel being near full occupancy at the time.
With regard to your request to exchange damaged USD notes, we kindly explained that, in accordance with hotel policy and local banking regulations, we are unable to accept or exchange torn or defaced currency. In addition, your request for a 30% discount was respectfully declined, as our rates are fixed during peak occupancy and offered consistently to all guests to maintain fairness.
We understand that these limitations may have caused disappointment, but we assure you that our team, including Mr. Gavindu, did their best to assist you within the hotel’s guidelines. 
However, once your concerns were raised, I personally got involved in the check-in process to ensure your comfort and satisfaction. I am happy to note that by the end of the process, you expressed that you were satisfied with the service received.
We truly value your feedback and appreciate the opportunity to resolve the situation. Should you choose to visit us again, we look forward to welcoming you with the warm hospitality that we are known for.

We appreciate your feedback. It’s important to clarify that the establishment you mentioned operates as a regular food court business rather than a five-star restaurant.

That said, your comments about cleanliness, service delays, and staff engagement are valuable. These aspects are critical in any hospitality setting, and we will share your feedback with the relevant team to ensure improvements are made.

The shower was fine when we left it and, anyway, I would not expect a 5 stars property to advance requests for the repayment of (eventual) non intentional small damages. The restaurant includes a disco that prevents guest from holding conversations at dinner time. Moreover, the main dining room lacks of windows and sources of natural light. My nephew went to the indoor pool and described it as in poor conditions. The staff at the reception, despite being kind, is not able to handle very simple requests. Not worth it.

Take you own coffee and water!","Rooms","3","Location","4","Service","1",,,,,,,"After reading the glowing reviews about the hotel and the room views we booked in for 2 nights but wished we had left after day one.
On check in reception told  us that they weren't busy so we asked for an upgrade. 
We found we had a view....of the petrol station......we should have complained straight away but were so tired we thought we could put up with it but surely there could have been a better room??   
We went out to eat and asked reception for some fresh milk to have with our coffee in the morning ( no coffee machine in the room) and some more water ( there were just two small bottles in the room which is barely enough to make tea or, god forbid coffee!!) On our return nothing had arrived so we thought we would just call down in the morning, its a 5 star after all.  And then the debacle began....After numerous phone calls  in the morning someone eventually arrived with a handful of various sachets of tea, powdered coffee and creamers but no fresh milk.  These were kind of useful as we then found that the container in the room that said 'coffee' only held even more creamer.....so we persevered to eventually be sent a teapot half full of lukewarm powdered coffee and loads of warm milk.  This took an hour and we couldn't drink it as it was vile.
We appreciate this is a tea region and I drink gallons of it but surely there are other people who prefer coffee in the morning??  There is a tea room in reception that has a huge coffee machine but it seems it was only used for hot water or nobody knows how to use it.
Day 2 and we tried again.....to be told twice  the coffee is on its way to then be told they only have Sri Lankan coffee. Erm....
We gave up after an hour as we were checking out then when we were in reception it started again as different staff kept asking us if we had a problem with our coffee.  We had forgotten about it by then but they were all terribly apologetic and offered to provide us with some while we waited for our taxi.    Still nothing appeared and after explaining to around 3 people I was losing the will to live.  Eventually 2 lovely coffees appeared from the food hall next door.  Hurrah. 
But this had taken 2 hours from out first call that morning.
I tried to explain that when one issue becomes such a debacle it makes any other little niggles that one would normally overlook  become a problem too.  
The windows in our room wouldn't close properly so each morning the traffic on the roundabout next to the petrol station woke us up,  these windows and frames were dirty,  the magnifying mirror light didn't work, the tap in the sink in the bathroom needed descaling,  the pot for the used teabags was really grubby.
I assume the hotel has a 5 star rating as they have a swimming pool which looked quite depressing in a small covered area but  its certainly not the service.  The staff were all really lovely and smiley but there was obviously no communication between them. Or maybe just say if a service is not possible so customers can just get on with their day rather than wait around to be misled.  We stayed in numerous hotels of various levels that we stayed at in Sri Lanka and this was the only one that we had a problem with.
We were reassured numerous times that the taxi ordered through the hotel  to take us to our next stop knew where he was going.   Guess what......
Simply bad management.","Disappointing","2023-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d12864938-r881467919-Araliya_Green_City-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We finally got only 9 items for the price of 3000 per head. And also it was only one piece of each item per person. It was a buffet in name only.  No refill. Also the bread items presented were stale. It was a bad experience for me and all of us were disappointed. We did not even get a portion that's given by high tea platters usually...We did not expect this from a highly rated 5 star hotel. After complaining to the reception they reduced the payment of 5 kids only. 

As a side note we would like to mention we went for a dinner buffet 2 months before and it was perfect and really worth it, and so we recommended it to many. This was the reason why we went there again.

At the outset we wish to thank you for having stayed at the Araliya Green City Hotel, Nuwara Eliya.

Our forte has invariably been unobtrusive service and unfailing attention to all discerning Guests. We take great pride in serving all our guests.

I am sincerely sorry and please accept my apologies because were unable to reached your expected standards.

Your feedback on the faulty lighting did not go unheeded, however, the Front Desk staff member gave a room change on the same night with minimum delay. Besides, the Management was also pleased to offer you complimentary breakfasts to your family the following morning and a late checkout according to your convenience.

The issue although very inconsequential it was solved immediately and the Management has been benevolent in offering value additions as a good gesture. We hope that you will appreciate the fact the Management has exerted themselves to the best in dealing with this matter.

Therefore, in fairness we regret very much to inform you that the Hotel has not failed in the services offered to you.

We wish you and the family great health, happiness and peace.

Firstly, please accept my sincere apologies for the apparent discomfort caused to your sleep in the night.
Nuwara Eliya is generally a very quiet town in the night as almost everyone goes to sleep by 10 pm but since the holidays are around the corner their might have been more traffic than usual contributing to noise pollution! 
Your constructive feedback on wine service has led us to immediately implement a refresher course on wine service to all my waiter staff and thank you. 

Rest assured changes necessary to minimize sound pollution has been implemented immediately with the corporation of the city traffic police and trust you would consider staying with us again as and when your travels bring you back to our great city.

Hope to welcome you back in the very near future.

If we can't sleep, it really doesnt matter how friendly the staff is or how tasty the food is.

When the streets finally became quiet enough, suddenly the call to prayer is blasting. Even if the noise was controlled, the curtains are sheer and the room is lit up with the sunrise. Lastly, the bathroom walls allow you to hear the conversations of your neighbors. 

Overall, service was good but our dinner waiter hovered to an awkward degree yet struggled to complete simple tasks like bringing water to the table in a timely manner. The wine I requested was only available by the bottle, fine, I'll take the bottle...he brought out three glasses, one for me and one for both my young daughters.

Greetings from Araliya Green City !

Whilst extending our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused and we thank you for your feedback which we greatly value in our continuous efforts to serve you better. As you have stated that the hallways are dark is because we are moving our standards into be the one of the most Eco-friendliest hotel in the country, despite of the water is not heated up to standard is doubtful as we have not received any complain with regards to the temperature of the water as it’s been a centralized system, but we will definitely look into it and take it as a constructive feedback. As a practice we always double check prior releasing the rooms for the guest but it is such an unfortunate situation to know that the kettle was not working, but indeed we will look into it as well. Furthermore we should state that the chef we have is a master chef and the most of the guest do love the buffet and its spread but we are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with it. Please do let us know precisely what should be improved in the buffet is it the Indian spread or the action station, etc…yes far most all standard hotels in Sri Lanka by default serve hot beverages either tea or coffee as we have the finest tea & coffee in our country and that the guest can enjoy the true Sri Lankan tea or coffee and yes it is complimentary and all other additional hot beverages are charged extra which as a prestige traveler I am pretty sure you are well aware of it.

We are very surprised of your comment which reflects the overall service of our food court as it is one of guests favorite place to dine as most of our prestige Indian guest has given us very good feedback as we have a dedicated Indian chef to prepare the authentic Indian dishes.
. 
All constructive criticism is most welcomed as we always strive to serve our guests with true Sri Lankan hospitality and highest standards of service. 
Sincerely look forward to welcome you back to our Hotel and to our food court in the very near future to serve you even better.

Thank you,
Ashiq Muhammed

Above all the breakfast buffet was definitely not 5 star quality, the dining hall is completed like a banquet hall- full, coffee is watered down and self served , any orders of cappuccinos or americanos are an added charge.

The food court was the biggest let down, extremely expensive and really mediocre. The food we tried was the Indian and it was salty and the meat hard.

As one of the directors me and my chef with over 12 years of experience at our hotel, I personally prepared your dinner on the second night. I clearly recall that on the first night, both you and your husband enjoyed the pork fillet, which you did not mention in your review. On the second night, you ordered the pasta with Fresh tomato sauce (served without parmesan as per your request), and your husband had the chicken breast.

That evening, our owner Michel spoke with you, and I also came to your table. I remember your husband complimenting the food, telling me it was “excellent and tasty.” At no point were any concerns raised about the food during your stay.

We take great pride in our cuisine and consistently receive positive feedback from guests. If there was any misunderstanding or disappointment, we wish you had brought it to our attention at the time so we could have addressed it immediately.
We’re always open to constructive feedback and remain committed to providing a high standard of hospitality.

Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us. I do take all customer feedback seriously. It is only with comments like yours we can improve our services.

I am very disappointed and surprised to receive your comment for the first time after Trip Advisor found your first comment as violate, after all the Excellent and Very Good reviews about the service level of our staff and the fine culinary experience we offer.
Actually the spa when you asked I told you the therapist is coming from outside and we are starting at 5.00pm onwards and your partner wants to have the message around 2.00pm then I explained to you that I will try to make the appointment by 2.00pm and we were able to make it possible as to your request, and satisfaction.
Actually the laundry was ready on time as our housekeeper promised you but you hang the don’t disturb board on the door that’s why he didn’t come to hand over it and after that when I explained you told me you forgot to remove the DND board and the laundry was not that important the housekeeping can it in the room when the turndown service at the dinner time.
Normally we play soft music in the restaurant actually it’s not from the kitchen before we clean the terrace I personally came to you and asked whether we can clean then you replied it’s ok no problem actually I have to remind you we spoke about the massage in the morning and we fixed the time before you go to the room after the tour at the lobby about 12.30pm
I agree about the squirrel problem I apologise about that actually you inform me about that on the second day evening when I met you at the poolside, you heard a squirrel noise on that time immediately we close the hole unfortunately they came again at 2.30am on that time I arrange a superior room which is the same size as a deluxe what you have originally booked from Booking,com 
As scheduled our staff starts work shifts at 6.30am no way you can hear anyone chatting and banging doors on that time as you have mentioned.
Of course, as a boutique hotel like ours situated in the jungle, these kinds of things can happen seldomly 
Actually, the rice and curry which we prepare for the guest specially for the foreigners we do less chilli because they can’t eat chilli like Sri Lankans that’s why we serve chilli past separate, if we do more chilli you will also complain that the curries are too hot(too spicy)
You informed us about the Birthday at the last minute on that time we couldn’t have time to bake a cake and garnished that in that short period actually your wife and you told me the cake was very good and the same time you offered the cake for the other guests also.
The room was decorated with good balloons by mistake with the balloons there was one balloon mentioned happy wedding.

The only incident which took place was a squeal walking into your room at late night and we took the liberty to readjust your accommodation the best hospitality available at that time 
The allegations you have mentioned in your comment is not accurate therefore we as a recognized hotel we wish to inform you to reconsider your comment

It started badly and just kept getting worse. I know others adore this place. We couldn't wait to leave.

It seems to be run for the benefit of the staff. For example, we tried to book a 2pm spa session and were told we could only have 5pm because the masseur didn't plan to be in until then. We accepted and planned our day. A few hours later we were told the appointment absolutely had to be at 2pm because the masseur had changed his mind.

Laundry promised in the morning was forgotten until the afternoon. When I asked I was promised 10 minutes. It took two hours. 

The kitchen had music blaring when we tried to sit by the pool. Then the grounds staff started sweeping up leaves round our recliners. Having grumbled about the laundry and the massage appointment we gave up and went to our room.

Here we unearthed the cause of the house that kept us awake on our first night - a nest of squirrels playing inside the room around the ceiling. We alerted staff, who took a look and told it was leaves. (The squirrels had gone into hiding.) Leaves? With beady eyes and furry tails? That night the squirrels woke us again and at 2.30am we were moved to a pokey little room. Any chance of sleep ended when staff arrived at 5am or so to chat and bang stuff at the storeroom next to our new room.

The owner is fond of replying on here to issues like this by saying 'Well what do you expect in the forest?' I expect them to take reports of animals in a room seriously and not dismiss them. The same applies to the ant-infested toilets. I expect a forest hotel to clean, sanitise and inspect them.

Two more anecdotes:

When the chef did his rounds after dinner we said we were surprised how tasteless the curry was. He agreed, saying he didn't spice it. He provided spice for customers. What!? This made our driver laugh out loud for some time.

It was my partner's birthday and the hotel offered to make a cake and decorate our room. The cake was bought in from Mango Mango in town, a restaurant the hotel recommended which, when we visited, we left without ordering because it was so miserable.

The birthday room decorations? Six second hand balloons with smudged script on them saying 'Happy Wedding'.

If you felt I was intruding all you had to do was say that we could chat later.

Actually, we decided to cut that trees because the upper parts of the trees have died so we have to very care full of the guest safety and I have the responsibility of the guests who staying with us also due to the bad wind on that days the upper part of the trees may fall down and we can’t wait until the off season as I explain you near the pool side in that case I`m not agree with your comment because we worked with chain saw only for 20minuts on and off and also on that time you were at the pool side and I came to you before we cut the tree we informed about that and your husband said its ok with that and i apologized .

We settled down to enjoy our one free morning  by the pool to find all the hotel washing festooned around the pool fence to dry. Michel then with no warning supervised workmen to cut down a large healthy tree.This involved a very noisy 2hrs of chain sawing. When I approached Michel he failed to apologise but said he couldn't wait until the hotel quiet season as jobs would pile up! We were the only guests at the hotel at this point.
Finally as if to punish us at our last breakfast we essentially got no service while Michel sat by his computer.

I am very disappointed to receive your comment for the second time after TripAdvisor found your first comment as violate, after all the 156 Excellent and Very Good reviews about the service level of our staff and the fine culinary experience we offer. I feel duty bound to take issue with you over your comments about being charged for your espresso coffees, all NINETEEN (19) of them!!! I informed you when you requested double espressos that they would be charged as I explained that any amount of tea or Sri Lankan coffee was free with breakfast but as other styles of coffee are made from a machine with expensive capsules, they have to be charged. It states this clearly on our menu. I actually think that at an average of £2.63 per cup, they were very good value compared to what you would pay in the UK, about the cleanliness of your room. 
Actually, my houseboys are cleaning the rooms twice a day and our supervisors are checking that I can assure you my bed linen are made from cotton, quite incorrect of you to suggest anything other. 
As to my personal style of management of my hotel, I consider it my duty to be friendly with my guests, I am French, it is my natural Gallic way to interact with the people who stay with us. If you felt I was intruding all you had to do was say that we could chat later as you wanted a quiet breakfast time with your wife, I would not have been offended. What does offend me though, are your comments
You did go out one night for dinner and immediately upon return requested dinner at our hotel the following night, as your wife said you hadn’t been happy with what you’d had outside, now you are saying something entirely different. We merely ask our guests if they are enjoying their meal and if everything is alright, as if it isn’t we can immediately change their food. It is only our concern for our guests and their comfort that makes us ask, we are not looking for ‘praise’ of any sort.
I cannot do anything about the lake in front of my hotel; your pickiness knows no boundaries that you can take issue with nature! It hasn’t rained in Sri Lanka for over six months; we are desperately in need of rain and actually pray for it every day. If the ‘tank’ which is what it is actually called, was full then you wouldn’t see the petrified trees.
Wi-Fi signals and strength are a huge problem away from the main cities in Sri Lanka, until the providers upgrade their services it is something totally out of our hands.
Let me finish by saying that you commented in our in-house guest book before you left that “Lovely kind attention hosts and staff it made our stay” so the other readers can make their mind up about you and your comments and judge against all the top-class comments we have received over the years

Sheets not cotton - were they nylon or polyester. Yuk. 
The reservoir an eyesore full of dead trees. Looks like Armagedden.  Note it is NOT a lake its a flooded valley eservoir with half submerged trees ruining the vista.  There are signs with pictures of bloated dead bodies by the shore telling you not to swim. Not for children to see please.
Poor wifi - unusable for Skype or Facetime in the room.  WiFi was fine in a local restaurant where we ate on day 2 so its not poor everywhere despite what may be said.
Surprise invoice warning !!!!!!!!!!!- Unlike every other hotel in the world the inclusive breakfast does NOT include an expresso coffee and you won't be told that until after 3 days an extra 10,000 rupees (about £55) is now on your bill. When you complain (and I did give them the chance to correct matters) you will be fobbed off. I felt ripped off. Nowhere in the world have I had to pay for an expresso coffee with my room inclusive breakfast.
Owner doesn't understand it is not good service to stand over your guests table and invade their meal and private time with a forced 10 minute conversation while you are eating. Politeness stops you from telling him to go away. HIde in a book or mobile phone and let him pick someone else.
This is a poured concrete structure devoid of any ""charm"" and the word ""Boutique"" seems inappropriate. It is a simple hotel with no character and with a small number of rooms. Thats small - not boutique.

Very Very Disappointing - the experience does not correlate with the price or the service. I see the manager is prone to reply to these poor feedback comments defensively.  I only tell it as it is and I did approach the management to communicate my disatisfaction.  Most of my comments are reflected in the same way by other poor reviewers over 24 months so clearly they have yet to take these points on-board and put them right.  It's easy to fob your guests off when they complain but most Brits will simply pay and then spread the word so others don't get caught the same way.

But they said there is no rooms available for three person upon our arrivals and you can have two rooms if you want, which was not acceptable.

While we have received several very positive reviews, for which we thank our valued guests, we have also received some constructive criticism, which we have not replied to, but we have acted on. This particular review however, in our opinion, is biased. We work on the basis of honesty and integrity, and in large part, our guests have been exactly that, for which we are truly grateful. 

The fridge in the room doesn’t have any liquor due to the hotel do not have permits to sell liquor in the premises.
 The bike that we have in the hotel is to provide free to the guest that how stay with us and that we don’t have any mountain to ride here is only flat lands. The bike what we have here is only the standard size bikes. 
In the rooms we have wall fixed international socket that have five different plugging.
The architectural designer in the room that we have two bed side lamps that can be rotatable and adjustable while you’ll reading on the bed. 
With the furniture in the room that we have is to make sure that don’t take lot space in the room. So if we have any large furniture in the room its take lot space in the room. But we have provided furniture like a writing table with a chair and table lamp. In the balcony we have and two chairs and a stool, all this furnishers are make out of wood.   

As a hotel police we don’t keep connections with tuk tuk rides and they charge different rates with each guest. That is a reason we don’t keep connection with the tuk tuk rides. But if a guest asks for a tuk tuk we arrange it but not the rates for the tours. Its up to the guest to be check with the tuk tuk ride
The dead trees in the lake are there for more than hundred years, because this lake was a manmade lake with combining two small lakes together. The trees were cover with water when they combining tow lake together. Now the dead trees help a lot have good bird paradise around this area.
Every night we check with our guest do they like to try some Sri Lankan Breakfast on the next day morning. If they like to try then it has to order before. 
While a guest having there they meal at anytime. We check with our guest that they like the meal that they having is good or bad. If it is something wrong then and there we can change it for our guest. But in this case we check with guest, but he didn’t say anything bad about the meals, if something wrong before the guests eat that can be change and arrange something different. But after having it and say its wrong is easy and can’t help to have it again. 
The rates for the rice & curry what we served can be high for you. But our service what we offer to our guest is different to a small restaurant like on the road where you’ll can find writhen 5KM. 
We are of course open to constructive criticism and will take up some of the other matters the guest has pointed out. Furthermore, we thank the guest for recommending the very villa he stayed in despite his criticism of it.

i) The publicity states that rooms have baths . Room 4 did not .
ii) The advertised "" minibar "" is NOT a bar - it is a fridge with soft drinks in it .
iii) The only English Language TV channel of the 7 or 8 available was Aljazeera . I have been to Sri Lanka on four previous holidays totalling over 40 days and never before found myself in a hotel which did not have channels showing international cricket !
iv) There were 4 "" Mountain "" bikes available for SHORT guests ( none big enough for my 180 cm ) .None had gears ( MOUNTAIN bikes ? ) and they were in a poor state of repair .

Other complaints : -
a) When I pointed out a cockroach to a member of staff checking my oxymoronic "" minibar "" he prodded it with his toe to see whether or not it was alive ( it was ) and watched it scuttle across the floor to hide under the desk . No comment was passed , and no further action was taken during the remaining three hours of my stay .
b) A member of staff had to be called before the lavatory could be induced to flush .
c) Similar assistance was needed before I could begin my fruitless search for cricket on the television ( the plug did not fit the socket ) .
d) The ONLY chair in the spacious room was a folding wooden thing - NOT comfortable .
e) The architect/interior designer did not allow for the possibility of anyone wishing to read after dark . The only way to do so was to take the "" chair "" to one particular corner ( two guests could NOT have read simultaneously )
f) The furniture on the balcony was visually elegant but NOT practical . After at most two minutes reclining in one of the "" sunloungers ( ? ) "" the recliner was decorated with horizontal bars and VERY uncomfortable  .
g) I have consulted staff at hotels all over Asia before taking my first "" tuc-tuc "" from their door ( to find out roughly what my journey should cost ) . Never before has the result been me paying three times the going rate for that first journey .
h) "" Lake Lodge "" should properly be called "" Reservoir Lodge "" . Many apparently enjoyed the view from the terrace - to me the hundreds of dead trees sticking ten to fifteen feet out of the water made it look like the Somme after heavy rain rather than Windermere .

The breakfasts were variable . The first - egg hoppers - was rather good . I asked for egg hoppers on subsequent mornings , but was told this was not possible . I did not understand the reason(s) given for this state of affairs . I did not much enjoy the alternatives .

The evening meals were very poor value for $ 23 . 
Of the three first courses I ate two ( tuna samosas and spring rolls ) bore all the hallmarks of having come from packets of frozen food , and gave little or no pleasure , and the third ( tomato and mozarella salad ) disappointingly tasteless .
Of the three main courses , the Seared Tuna was SUPERB ( the best I have ever tasted ) , the "" Rice with Fish Curry "" was good ( BUT not as good as one costing 800 Rupees I ate subsequently , 5 km away ) , and the "" Rice with Chicken Curry "" was appalling .

Our room was fantastic with great views over the tree canopies to the distant mountain ranges. the room was huge and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Operationally though things leave a lot to be desired and for the money we paid ($265 a night before the added 24% taxes) I would expect a lot more, even taking into account we stayed over the Christmas period. 
For some reason the chef provided us with 'Western' food options which we found strange as surely most tourists coming here would prefer to try Sri Lankan food? In retrospect, and after staying in a couple of other boutique hotels, we probably should have asked for Sri Lankan food but this was never offered as an option. The food we ate was disappointing and tasted as if a lot of it came out of a jar or the freezer. 
Staff were friendly and amiable but hovered around us endlessly fussing. Every meal someone would just appear in front of us, say hello and then not move on when we said hello back - it was quite unnerving as we were often mid conversation ourselves. 
Location wise it is perfect for exploring the Cultural Triangle and if they got the food and service right it I'd have no issues in recommending it to anyone. We have stayed in many boutique hotels around the world and I'm afraid Lake Lodge in no way represents value for money at $265 a night.","Almost ticks all the boxes but vastly overpriced","2012-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d1822843-r149320737-Lake_Lodge_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

We are most distressed to read of your review.  We are also surprised as neither you nor Mr Antonio had mentioned your food poisoning during the 3 days with us.

As you had mentioned,  you did have breakfast the first morning with us.  Following this, you left the hotel at 1.25pm for a few hours.  You had your own driver so we were not aware of where you went.

The next day, you left early for your whale-watching tour and Mr Antonio requested for breakfast packs which we prepared for you.  You returned at 11.30am and left the hotel again at 4pm and returned after dinner.

On your final day, you had to leave early for your flight and again requested for breakfast packs.  As your departure time was brought forward to 3.30am, you changed your mind and told us there was no need for the breakfast packs as it was too early to eat.

During you short stay with us,  you were very friendly towards our on-site staff and said all was well each time we had greeted and offered assistance to you.  You spent a significant amount of time out of our hotel with your driver and did not have any other meals at our hotel.

Our kitchen standards  follow strict hygiene standards. Our fresh foods are delivered every 3 days, and some on a daily basis (such as fruits and eggs) during the high season .  We put a bottle of dried fruits in the room and these come in little vacuum packs which we decant into the crystal bottle in your room prior to arrival.  We do not believe dried and cured fruits would be a likely cause for food poisoning.

We are very sad that you had decided your food poisoning was our absolute fault and have expressed it in such a categoric and degrading manner just only a few hours after leaving our hotel.   We close our hotel every year for one month to refurbish the property entirely.  Being by the Indian Ocean, corrosion happens very fast and there would certainly be wear and tear with time.  In addition, we continue with monthly maintenance but keep that to a minimum to avoid disturbing our guests.

We would never avoid taking responsibility for our mistakes.  However, to unequivocally accept this blame (or even likely blame) for causing your food poisoning and most distressingly, ruining your Sri Lankan hotel seems unfair.  

We respectively deny your claim and humbly request you to reconsider this review.  What is especially unfair to us is that you had not mentioned this matter to us while in-residence but instead, chose to publicly humiliate us almost  immediately after leaving our hotel. 

Regardless,  we wish you and your Mr Antonio speedy recovery good health and that after your emotions have subsided, you would have fond and happy memories of Sri Lanka.

We arrived late afternoon on our first day and were full of excitement at the prospect of relaxing on the beach for some time after travelling the island.  On the first morning of our stay I ate breakfast and went to sunbathe.  An hour or so after eating breakfast whilst on the sun lounger I had to get up and rush to the room as I felt I was going to be sick.  I was sick and continued to be sick for the next 24 hours any time I attempted to eat or drink anything.  I violently vomited at any attempt of drinking liquid even small amounts.  My husband too was sick and is suffering as we leave on our way to the airport.  He also has a compromised immune system due to taking medication for Crohn’s disease so will take him longer to recover and will impact the next part of our journey in Dubai.  The only thing we both ate that could have caused this were eggs at breakfast and the dried fruit and nuts that are provided in the small jar in the room.  I would never normally eat anything like this in a bar where other people’s fingers and germs have touched, but whilst on holiday in a “luxury”  hotel you let your guard down a bit.  Needless to say this totally ruined the time for us and we spent the majority of time in our room feeling rubbish.  When we attempted to go out as we’d booked a private whale  tour, we both felt so awful we just couldn’t wait to get back.  Totally took the shine off for both of us.  The hotel has stunning scenery and I witnessed a beautiful sunset through the gap in the curtains from the bed I was lying in but too sick to get up on the first evening.  The hotel itself is in need of a bit of TLC.  Looks a bit tired in places.  Definitely wasn’t as pristine looking in reality as it looks in the pictures.  I would not come back here.","Would not come back…..what should have been a relaxing experience was the worst experience I’ve felt whilst travelling","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674590-d12225146-r944317339-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

You had gone all out to remind us it was your 25th anniversary and we made every attempt to welcome you including a complimentary airport pick up (worth US$150) even without your asking for it. In that offer, we thanked you for being one of our earliest booker for the season and for supporting the country. We are certain in all your years of travels, that very few hotels would have offered you such a generous and unsolicited gesture.   

Your credit card was invalid four times. We asked repeatedly for an updated credit card. When you did finally provide a valid credit card number just 3 weeks prior to your check-in, you instructed us not to charge it for yet another day (even though your payment was already past due by 8 days). Each email from you was titled “URGENT” - we obliged. 

In the meanwhile, you took that opportunity to re-negotiate your rate. We did indeed have a flash sale but it did not cover the period of your stay. In addition and very importantly, you were not entitled to change your booking under the terms of Booking.com.  Even if there was a special offer (which there wasn’t), you would not have been able to change your booking per the terms of Booking.com.   With that same reasoning, had our rates gone up in the meantime (which is a likely scenario when our hotel is close to full house), we would not expect you to pay more. This is simply double standards on your part.   

We certainly did not blame our close partner Booking.com for anything. You simply wanted a better deal and we were trying to be subtle about it in our reply to you.   

We never talked or communicated with you (or any of our guests for that matter) in a “flat” manner. We explained everything in detail and apologized repeatedly even though we could not understand the justification of your demands. We had even offered an exceptional rate for the suite when we were unable to identify the rate you had demanded.   

It was your emails that were curt, offensive and demanding.  Not ours.  When you didn’t get your way, your final email to us was downright negative and petulant.   After a multitude of emails apologising to you and trying to placate your demands, enough was enough. 

You are right - we really do wish for guests to be happy. We didn’t see fit to have you stay with us.   You were clearly not happy and we didn’t want you to be so on our property. We gave you a full refund without any penalty despite your holding that room for over 3 months without a valid credit card.   Your foreign exchange gripe is solely your individual matter as we only deal in USD.  This has always been the case since the start and with all our honoured guests.

With this unfair and inaccurate “review”, we are glad we made that difficult decision to unwelcome you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Rd, Ahangama 80650 Sri Lanka","Ahangama","Sri Lanka","80650",,"Matara Rd",,"12225146","5.977092","Ahangama, Galle District, Southern Province","80.35261","The Sandhya","228","4.9","3","0","1","5","219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g674590-d12225146-Reviews-The_Sandhya-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://thesandhya.com/","2022-12-31","OTHER","1",,"Value","3","Location","5","Service","1",,,,,,,"In all my days of global travel staying at some of the finest hotels in the world has a hotel canceled my reservation.

I had been greatly looking forward to staying here as the hotel is very beautiful and contemporary. Located right on the beach the location was perfect. I booked this hotel a few moths ago prior to arranging my flights. Understand here that Sri Lanka is not the easiest place to get to. I had gone out of my way to support Sri Lanka as it slowly emerges from the pandemic and the scourge of financial mismanagement.
Some background here. The attempted to charge my credit card as per our agreement and there were a number of issues at my end. My bank thought there was possible fraud and so declined the charge a few days passed as I was travelling I then had them manually put through the charge. 
In the meantime I noticed on the website that the premier suite in the hotel was being offered at the same rate as I was paying for the smaller room. It was showing on Booking.com at a discount of 40%. I said that I was interested in taking advantage of this. 
This offer was priced in C$ on the website. The hotel went and charged my credit card that amount in USD. When I pointed out the error they flatly stated that this was not a valid rate and was an error on the part of booking.com. 
They refunded the difference and reverted back to my original room. Flatly refusing to honour the posted rate or the upgraded room. I pointed this out and without further ado they cxld my booking saying that I was going to be a problem and they wanted nothing further to do with me. I am out the difference in the exchange rate.

We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel. It is through feedback such as yours that we can address areas in which we need to improve and strive to offer a better experience to our guests in the future. 

I am aware our Operations Manager, Mr.Harin Cooray, has responded to your concerns and offered you to contact him directly. In the meantime, please allow me to address your concerns one by one. 

First and foremost, we would like to extend our apologies for the inconveniences you encountered during your stay. It is disappointing to hear about the issues you faced, and we genuinely regret the negative impression that was left. 

Regarding the age verification for your youngest son, we understand that there may have been some confusion during check-in. We apologize for any discomfort this may have caused. As per our policy, like many others in the industry, the children’s rate applies to children under 12 years, and we are obliged to verify the children’s age at the time of check-in. 

However, we do acknowledge the importance of clear communication, and we will work on ensuring that this aspect is more transparent in the future. 

The issue with the resident rate and staff behavior is concerning. We would like to express our sincerest apologies for any insensitivity or misunderstanding you felt from our team. 

Discrimination in any form is unacceptable, and we are committed to providing an inclusive and respectful environment for all our guests. 

Regarding the misunderstanding about the bathroom items, we acknowledge the inconvenience it caused. We apologize for any confusion, and we are grateful that it was resolved satisfactorily. We will use this incident as an opportunity to further train our staff on handling such matters with care and sensitivity. 

We are deeply sorry that the refund process took longer than expected and that you had to resort to a chargeback with your bank. We take full responsibility for processing your refund, and we regret any delay with the refund process. We are grateful that it is now resolved. 

Your concerns are valid, and we understand your frustration. Please rest assured that we are taking your feedback seriously, and we are committed to improving the quality of our services. While we cannot change the past, we hope you will allow us the opportunity to serve you better in the future. 

We hope you allow us another chance to serve you, and we will do our utmost to ensure a superior and more pleasant stay. We value your patronage and trust, and we are determined to learn from our mistakes. 

Thank you once again for your feedback, and we wish you safe and enjoyable travels.

Thank you for taking your time to share your review based on your recent stay with us.

It saddens us to know that your meals were a letdown and that you were not provided with the service standards Jetwing Hotels is known for.

We have currently discontinued the usage of French fries in our menus as it is an imported product and French fries cannot be produced from local potatoes. Hence, we use potato wedges as a substitute. But we understand that these factors need to be properly communicated to you and we apologize for failing to do so.

His argument was that I have misplaced somewhere.  
Fortunately, We had taken photos while having lunch in our table which had my phone and wallet together with time tag and it was obvious during the time we left the table to serve deserts that one of the waiter nicked the wallet because they were frequently clearing plates.

I would sincerely like to apologize for your experience at Jetwing Lagoon. While we always strive to meet guest expectations, we have clearly failed on this occasion. 

I have spoken to Sasini who made the booking and got full details of the experience. Again my sincere apologies for failing to meet your expectations with the choice of menu offered. 

I have invited Sasini to be hosted for a Jetwing experience to which she has agreed in the future and would love to extend the same to you on your next visit to Sri Lanka.     

Further while we offer swimming pool facilities complimentary to our in house guests and restaurant patrons, we do have a cover charge of Rs 2000 for any outside guest who would love to enjoy a swim in our 100 meter pool.

Looking forward to hosting Sasini and yourself to a Jetwing experience in the future.

We had been here a few years ago and had enjoyed our stay; likewise, my parents stopped off here once and gave the hotel a glowing review.

This time however, our stay was tainted by various deficiencies. Had we been staying at a mid-range hotel, we may not have been bothered to call these out. Jetwing Lagoon, however, is extremely expensive (we're talking Western prices or more; this extreme pricing is a phenomenon across the whole of Sri Lanka, but that topic deserves a separate post in its own right) - we paid USD 201 for one night, plus a USD 90 late checkout fee. At that price, you expect immaculate, standout service - but this was far from the case.

First, the positives:

- The hotel is a short distance away from Bandaranaike Airport (c. 20 minutes by car) and is therefore convenient as a pre-departure or post-arrival stop-off (central Colombo, by comparison, is at least 60 minutes by car, depending on your exact destination and traffic).

- The vast, 100m pool that forms the centrepiece of the property is stunning.

- The Geoffrey Bava architecture is pleasing, although perhaps not for everyone (the concrete paths leading to the rooms and the flooring around the central pool are very rough and not easy to navigate barefoot).

- The rooms are immensely spacious - exactly what one needs after (or before) being cooped up in an aircraft for hours.

Now, the negative:

- We arrived at around 4 a.m. and made it clear to the lady at the front desk that we wanted to rest. At 9 a.m. the same morning, we received a wake-up call from reception; when we pointed out the error, the lady simply said ""Oh, wrong number"", and hung up. This was both woefully unprofessional and disruptive, and we called back to complain later in the day, only to be met with a relatively dismissive and brief apology. In any top-range hotel, we would have expected that someone would take this issue up with us at the point of checkout, at the latest. But on checking out, we weren't even asked whether we had enjoyed our stay - we were simply presented with the bill very indifferently; clearly no-one had registered, let alone escalated our earlier complaint. We therefore spoke to the deputy general manager and then the general manager; both offered an apology but had nothing constructive or reassuring to say.

Bottom line, the staff are largely untrained in customer service, and this is very noticeable in comparison with the level of attention offered to guests at other top hotels.

- We had lunch in the restaurant by the lagoon. The food was good, but the number of flies buzzing around the table made it difficult to enjoy the meal. Guests at the neighbouring table were likewise struggling with the insect invasion. Clearly the hotel has little control over the proliferation of bugs, but we felt they could have prepared the tables better - e.g. by providing lids for the curry pots. A waitress came to our rescue by draping some paper serviettes over our food. We appreciated the gesture but it actually just demonstrated how weakly the hotel addresses (or doesn't address) the issue.

- The lunch service was extremely slow, even though there weren't many guests in the restaurant. Even a simple tea and plate of curd took around 25 minutes to arrive (we actually walked around the gardens while waiting for it).

- The lawns in the gardens were still full of paper scraps and burnt-out rockets from the recent new year celebrations. Again, one would not expect this lack of cleanliness from a hotel aspiring to be top-class.

Overall, a nice place, but suffering from some very serious deficiencies which seem due to inadequate staff training and poor management. We felt we were being fleeced for money and did not feel cared for.

In the response to this review, it would be nice to read some truly thoughtful suggestions for improvement rather than the cut-and-paste platitudes that characterise the responses to most of the other reviews.","Paradise lost","2019-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r643342205-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

So why does the company think it’s ok to fail to warn visitors in advance and instead dupe people into paying to stay when the pool is closed)? Jetwing operate several other hotels in Negombo so it would be simple to offer alternative accommodation. 
So instead of the widely hyped pool, we had building work and aroma of tile adhesive. 
We found the staff friendly and doing the best they could in the circumstances but this is a hopelessly awful place to stay at the moment. 
There’s another small pool on the rather nasty beach (lucky as swimming is not allowed - nor is it in the lagoon, which again is not clear till you arrive.)
Aside from the pool, the open air bathrooms just don’t work here - being by a busy road and some scruffy housing rather takes the edge off the experience.
Sadly a bad way to end a fantastic trip to Sri Lanka.","Shame on you Jetwing","2018-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r603994836-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

One of the worst experience ever at a 5 star hotel. This menu is what was offered for lunch today. Jetwin lagoon has taken the word ""set menu"" to another low level. Meaning of ""set menue"" ;a complete meal with a limited number of options to choose from each course. If you are not sure check it up. Kindly point out to me which ""OPTION"". It felt as if we should eat this or just starve. Which my little daughter had to untill we got her something from another restaurant outside after we left. They didnt offer an option or neither a kids meal for my daughter. A 5 star property to serve what we could get in any cheap market. I'm just appalled. Iv never got such bad service in any of the other jetwin properties special attention was always given to the kids aswell. We pay good money to receive a 5 star service but sadly this is what we get. Even last night's set menu was disappointing when I requested for a simple cheese pasta for my daughter they refused and wanted us to select an option of hotdog, chicken nuggets or fish nuggets.. options you can get in a fast food restaurant....
 When we get to the front desk to checkout hungry and annoyed the girl at the front desk tells us ""this what we told you that it's a set  menu.."" cherry on the  top.. just what we needed to hear.. once again teach them the correct definition on the word set menu.  The front desk manager wanted to know why we didn't ask for option from the A la carte? When we question the kitchen they said we need to make an additional payment. Mind you after we payed for a full board option. which we didn't pay for eventually since we didn't want to eat a rice and curry. The front office manager apologised and a bunny was brought to the vehicle. A soft toy jetwin gives the kids when they check in usually.That  didn't fill my little girls tummy now did it?

We were referred by an expat that stayed in the hotel previously.  However, the property did not live up to our expectations.  

The hotel touts ocean front/sea side and beach access.  Yes, there is access to sand across a busy road.  However, you can not swim in the ocean.  The hotel has built a pool ""oceanside"".  The lagoon side is a nice view, but it doesn't give the ""resort"" feel.

Our room was the Bawa Suite.  While it appeared perfect on initial review, the bathroom did not have proper circulation and was like a sauna with no circulation and excessively humid.  The room was not as clean as I expected and found random hairs in the bathroom.  Very gross.

There is nothing within walking distance so we opted to eat lunch on the property.  Everything we ordered was edible but not fantastic.  Everything that was fried was extra greasy (egg rolls, seafood, etc).  We did not stay for breakfast.

The worst part of the experience had to be the staff at the ""welcome"" desk.  I asked transportation to the city and the receptionist quoted me DOUBLE the price of Pickme or Kangaroo Cabs for a smaller/non-AC vehicle.  She also steered me toward a tuk-tuk that was also overpriced.  So, my husband I and walked the road until we were able to get a reasonably priced taxi service.

I was so dissatisfied with the service, we checked out six hours after check-in, even though I prepaid for the room.  Even upon check-out, the reception staff didn't seem concerned or interested in the issues.

I would not recommend this hotel to an enemy.","If you are looking for luxury and true 5 star quality and service...this is not the place for you!","2018-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r569734260-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience on TripAdvisor following your stay at our resort. 

We are sorry to read that you did not enjoy your stay with us, and please accept my most sincere apologies on behalf of the team at the resort. 

We do appreciate your feedback on the level of air-conditioning inside the rooms which you felt was not adequate enough, as well as for the delay in getting a taxi at reception which should not have happened. 

The resort has a spa and ayurveda centre as well as a  fully equipped gym, we are very sorry once again if this information was not given to you upon check in.  As it was a day of very low occupancy we had to opt for an ala carte breakfast.  

I have shared your views and comments with my team to ensure that we stay focused always and maintain consistency in our services. As you may have noticed the resort is more situated in a tranquil location with the Indian ocean on the west coast and the large Negombo lagoon on the east. 

Please know we deeply regret your experience at our resort and we can't say sorry enough to make it up to you. All we could do is to promise that if you decide to give us another opportunity, we will assure it will be a much better stay experience. Till then we wish you all the best in your future travels.

First of all our booking was for some reason under different name and so despite arriving at 1am in the morning, being tired and having a voucher, I had to wait over half an hour for the staff to finally agree that yes, it was our booking. 

Secondly the staff was not communicating very well and judging by their body language and facial expressions, they were annoyed that they were bothered by someone who actually wanted to get what they paid for. Also when we finally got our room, the porter let me carry my own bags and then actually expected a tip once he showed me to my room. 

Otherwise the rooms were beautiful and with the outdoors bathroom it felt special. Shame that the customer service completely destroyed this experience and the price we paid was definitely not corresponding to the service.","Pricetag & service do not match","2017-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r463974468-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Good for stopover after or before flights as 20 mins from airport  for 1-2  nights 
It trades on mentioning it's a Geoffrey Bawa design - rooms are large stylish with huge bathroom with open roofed edges . Very impressive 
Linens good and toiletries are topped up (sometimes ) and reused - a plus 

The table / bar service is slow - u could lose interest by the time it arrives
Tho they top your wine glass up so regularly it's annoying . I think they must have had a talk about extra selling!
The main pool is huge and clean 

The sea side pool is ok - unloved tho satisfactory and can be empty a lot of the time so very nice swimming to crashing waves 

The beach is black sand and full of rubbish 

The sea is rough - no swimming - with waves crashing on a rock shelf 
One is hard pushed to say anything nice about beach really so am
Puzzled by other reviews praising beach 

Internet very patchy in our rooms and around site . Very poor connection and slow 

If room numbers are low there is fixed menu but the  cooking was very good indeed and after the press of the buffets it was relaxing to have table service . But you never knew type of meal on offer til you sat down 

I think it has potential to improve / but trading on airport proximity and bawa link . A bit sad

I booked a triple through Agoda and clearly stated that our party included 2 adults and one child of 12. The room was a triple. Agoda said the room was fine for 3 adults so I went ahead and paid the very large amount - one that we wouldn’t usually pay - for a special event - about $750 AUD. By far the most expensive hotel I have ever booked. We arrived. The gardens are lovely and the staff are decent. That’s where the good ends. We booked a garden view - the room has a view of a car park (currently in the hotel at night or I would take a picture). The beds are hard. The hotel is extremely dated and needs a good refurb. So I am already annoyed that we got terrible value for money. We took a stroll and upon return the staff inform me we have to pay another $165usd for my child - who to them is an ‘adult’ (she’s twelve remember). I checked their website and sure enough it says a 12 year old is an adult - so I tried to ‘rebook’ with Agoda and sure enough it still says the triple is for 3 adults…though it also says ‘children under 11 stay for free’ if you click on a very small ‘I’ - at the very least unclear - but also, I booked well in advance (and paid in advance) and there was no other mention of an additional fee - or what that additional fee would be. So, all in all, not a good experience. Even without the extra $165 usd slug this hotel is just very poor value for money. And on top of all of that breakfast is not included. So, in sum, well over $1000 aud and no breakfast for a dated hotel. Absolutely terrible value - an experience worth $400 aud tops (and that’s being generous and factoring in the peak season and historical nature of the hotel…).","Very disappointed and terrible value for money","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r987939391-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

1. Two towels in the bathroom+ wash room: how to you imagine using the same towel for both face and back side ? this is not hygiénique.  
2. The dinner and breakfast food choices and quality is simply bad. Check that out the dried string hoppers, left over food, dried. Not sure if the hotel has the capability to deliver ""Fine Dining"" at the TCK 6685 Restaurant.
3. Instant coffee for breakfast, this is a shame. Luxury hotels serve hot, brewed coffee.
4. Why is water charged at the table, can you not have the option to server free water?

The hotel has been capitalizing on its colonial history, but it’s time to look ahead. How do you envision positioning yourself in the hill country as a hotel that offers a unique experience to travelers ? This is certainly in the hands of the management to create a powerful vision for the future. 

 Besides sticking reminders in the bathroom on the number of liters of water per minute: what are you really doing to be a meaningful greener hotel ?

The surrounding region grows vegetables perhaps for the entire country, however we do not see them either for dinner and or breakfast.","Poor Quality: fails to meet expectations significantly.","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r986526208-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We were a group of 20 ppl and they forced us to have a set dinner menu (€65 each person, way too expensive) instead of letting us use the buffet with the explanation that ‘we were too many’, honestly I don’t see their point but we didn’t want to argue. Moreover the aperitivo was way too expensive for the quality of the wine they offer. Some of the staff member was very polite, other not at all.

(What’s even funny is that our driver who was born and raised in this country said this is the place he least wanted to come to because not only is the hotel mediocre, but the entire area is desolate, like a wilderness, with almost nothing to do and nowhere to go）

I found here interesting because of the severe racism and the sense of being offended. Originally I was born in China, now I and my wife live in New York. Things happen in our first night dinner in this hotel, three ridiculous things happen:

1. Dinner buffet is included in most of packages, but if you order extra beverages you’ll be charged, which is quite normal and even a common sense, but waiters here keep asking Chinese/Asian Yellow visitors if they know something would be charged, more than one time, even after people saying that they know the rules.

2. I ordered a “Ice black coffee with no sugar and milk”, the staffs here, their English is not good though, I carefully  slow down my talking speed, 1 minute after, a waiter came to me asking if I know this coffee would be charged, I said nicely to him: “yes, absolutely, no problem”. After about 5 mins, he came back to me and asked again “Sir this coffee is chargable”, I replied to him “Yes, I know, thank you”. Things got worse when they finally served this “ice black coffee” which is absolutely not what I want, it looks purely white and tastes sweet”, I called the waiter asking if this is black coffee, he started to laugh and reject to admit that this was the wrong one. In order to verify if it’s my problem, after dinner I went to the bar and ordered the same thing “ice black coffee”, this time they did it correctly, which, on the contrary, proved that I was being cheated and offended in the dining room.

In the bar, again, a young Asian couple came in and ordered some drinks with influent English while I was enjoying my black coffee, I heard that they asked them the same issue about the charge at least twice, I don’t understand why they kept doing this.

3. A racist European woman. While we were eating, she sat next to our table with a man. She called over the waiter and suddenly asked him, ""How do you handle leftovers” The waiter was puzzled and replied, ""We usually calculate the supply well, and guests can consume what we offer."" Then, in a sarcastic tone (perhaps she thought I couldn't understand English), the woman asked, ""Why are some people here keeps eating and eating? I don't understand. As of me, I only eat a little bit of vegetables.""        I didn't understand why she would ask such a biased and malicious question, at a time when guests just started their dinner( about 7:50 pm the dinner starts at 7:30 pm). Since my parents were also present, I didn't want to confront her. In the end, we only left some pasta unfinished, with hardly any leftover. However, the waiter didn't seem to recognize her as a racist, or perhaps such racists are particularly welcomed at this hotel.

Further things to be known for those who are planning to come to this hotel: unstable wifi, inconvenient traffic, unstable electricity (it has tripped three times within one hour after check-in)

To sum up personally, I would definitely not come again.","This Hotel is full of “interesting” things","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r951920958-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share with us your feedback regarding your recent stay at our property. Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconveniences. As a hospitality company that prides itself on our service and facilities, guest feedback is of utmost importance. However, we understand that not all guests are alike and what one may find satisfactory may be perceived differently by another.

We vehemently deny any allegations on discrimination, especially against women. We promote an environment that is free from discrimination and without any class divide especially as we work with local communities. We can assure you that we have strict policies against any form of discriminatory behaviour. Our managerial staff undergo regular training to uphold professional conduct and treat all guests with the utmost respect. We sincerely regret if you felt otherwise, but we have found no evidence to support the characterization of our manager-level employees. We also wish you brought this to our attention whilst in-house in order to address this directly. 
Kindly note that wages paid to tea pluckers within our grounds is fair and transparent; as such we have enjoyed long standing relationships with these ladies and their families going back to generations. Your comments on community behaviour are rather appalling as well and we cannot assent to same. 

With regards to your feedback on hotel information, although our staff is well informed, we have taken this constructively and escalated to relevant department in order to minimise similar feedback. On transportation, we aim to offer transparent and competitive pricing for our car services. Your comments however, will be taken into account as we assess our offerings.

We hope this experience would not deter you from visiting us again in the future. 

Yours Sincerely, Roshanlal Perera, General Manager, Heritance Tea Factory.

With regards to your review shared on TripAdvisor and our investigation in to the matter it was revealed that the hotel did their utmost during your stay to ensure that your experience at our unique theme hotel, Heritance Tea Factory, was a memorable one.

Kindly note that with regards to the music from the village kovil, we do hope you understand that this is beyond our control. As an Aitken Spence Hotel, Heritance Tea Factory  practice a sustainable living and community model where we encourage guests to enjoy the locality of the area the hotels are built on. While many of our guests enjoyed this music which went on till 7.30 p.m with light drumming continuing only till 9.00 p.m and picking up again approx. 7.30 a.m the next day, is its regrettable that your sentiments differed. 

We do also have on record your request for a 30% discount citing same along with a late checkout the next day. Our Assistant Resident Manager has, for this request, offered 15% discount with late checkout and an upgrade to the Executive Floor as a gesture of good will; which you have refused. 

We also note that the windows in your rooms were kept open during your stay; which the hotel staff including Front Office associates have advised to be kept closed due to the weather and also to prevent the sound from the area disturbing you as you have mentioned. Our rooms are well equipped with necessary fans and heating equipment for the comfort of our guests; and we do wish that the advise was heeded to, so that your holiday with us would have been more enjoyable. 

On day of departure as well, you have requested for late checkout which we have complied to as a gesture of good will, and have also waived off your extra charges. 

It is never our intention to provide any of our guests with a service or holiday that does not fully meet with or exceed expectations.  In fact, it is our intention to always offer the best possible service for every aspect of our guest’s holiday.  Feedback we receive is therefore of the utmost importance to us.

Whilst we feel it is important to note that Heritance Tea Factory is a popular choice amongst our customers, which generally achieves a high proportion of positive feedback, it is not to say that your concerns have been dismissed.  Indeed, we acknowledge that our customers are all different and that what may be perfectly agreeable to some guests, may not be at all in line with the requirements and expectations of others.  We have therefore made note of your constructive feedback on staff and will look in to same in future trainings and apologise for any inconveniences caused.

We do hope that this will not deter you from enjoying Aitken Spence hospitality at any of our other properties.

Yours Sincerely, Roshanlal Perera, General Manager, Heritance Tea Factory.

one of the worst, overrated hotels I ever been to. on top of that comes the hotel  management  
( Priyan Suwathilake Hotel Front office manager  should be in the hospitality )

On the first day of the stay, around 5:30 pm Tamil celebratory music started playing very loudly from the kovil in the adjacent village. We didn’t mind at first but it was played loudly for hours till night and the music was back before dawn and played for 2 hours and interrupted hour sleep. Then, we called the reception asked about the loud music played and when is it going to stop, we were asked to wait for their response but was ignored. When we contacted the reception again, they were unable to give a proper explanation nor were understood from our perspective. The staff at the reception gave the contact of the resort manager, Priyan Suwathilake and asked to make a complaint to the manager.

When we spoke to the manager he wasn’t sure when the music is going to stop and we were offered an executive room which felt like a downgrade from the room we already were in. And we book this room especially because of the 300°view and space. Around noon the resort manager got back to us and offered 10% off one night but did not take an action to make us at ease and was inconsiderate about our inconvenience.","Bad Management and customer service.","2019-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r728800648-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Following your feedback we have immediately informed the Housekeeping team about the cleanliness and Food & Beverage team on the offered plate of pineapples advising to take necessary measures to enhance the same. 

Kindly note that the rooms are allocated according to the occupancy and saddened that your expectations of the room was not met. 

As Heritance Tea Factory is a longstanding factory converted in to a hotel we hope our guests understand that they are surrounded by gypsum walls as we inform our guests about it. However, the walls are made so that the noise could be heard only at a certain level of decibels. We have already addressed the condition of the curtain holder and rectified this.

Pros: 
- Decent night’s sleep
- Comfy room
- Friendly staff
- Room-switch on request when we were promised amazing views and had the view of a chimney and scaffolding
- Impressive old tea factory conversion with all the old workings and the lobby is quite impressive to look at 

Cons:
- Long, long drive up very narrow roads to reach it, only to be underwhelmed when you finally get there
- Not all rooms promise the amazing views
- Very old fashioned (there’s a pretentious dinner dress code. We ordered room service as this put us off) Women also seemed to be bundled into the category of liabilities along with children and disabled in the event of a fire. Found this sexist and old fashioned. 
- Strange vibes and regimented feeling
- Fairly average food
- Nothing to do 
- Dated room decor

There are many great hotels in close proximity to this location, some even have direct access to a Mall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The ITC Ratnadipa Colombo undoubtedly makes an impressive first impression, with its striking architecture and stunning nighttime lighting.

The suspended bridge bar offers good cocktails and wine, and the live entertainment was exceptional, but unfortunately, these were the only highlights of our stay.

From check-in, it became evident that form had been prioritized over function. Despite being a Marriott Bonvoy Lifetime Platinum Elite Member, there was no recognition or acknowledgment of status.

We had booked a Tower Suite with a sea-facing balcony, but it turned out to be a cramped studio-style room with poor design choices. The kidney-shaped layout made it awkwardly configured, with no full-length mirror, a large luggage room with a faulty light sensor, and a bathroom lacking basic amenities, including an insufficient supply of toilet paper. The spacious shower area had a misplaced shower head, causing water to leak into the bathroom.

The balcony was long but impractical, with an outward-opening door that, due to high winds, became difficult—if not impossible, to close. Though the view was excellent, the wind made spending time outside unbearable.

Service & Housekeeping Issues:
Housekeeping was unreliable, welcome fruits and canapés remained in the room for three days, rotting and covered in mold, despite repeated requests for removal.

Room service was appalling, more than half of the advertised menu was unavailable, and the limited options that were available were of subpar quality.

The 24-hour restaurant faced the same issue, many dishes were simply not available, and what was available did not meet expectations.

The TV inexplicably turned on at high volume at random hours of the night, requiring an engineer’s intervention on two of the three nights we stayed.

Location & Accessibility:
Unlike other luxury hotels in Colombo, ITC Ratnadipa has no attached shopping mall. Guests must walk along the main road and pass through multiple security checkpoints just to reach the Shangri-La’s mall next door, which is an inconvenience for a hotel of this category.

🤬A Frustrating Check-Out Experience:
After three nights of disappointing service and an overall lack of entertainment, we decided to check out early and move next door to the Shangri-La Hotel. However, this turned into an unnecessary ordeal.

Although the Marriott Bonvoy app listed no extended stay requirements, the hotel attempted to charge us for the full seven nights.

Despite notifying the reception the night before and receiving confirmation that our early departure would not be an issue, the check-out staff refused to acknowledge it.

The situation escalated when the receptionist became rude and aggressive, dismissing our confirmed reservation terms and insisting that ITC Ratnadipa had separate, unadvertised policies.

After a series of frustrating calls to the Marriott Bonvoy Help Desk, they confirmed that the hotel was in the wrong and escalated the issue. Eventually, an assistant manager intervened, resolving the matter after nearly three hours of unnecessary back-and-forth.

☝️Final Verdict:
While the ITC Ratnadipa Colombo looks spectacular from the outside, the poorly designed rooms, inconsistent service, lack of essential amenities, and unprofessional check-out process made this one of the most disappointing luxury hotel experiences we’ve had. After moving to the Shangri-La next door, we finally received the level of service and comfort we had expected in the first place.

As Marriott Platinum members, we expected a smooth check-in process and fair treatment, but what we experienced was the opposite.

Deceptive Room Allocation

Upon arrival Sunday night, we were assigned an ITC One City View room despite having booked a waterfront room. The hotel misleadingly claimed this was an ""upgrade"" and justified the switch by stating that a ""waterbody"" within the complex technically qualifies as a waterfront view—a blatantly deceptive tactic. The expectation when booking a waterfront room is a clear view of the Indian Ocean, not an artificial water feature facing the city. This approach suggests the hotel arbitrarily assigns rooms while misleading customers about what they are actually getting.

When we insisted on the Indian Ocean view room we originally booked, we were told that ocean-facing rooms are all suites and that they could not upgrade us to one. This refusal seemed arbitrary, especially considering our loyalty status with Marriott. We ultimately declined the so-called ""upgrade"" and accepted the room we had booked—one with an Indian Ocean and pool view.

Manipulative Upgrade Process

To make matters worse, next day after dining at their fine dining restaurant Avartana, we received a call from reception offering an upgrade to an oceanfront suite—the same upgrade that was denied at check-in, a night before. This sudden reversal was deeply frustrating, as it implied that the hotel deliberately withheld an upgrade that was available all along. It raises serious concerns about preferential treatment and whether upgrades are being handed out based on who attends their complimentary cocktail hour versus who chooses to spend money at their paid dining venues.

This behavior suggests a transactional and discriminatory approach to customer service rather than a genuine commitment to hospitality. If the upgrade was available, why wasn’t it offered at check-in? It leaves the impression that they prioritize certain guests over others based on arbitrary factors, rather than honoring loyalty and fair policies.

Final Thoughts

While the property itself may have luxurious facilities, the dishonest room allocation, unreliable upgrade process, and favoritism in guest treatment made for a disappointing experience. It left a negative impression of the ITC brand, one that suggests they are willing to mislead customers and manipulate upgrades rather than fostering genuine goodwill.

Would we return? Unlikely. Trust is key in luxury hospitality, and ITC Ratnadipa Colombo fell short.","Deceptive Room Allocation & Unreliable Service – Disappointing Stay","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r995353612-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The confusion started on check in where the lady asked for my travelling companion's (my sister) email address.  From then on, they presumed that she was the lead traveller, despite the booking being in my name and they already had all my details as a Bonvoy gold member.  So her name appeared on the tv screen and on the room iPad.  When I brought this to the attention of Reception, they blamed it on an IT glitch and advised that it would be changed.  It wasn't.  Another hotel employee also approached me at breakfast on the second day and assured me it had been rectified.  It still wasn't.

On checkout, I brought it to their attention again and they assured me everything was fixed.  Except it wasn't and my sister has received two emails since we left.

All this hotel had to do was check my Bonvoy account to see my correct email address.

So if a hotel cannot get your name right, then all the other fancy touches are just window dressing.

- The check process in took about 45 minutes and only happened after we asked twice why there was such a delay. It took over an hour to be allowed into our room despite arriving 2 hours after the scheduled check in time.
- We were told by different staff in the hotel that the breakfast was in different levels and spaces in the hotel. Even concierge and the hotel front of desk staff were confused as to where the breakfast was. Eventually I had to physically walk to both supposed breakfast areas and ask the restaurant staff at the each restaurant if they were hosting the breakfast the following morning.
- Upon arriving to the happy hour bar lounge we were told that it was full and we would have to go elsewhere. Despite that just a few seconds later,  another couple were immediately to a seat. I then had to physically show the hotel bar staff that there were free tables and seats available and demand we be given a seat. When we were sat down, our order was not taken at all. We were left to walk up to the bar ourselves to order a drink. 
- We were staying at the hotel for two nights and our room was not cleaned or serviced. Only when I called at 6pm did someone turn up and offer to clean the room.
- The hotel despite not cleaning our room had then had the audacity to then call us to check when we were leaving the following day.

I should've known something was out of sorts when the check-in staff welcomed me as a Bonvoy Member when my booking was done via Club ITC. On pointing out the same, they were confused as to how this happened. It's an impressive property, newly opened, on the Colombo sea front, bang next to Shangrila & OGF Mall. Just that no one knows what's happening, from the Front Office Staff to the restaurant staff and Duty Manager. Having checked in at around 245 pm, we went to the 'all day diner' only to be told they shut shop at 3pm. When I mentioned this to someone later, they apologised for the 'miscommunication'. Ahasa, the lounge bar on the 29th level is very good, again the service is a tad slow. They stress on prior reservations despite empty tables. Silver Tips, the cocktail bar at Lobby Level is a huge disappointment. Planned to have something light at Avartana, their fine dining restaurant but the bare minimum was a 7 course set menu. Great ambience, though. Finally ordered room service, only to be told that since the front office hadn't done a pre-authorization on check-in, as I wasn't entitled for signing any bills to be paid on checkout. Only cash. This is despite paying the room tariff in full. Took me about a dozen calls including two to Duty Manager Kevin who finally got things sorted out. Note - The elevators have a mind of their own, especially level 26. Keep jumping up & down and suddenly stop at any floor. The hotel staff accepted that this was an ongoing issue, unresolved till date. Spotted the huge resident cockroach in the wash room on the day of checkout, didn't bother to inform anyone as we were just leaving. Till the management doesn't hammer out these issues and the staff don't get trained properly, I wouldn't bother visiting this place again. Having said that, it looks great

The reservation process was tedious with calls being unanswered - voice mail box being full - transferred from one desk to another. It was chaotic to say the least.

We were there at 5PM and these are few observations:
- There are too many staff giving orders to others but only one or two to actually get the job done
- The waiter/server looked uninterested and tired. When we asked him about what cocktails he would recommend - he just said there are 10 on the menu (we asked him twice thinking he misunderstood the question). We ended up skipping the cocktails. 
- The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. 
- The attitude of staff was of wanting and showed that there is lack of training. In the hospitality sector - service is king. Unfortunately, it was very basic and very poor at ITC.
- The POS machine had no connection but the server/waiter said that the cards (my friend gave two cards to try) is not working. Anyway, after I paid in cash, he came back and said Rs 5000 is short. I gave him the proper amount but he maintained it wasn't the case and luckily I saw a note on the floor and directed him to that. He didn't apologise - nothing. It was appalling. 

Unfortunately, the experience for the three of us was terrible. There are plenty of other options in Colombo  and when the hype dies down, ITC will struggle to retain the customers if they dont invest in training their staff.

The only people we found being nice and cordial are - the young lady manning the washrooms just outside Ahasa and the Doorman at the entrance.","Poor service","2024-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r950774073-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Finally, when we managed to get through, the reservation agent informed us that they didn't offer high tea, which was disappointing. When we requested the lunch buffet, we were informed that the restaurant was fully booked.

 

In an attempt to salvage the occasion, we drove to the hotel and tried to go to the bar for cocktails. However, we were stopped by security and informed that the hotel was at full capacity. This experience marked the first time in 30 years as guests that we were turned away due to the hotel being full.

In addition to this confusion, we encountered other issues such as poor customer service, having to repeatedly request basic amenities like mixes topping up, and receiving unpolished cutlery with water marks. 

Despite these shortcomings, the menu showed promise. However, the overall execution and service fell short of expectations. This is not the first time we visited ITC. Very poor customer service!
