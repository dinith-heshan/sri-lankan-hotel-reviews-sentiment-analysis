Overrated. 

I’ll start with the positives: 

-Rooms are nice and spacious, maybe a touch dated but overall solid quality. Outdoor pool is good but again pretty dated. 

-Food is awesome. Not the best we had in Sri Lanka but very solid cooking. 

Now the negatives:

-Safaris are laughable. This was supposed to be the highlight of the stay and the reason to go to Yala. Our guide was essentially useless - did not point things out, just sat in the car. Driving was erratic at best and dangerous at worst. We almost canceled the rest of our stay after the first night it was so bad. 

-Management was nowhere to be found. We brought up our negative safari experience to the front desk and asked to speak with a manager - this resulted in them sending over the safari guide who we proceeded to have a highly confrontational, uncomfortable, and awkward conversation with. 

-The wine list is comically bad. For an all-inclusive hotel priced at $1500+/night I expect better than $5/bottle wine. And even the options to purchase were limited / uninteresting. 

At the end of the day, there are FAR better resorts for FAR less $ in Sri Lanka. Shoutout to Haritha Villas & Spa in Hikkaduwa (for example). 

Uga Chena is way overhyped and incredibly overpriced.

Though the overall trip to the hotel was good in terms of the game drives, the facilities and the food, we had serious concerns about the cleanliness and hygiene of the rooms.

I understand that we are in a National Park so there are lots of wild animals and it’s possible a small one can find it’s way into a room. However we did not expect that a rat would have made a home in our mini fridge.

We had to wake up at 5am for a game drive  and from midnight till 3am we were not able to sleep because we kept hearing plastic noises from the mini bar. What was later found to be the rat tugging away at the packet of complimentary cookies.

We had to call the reception and complain 5 times until they finally woke up some people and sent them to our room. After that the guys did not find anything so I told them I have seen the rat and it is probably inside the body of the fridge. Since it wasn’t going to come out itself I told them they might as well pick up the fridge and move it out of the room. As soon as they picked up the fridge the entire floor below it was covered with rat droppings.

The next morning housekeeping cleaned it up and replaced the fridge but surprisingly after this whole experience the manager said that we take your word for it because we didn’t find anything. They denied the whole experience that took place at night and covered it all up while we were on the game drive.

We spent the next 2 days fighting it out with the management and demanded a basic compensation of a 1 night refund since our first night out of only 2 nights was entirely ruined and we got no sleep at all. However they never owned up and took any action. Our agent continued to fight with them for 2 more weeks and they cold to be bothered.

It is a beautiful property but I would be seriously concerned about the hygiene levels. I can understand a raccoon or squirrel in the room but not a rat. The customer service of the management is far from 5 star despite the restaurant staff, chefs and facilities overall being amazing.","There was a rat in the room!!","2018-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r573862201-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for staying at Chena Huts. We are pleased to know that you were happy with the quality of our cuisine and comfort design of the rooms.

Having 14 luxury cabins and offering an All Inclusive service to our guests we are of the opinion that one restaurant would be sufficient offering a-la carte and customized cuisine with both indoor and outdoor dining. In  addition we also offer private dining experiences at special locations on request. 

While we have constant positive feedback on our spa and therapists from other guests we are happy to note that you had continued to book treatments though out your stay. 

You feedback is appreciated since we strive to continuously improve our guest experience.

-Rooms: are well equipped and comfort design, but too dark and is a pity when nature outside is wonderful..!Try to avoid interior bungalows and choose facing the beach or lagoon. Must say that they help us to have a good location when we ask her. Poor snack amenities
-Spa: Not the best in Sri Lanka, was just ok, but was easy to book even with rains
-Restaurant: Only one, and not integrated in such a beautiful place, windows all around feeling like you are in a jail, and you have to ask to dinner or breakfast outside in the terrace. My advise: They can put some big sunshades to enjoy more the terrace-beach even if rains because it worth
-Food: dinner food and wine was very good all the time. But not for breakfast where food was medium 
-Staff: very friendly and helpful but the manager should do more efforts to put more happiness in the air, including herself
-Safari: good vehicles with snacks and drinks and good driver and guide (Janick if I'm not bad...) but in my opinion Yala is not the place to do Safaris. You can find 75% more animals in Kenia or Southafrica, but I have to add that place is amazing (but plenty of jeeps) :(

I recommend this resort if you want to enjoy a calm holiday just walking around, doing spa/pool/sun, spot birds or just expecting to be lucky during the safari tour... otherwise no","Could be better","2017-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r465550888-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for staying at Chena Huts and taking your time off to review us. 

It is a pleasure to hear that you enjoyed the game drive at Yala National Park. We pride ourselves in having a great team working with us and it is indeed a pleasure to know that you have experienced the excellent service our staff extends.  

The fine culinary skills we offer is usually highly appreciated by our guests but I regret to hear that you did not share a similar sentiment.

Our All-inclusive rate you’ve enjoyed includes our luxury cabin with private plunge pool, all meals and beverages throughout the day, morning and evening game drives to the Yala National park which includes entry tickets, refreshments and transfers, free laundry services and complementary mini bar replenished daily. With the customized service we offer I can assure you that the rate is well within the acceptable standard. The pinot noir which was offered during your stay is definitely not local wine. It is of South African origin and is a signature Pinotage. 

Safety and well-being of our guests is of utmost importance. As we border the buffer zone of the national park you will frequently see elephants and wild-boar visiting the beach hence we  encourage all our guests to be accompanied by one of our experienced rangers when you take a stroll at the beach or do a bush walk.

Although the thatch roofing and the decking was not to your liking we would like to keep you informed that our hotel’s sustainable design has been recognized and certified Gold by LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). 

I would like to thank you once again for your feedback and I do hope you will find an opportunity to stay with us again.

The safari experience was amazing and the ranger we had was very talented and we were able to see leopards, elephants and a bear. All the staff were super friendly.

However our $US1,200 per night all inclusive accommodation and food/drinks package at Chena Huts was disappointing. They offered one red wine which was a local Sri Lankan pinot noir, and one gin which was a local Sri Lankan gin. For $US1,200 per night we expected to have a choice and to definitely not just be offered local wine and spirits.

The food was average and not 'fine dining' at all like described on the website.

The website also made out like you would be enjoying the outdoors and the beach however we were told on arrival that we were not to walk or swim at the beach and were to remain in the dining room, pool or in our hut at all times. When we did sit on the verandah out the back of our huts, we were so accosted by bugs that we had to move back inside after a few minutes. This meant that outside of safaris, we were sitting inside our hut which was not what we had imagined when we saw the website.

The huts were also not what we expected. They were nice however were all artificial - the palm leaf roof was made out of fake plastic palm leaves, the timber decking was made our of fake plastic timber. It was strange.","No beach access, very limited wine and spirits list, average food.","2017-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r454254942-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you for staying at Chena Huts and taking your time off to review. We are very pleased to hear that you were happy with the overall ambiance, setup of the cabins and on the hospitality extended by our staff. However we regret to hear that you were not entirely satisfied with your stay. 
The ocean facing rooms were under routine maintenance during the time hence the reason why we had not allocated same. 

We make every effort to have the rooms cleaned while the guests are away, however in this instance seems that the timing was not perfect as they had taken an additional 5 minutes. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. 

Safety and well-being of our guests is of utmost importance. As we border the buffer zone of the national park you will frequently see elephants and wild-boar visiting the beach. It is a rule set by the national park authorities that no guests of safari camps are permitted to walk alone in these areas as a safety measure.  Due to this reason we always request our guests to be accompanied by one of our rangers during a stroll at beach. If you had found other hotels not following these policies, it only appears that that they are violating the rules set by the National park authorities. Further it is a regulation of the national park that no person can carry fire arms as same is prohibited in this area.

Our rangers have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge on animal behaviour and psychology, further have experience working in various safari and wild life parks all over the country. Hence the reasons why many of our guests have had wonderful experiences with our rangers and have gone to great lengths to review them.  We get good sightings in all our game drives and the vehicles are always positioned to give the best view for our guests.

We take our guests experience at all our resorts very seriously and we thank you once again for the taking the time to provide your feedback. 

We do hope that you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

Thank you!

I hesitate to write this review & I do not want to be mean, but I just think other travelers need to be warned before they spend this kind of money. 

Room/Resort: This was a huge positive! This was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms we've stayed in. Extremely comfortable bed, beautiful furnishings, well laid out. Our backyard was a bit of a disappointment compared to the pictures (and other rooms). It was very large but full of crab grass (rather than full decking) and open. Considering there were only 1-2 other rooms booked during our 2-night stay, I'm not sure why they didn't put us in an ocean facing room with the nice decks, but oh well. We were told that we could not go to the beach without an escort because it was dangerous with animals. This made it so that you were really confined to your room outside of game drives & we got a little stir crazy. I went on an beach walk with a ranger once and wasn't quite sure why I could walk on my own - there were several people from Cinnamon Yala on their own, the ranger wasn't carrying a weapon to protect us & he didn't exactly instill confidence. I think the resort should reconsider this policy and maybe advise guests what to do if they did encounter an animal (especially since that it's possible for them to be near the rooms if they're at the beach).

Safari/Guides: The positive: We saw leopards, sloth bear, 1 elephant, lots of crocodiles, a crocodile kill a bird, lots of pretty birds & other small animals.  I know it is unfair to compare to South Africa safaris (except that they are charging SA prices!), and I know that Chena Huts can't control what others do/don't do in the national park, so I will refrain from judging them on this. We had 2 different safari rangers on the 3 game drives & 1 beach walk we went on. Our first ranger had 8 months experience and our 2nd had 2 weeks experience, both coming to Chena Huts after doing elephant research.  While they were both nice, it was obvious they had no experience or training in being a guide/ranger.  We had to ask our first ranger bird & animal names and he hardly spoke unless we asked questions. The 2nd ranger spoke more but was so busy taking pictures and was so excited to see the animals that he seemed to forget we were there. On several occasions we had to ask him to have the driver move the vehicle forward so we weren't blocked by a tree while he was getting perfect views/pictures of the elephant.  I actually truly appreciated his excitement to see the animals after our first guide just seemed to be along for the speedy ride, but it would have been great if he could have spoken more about the animals, their habits, predators, food sources, etc.  Although he was making kissing noises at the animals to make them turn towards his camera, so maybe he didn't know much about the animals? The guides were nice but just seemed so uncomfortable talking to us. Another couple that was on our drive felt the same way and called out our driver a few times for taking pictures and not talking to us. 

Food - The food in general was just ok and far from expectations of such an expensive place. The first day the chef came out to greet us and said just let him know if we'd like anything special or off menu - he could make us anything. At lunch, my husband requested a chicken sandwich and they said they didn't have bread. He then asked for a wrap (there was a veggie wrap on the menu), so they made a chicken wrap but left the bones in it. I had the veggie wrap and it was very greasy and not so great. Our first night the staff excitedly informed us that they had a special Beach BBQ planned for us (and the only 2 other rooms booked that night). They had cooked a ton of meat and fish on the grill but hadn't thought to ask what anyone wanted, allergies or food preferences. Every other remote/all-inclusive place we've ever stayed has asked for this information in advance - especially when they are cooking for only 6 people - to not waste food & options are limited.  When I turned down the seafood, they became very concerned and asked if I didn't eat fish. I said no & they said they were so sorry. When the meat came around, I took some chicken just to have something on my plate. Several staff came over to express their concern and the chef offered to cook me some pasta. I declined because I wasn't that hungry and they were so upset that I just wanted to tell them everything was ok so they would feel better and stop asking - which in hind sight is stupid because now I'm complaining. This whole situation could have been avoided if they just asked guests before or on arrival.  My husband who does eat meat/seafood said the BBQ wasn't very good.  We didn't eat the 2nd night because my husband was sick, so I can't say if their actual dinner menu was veggie friendly or good. 

Staff/Coordination: As I've mentioned, the staff was very friendly and wanted us to enjoy our stay but they just weren't trained. Since there were only 1-2 other rooms during our stay, we were often the only ones in the dining room/""lobby"".  They would all come up and ask how everything was but it was just a little too much because they didn't have anyone else to wait on. Also, there was no coordination among the staff. We went on our morning game drive (we were the only ones that went that day), ate breakfast and headed back to our room to find 4 people cleaning our room (and sitting on our bed) so we had to wait. If they were fully booked, I would let it pass. But they only had to clean 2 rooms that day and had 4-5 hours to do it while we were on a hotel arranged safari and breakfast. There were a few other examples of lack of coordination as well but you get the point. The staff was concerned when they learned my husband was sick and asked if they could bring food to the room since we didn't want to go to dinner - we declined but the offer was thoughtful. The next day several staff members asked if he was better, which was nice. They could have asked if he needed a doctor, medicine or help in any other way but didn't - and he was fine, just what you would expect of a luxury hotel. To summarize, it's a lot of asking if everything is ok but lacking the tools to fix it, so you just tell them it's ok so they'll stop asking. 

We did appreciate the warm welcome and goodbye from the staff and manager and that they truly want to be a good resort. They just aren't there & I hope this review can help them. I think this would be more accurately priced under $400/night and would still need to make improvements. We stayed at a range of hotels during our 11 nights in Sri Lanka +4 nights at Coco Island Maldives, with Chena Huts being the most expensive in Sri Lanka. Chena Huts was the only disappointing stay out of the 6 places we stayed.","Disappointing","2016-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r413313555-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The setting is beautiful and the small public room and the bedrooms are all very pretty.  We have stayed in the top hotels all over the world so I write this review from a point of comparative reference.  We picked this hotel personally despite the opinion of our travel agent.

The service was poor.  The management failed to coordinate any of the events that are promised as activities of the hotel.  Cooking class was scheduled and then “canceled” without any communication by the manager.  The nature keep ride let 45 minutes past its scheduled time again without any apology or notice.  The bartender was not available during cocktail time; he was on a break on it took 30 minutes to get a drink.  There was no one to greet us upon our arrival and we carried our bags to our driver ourselves as we departed. Incorrect information was given us on the day of departure about whether or not the train was running.  The manager allowed children to simply bang on the piano for much of our first day stay during our time in the public space until we asked him to address the issue.

The management was quite verbal about how great they were but we failed to see any of the performance that they so  proclaimed.

This is a shame because the property has so much to offer.  

As the reader you might wander why then, the property has gotten so many positive reviews.  I think our experience was similar to the few poor reviews.  I am not sure why there are so many good ones.

I would definitely look for an alternative property in the Kandy area.","Potential but disappointing","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r835400730-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

I don’t blame the staff at all, it’s the management that should know better. When I’ve complained they said they ran out of their “Guatemalan Beans”. If I’m the manager/owner of such a high end place, I’d personally drive from Colombo with at least a pack of local Hansa coffee. 

I do not expect this from a regular lodge, however when you charge this much and market it as a high end boutique, we go there with certain set of expectations.

Thank you for taking the time to post your feedback and we value your sentiments very much.  We are happy to note that you enjoyed the hotel grounds and the scenic views surrounding the property as well our infinity pool.  However we regret that your weren’t able to fully enjoy your stay with us and your feedback has been taken up with the team for corrective measures.

As for the road that leads to the hotel although this road is a public road which falls under the purview of local council, as a socially responsible resort we take ownership to improve the road condition every year by adding sand to level it providing our guests a peaceful arrival and departure. 

However, this is a task which can only be done at the end of the rainy period. We would like to inform that we have added gravel and levelled the road during the past week and although the road is not in perfect condition, this allows a much smoother arrival and departure to our resort.

Thank you once again and we do hope that you find an opportunity in the near future to stay with us again. 

Regards,
Ramli Ghaffoor

It's US$700 a night for DB&B, and the comments below reflect the expectations for a hotel in that price bracket.

Starting with the good points:
1. The grounds are beautiful.  The gardens are well maintained, filled with lovely plants and wildlife.  Most of the grounds are paddy fields with rice growing, along with woodlands.  It is all very beautiful.
2.  The swimming pool is stunning, large, barely used, and very clean.
3.  The rooms are large, well equipped, and with a very comfortable bed.

The not so good points:
1.  Access from the main road is down a 2km dirt track, much of which is heavily rutted.  It is 15 minutes of very slow progress.  I don't understand why the hotel, whose residents must provide much of the traffic, don't do something about it.
2.  The lighting in the rooms is abysmal.  It is all very well being green, but lighting should actually be sufficient to see properly.  Black lampshades don't help.
3.  To compound matters, the lights are controlled by a bedside 'computer', which is most unintuitive.  And why do lights in the lounge have to be controlled from the bedside?  The designer could not have found a more effective method for annoying guests.
4.  The air conditioning is too noisy to be used at night.  This is unacceptable when night time temperatures are a minimum of 25C and you can't have windows open because of the risk of animals and bugs.
5.  Service in the restaurant is variable at best.  You will struggle to get through breakfast in 45 minutes even when you have said you are in a hurry.  There are plenty of staff but little action.  My pancakes the first day were stone cold, and the coffee undrinkable.

With the exception of the group's head chef who happened to be on site whilst we were there, and came to speak with us after our complaint about the cold breakfast, we cannot think of a single member of staff who seemed genuinely interested in ensuring our stay was comfortable.  The gardeners seemed the most genuine.

With a bit more attention to detail, and a significant upgrade to staff training, this could be a fantastic hotel, well worth the very high price being charged.  Sadly right now, you just feel you are a revenue stream for the owners.","This place could be so good","2016-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2335977-d1876504-r343525107-Uga_Ulagalla-Thirappane_North_Central_Province.html",

It is very unfortunate to hear that our staff were not able to satisfy you entirely on this instance. our staff including the GM himself, I believe had inquired about the overall experience from you many times during your stay to which you had responded with positive sentiments and hence they are deeply saddened to see this review as they would have appreciated the feedback while you were at the resort.  We are in fact quite surprised to see this review as our staff has been receiving very good  reviews from our guests on their service and caring attitude. 

We are extremely proud of our warm & courteous associates who have been the primary reason for our success. Something that has been overwhelmingly acknowledged by our valued guests. Although our staff across the resort served  you and your family warmly and graciously, we regret we were not able to satisfy you entirely  on this occasion .

We have tried and contact you personally to which we have obtained no response.  Once again we regret any inconvenience caused to you during you stay.

Guest feedback and suggestions are definitely welcomed in our industry and we will continue to place priority on staff training and development so that our staff are able to consistently deliver the services to the satisfaction of all our guests.

The environment is beautiful and so calm - during the day you get the impression you're the only guest in the hotel.

The food is stunning - particularly if you like the traditional 'rice & curry', which is cooked and presented in such a wonderful way. There are many other dishes to try, all of which are superb.
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. It was a perfect start to my holiday, and I really think those 'tourists' who gave negative reviews of this establishment should never have come to Sri Lanka in the first place....

BUT....be aware that they take a credit card deposit of 10,000 rupees on checking in, and that is NOT deducted from your final bill.

When arriving at the site, we first had to negotiate for about 15 minutes outside of the security gate to be allowed to enter. Once in, it quickly showed out that Ulagalla resorts claimed that they did not have a reservation for us.
After several phone calls with Hotels.com customer service - who behaved professionally - nothing much changed more than that the seniority of the person meeting us became higher and higher. We interfaced with the general manager and eventually with his manager.
No action was taken other than explaining to us - again and again - that we did not have a reservation and that the fault must have been on Hotels.com's side. We spent more than 2 hours waiting, not coming any further.
Eventually, the general manager told us that he could transfer us to another hotel 45 minutes away and that we could return for our last three nights. He, however, claimed that we should pay for these night even though we had done that payment already 5 months earlier. Realising that we would now end up paying twice, having a yet bigger exposure to risk, we told the general manager that unless he was capable of ensuring (by speaking to Hotels.com) that we did not have to pay twice, we could not stay.
He - the general manager (!) - then behaved irrationally and emotionally explaining to us that he did not anyhow think we would be the ""right people for his place"". It was an insult up our face. He said that to a deeply tired family with three kids, having travelled 4 hours to get to his hotel and having had to wait two hours without being provided with any food.
When we wanted to leave, the general manager's manager excused himself, but not more than that he did not pay the transportation out of his hotel. On the contrary, he told us the price and asked us to pay.
Conclusion: The true nature of this place - looking great on surface - showed when the management came under pressure.

When we mentioned this to the butler, he said ""We don't even understand what they are singing about.""  and quickly walked away.   We asked other staff and learnt that there're four festivals in a year at the nearby Hindu temple.  We travelled around 12 hours from Sydney to Colombo plus 4 hrs in transit and another 4.5 hrs to Norwood.  We didn't expect to be bombarded with this loud, non-stop Bollywood music day and night in the middle of tea plantation on our vacation. We thought it would be switched off at night.  When we got up 2 am, the music was still on in the same volume.  We did see they moved people to the other bungalow who asked discount for the disturbance.  We were left there to ""enjoy"" the music.  We had to chase the head office on this matter and finally got partial refund for the disturbance.

On arrival, we inquired about the tea factory tour.  The butler said ""There is a festival going on.  I have to call and check if the tour is still on.""  He never got back to us.  We thought he had arranged it for us.  No.  He presumed that we were not interested because my husband mentioned he knew the process. 

He said twice that he would leave the registration form on our desk.  But that form had never appeared on our desk.

At dinner, the butler came to us for the next day's activity.  I asked ""Is it possible to walk to the other bungalow?""  He replied ""8, 12, 16km, which one do you want to go?""  It's a bit daunting for 12 and 16km, so I chose the 8km one. He said ""I will give you a map.""  He walked away immediately.

The following morning after breakfast, we realized he didn't even book the tea factory tour for us.  We asked him if we can go to the nearby tea factory.  ""Oh, yes, tell them you are guests from the bungalow, so you can look around the factory.""  We did go there as he told us.  No, the factory is not open to the public.

It seemed to us that there's only this butler in charge at the bungalow.  I was not happy, so I sent an email to their head office to complain.  

During lunch, an assistant manager suddenly appeared and quickly arranged a private tea factory tour for us.  After my complaint, the butler confirmed with us that we would be chauffeured to the other bungalow back and forth.  We were being gradually upgraded from being given a map to walk there at dinner, to one way car offered after breakfast,  then to round-trip car confirmed at lunch.

In our less than 24 hr and 4 brief encounters with this particular butler, it didn't take long to prove he was unable to fulfill his words and gave us very misleading information. When we were ferried to Dunkeld later on and saw the road condition with all the ups and downs and twists and turns and traffic condition, we felt it's more like a 16km walk rather than a flat 8 km walk. What was he thinking?  

The one star we rated is based on the noise and the butler.
We will give the rest of the staff five stars.

Our suggestions:
For top end accommodation:  Go to Amanwella and Amangalla, no one behaves like this butler.  We were treated as equal just like all other guests.  Their general managers are very accessible.

For scenery, Ella rock looks spectacular.  Norwood is not that great.  

For ""walkable walk"", take the car up to Lipton seat and walk down to Dambatenne tea factory.  It is picturesque with stone walls, tea plantation dotted with boulders, unspoiled mountains, and few traffic.","Marred by the noise and an unpleasant butler","2016-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r373987228-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

Our biggest disappointment by far, however, was Norwood Cottage of Ceylon Tea Trails; surprising, really, as this was also by far the most expensive property we stayed at. Our immediate impression on entering the grounds and then the house is that it is tired and dated, and in need of refurbishment and attention to detail. Stained upholstery, worn rugs, mismatching and dated furniture and fittings, untrimmed lawns and hedges, and uncleaned outdoor furniture is not what we expected in a property of this calibre. The bedroom lacked ambience and character, particularly at night with bright lighting. One of the redeeming features of the bungalow is the large dining and living room, with its vaulted timber ceiling, large stone fireplace, and walls of glass and french doors opening onto the alfresco patio, where breakfast and lunches are served overlooking the gardens, valley and mountains. The picturesque setting is the other redeeming feature. Meals were on the whole disappointing and not what we had expected in a Relaix & Chateaux establishment - the 4 course dinner advertised on the website turned out to be a fairly ordinary Sri Lankan curry followed by dessert, which equates to 2 courses to our thinking. The final letdown was that we were not served tea in bed in the morning, as promised on the website, although we did hear the ""butlers"" knocking on some of the other guests' doors, so presumably some of them did get tea in bed. In the morning I wanted to read my book out in our courtyard, however our table and chairs were wet from rain the previous evening, and covered in leaves, so I abandoned this idea.  I then moved to the pool area with the same idea in mind, only to find that these too were wet; I would have expected that in an establishment of this calibre the outdoor furniture would be cleaned and wiped down regularly for guests to use at any time. We left Norwood feeling disappointed and somewhat angry - it did not come remotely close to meeting our expectations, and we would not recommend this place to anyone!

Our two-day stay at Norwood was in stark contrast to the sublime luxury offered 
by the sister  property Castlereagh (see below). Our room (Jeffry) was a disgrace for a property of this status. It was small, user-unfriendly and with a bathroom little more than a narrow corridor (one had to take it in turn to use it). If this was not enough, the room and bathroom were severely overlooked from the new restaurant and potentially from waiting staff and other guests, who had to walk past the window. When we arrived there was not even a net curtain in situ! The room's proximity to the restuarant, meant that from 05.20 each morning sleep was wishful thinking. The final straw came when we realised there was neither AC or a ceiling fan and that the floor fan was worn out and so noisy it was quite impossible to use. Although we asked for a replacement, we were informed it was not possible. We left tired and disgruntled after 2 sleepless nights and spending a lot of money.. If you choose to stay here, do not book a room without knowing its location - there are two like ours.
CASTLEREAGH ***** 
Brilliant ambiance, excellent service and food. Our two-day stay in a suite in Castlereagh Bungalow more than met our expectations of the luxury and attentive service of a fine Relais et 
Chateau property. The bungalow was well managed and the cuisine excellent. The lakeside location (from where there are some interesting walks), provides a tranquil, yet scenic location. Thoroughly recommended.

Now the disappointing part;What we didn't appreciate was that we will be staying in what we recognized to be a British 60's style bungalow that was now somewhat tired and ready for a significant makeover.We were reluctant to use a bathtub/shower with a curtain that at least to us smelled of mildew,grout that confirmed mold and similarly afflicted caulking.In our bedroom their were stains on the ceiling complemented by cobwebs and dust on the windows and poorly painted woodwork.We may simply have been unlucky.When it comes to meals however,we felt truly mislead by the impression given that a chef was on hand to prepare high quality meals to please every guest.In fact,given the remote location of the property and the small number of rooms ,it is clear to us now that,when offered,such variety came at the expense of freshness.Based on our experience we would recommend sticking to Sri Lankan food which was wasn't always on offer but was very good.
We discussed our concerns with management who appeared to appreciate the feedback.Hopefully refurbishment will take place(the season ends very soon) and Sri Lankan cuisine, based on fresh seasonal local ingredients ,will feature more prominently.","Stunning views,beautiful grounds,shame about the rest","2014-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r196612438-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

This place could be fantastic, and shame on the owners for their short sightedness.  My wife and I had the Master Bedroom for three nights (and this was supossedly their best room).  The website photos of the interior are not reflective of the poor quality, chipped furnishings, and flea market quality decor.

My wife and I travel about a third of the year on busines and pleasure, and try to be balanced in reviews, given the standards of differing contries and cultures.  We spent three nights in the master suite at Summerville - This house had cracked tiles,  in the bathroom which desperately needed re-grouting, cheap furniture which was not ""antique"" by any measure, and the whole inside felt as if it needed a huge remodel (not to change the period feel, but rather to bring it up above the standard of a two star lodging).  The cabinets smelled of moth balls, as if the home belonged to an elderly relative who had lost their sense of smell, and cleanliness. The various brick a brack were not quaint, simply cheap, as if they were afraid the guest might walk off with anything of value.  One other couple from Hong Kong who visited concurrent with us suggested that they felt like they were visiting a ""Brady Bunch House"" (a bad american sitcom set in a home with tacky cheap furniture).  The rooms simply lacked class, which is not only expected, but demanded in this price range (I believe their prices are fair; provided they remodel the interiors with decent period furniture, new curtains and other items that do not make you cringe).

This appalling attention to the interiors and furnishings is especially shortsighted, when even as a foriegner, we could purchase top quality period peices around Galle for next to nothing (and authentic looking reproductions were even less expensive)

Here are the good and the bad:

Good:  
1. Staff.  The staff was top notch, and the cooking perfection.  The chef made not only delightful food, but an artistic display of each meal.  The fact that the chef would speak to us each day and    find out what we most wanted, and what our needs were (he made a few special soups for my wife which were wonderful! - if we could hire hime for our home, we would do so.

The other staff were very standoffish initially.  But my wife and I found that once we smiled and laughed with them a bit, they warmed up, and became delightful - I think that they feared they would make a mistake setting silverware, or pouring from the wrong side... and when they realized that this was unimportant to us, and we were more interested in learning about them and their families and life, they became their wonderful selves.  

2.  Setting. This is one of the most beautiful settings in the world - and I think most of the good reviews really come from the feel you get when you step outside and take in the beautiful lake and rows and rows of mountainous tea plants.  My wife and I hiked up the hills on our own, intentionally getting a bit lost (and made our way into a wonderful small village where we laughed with the local children and their mothers..... though we did not speak the local language, smiles were all that was needed for a kind exchange of cultures).  We had expected the Tea pickers to be treated poorly based on western articles, and that seemed far from the case, with their health and educational needs taken care of, and their huts, although small, were clean and clearly a good home (ironically most with satallite dishes- which we see more and more in the most remote places).  

Bad:  The buildilng, the cheap furniture, the smelly mothball scent and feel.  The ridiculous bookshelf which they called a library in the main room (looked like IKEA with about 3 overused board games, and no selection of books other than what you would find in a cheap youth hostel).

The Pool:  The pool is beautiful, stunning overlooking the lake, but was not heated.. so what's the point, except to take a photo?

Insects:  We have ventured into the deepest jungles of Africa and Cambodia, among others, so we expect insects of all sorts (some are amazingly beautiful and we saw a few fireflies (and we love geckos which feed of the insects).... but we also expect at least where the rooms and dining areas are to have a level of mosquito coils or other assistance so that you can sit a bit without becoming the main course.  Each of the guest kept asking for mosquito coils, but the limited number kept going out... surely this is easily solved and a constant refrain, so why not fix it?  We had brought sprays, as had the other guest, but these were obviously a hardy strain and didn't seem to be affected.....  We don't expect or want a place to be insect free, but a reduction, certainly around the eating areas is deserved.

Our recommendation is to hope they either improve, or are forced by competition to get their act together, as this beautiful area should not be missed during a Sri Lanka visit.","Perfect Setting - Smelly Unkempt Building With Tacky Furniture","2012-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r149090283-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

THE SERVICE WAS PATCHY, THE BUTLER WE HAD SEEMED VERY UNINTERESTED AND UNHELPFUL I FELT A BURDEN ASKING HIM FOR ANYTHING:

You handed the butler 30 items for laundry the day you arrived, he said he would send it to the main laundry at Norwood Bungalow and have it returned the next day. You said you needed them the same day. So we had 2 staff and the manager himself ironing your clothes and returned them as requested, when you handed over 43 more items, which we again readily accepted. I believe this indicates the level of service we offer, as consistently attested by other reviews.

The manager gave you his personal laptop to use when the desktop computer in the manager room was being used by another guest. We offer free wi-fi throughout the bungalows.

NO MENTION WAS MADE OF OUR HONEYMOON WHEN WE ARRIVED OR AT ANYTIME DURING OUR STAY

On 11th August we offered you a special 5 course alfresco candlelit dinner to celebrate your honeymoon. You said that you were tired and would like to have it the next day. Due to inclement weather, we served you the special honeymoon dinner indoors on 12th August.

WE WERE CRAMMED INTO A SMALL ROOM
You booked online for 2 adults and 2 children [not 1 child as you say above] into a twin bedded room. Room sizes and bed types are indicated when booking and the Jamieson luxury room you booked was shown as 40sqm. We alerted you by email that only one additional bed could be provided although you were bringing 2 children. We did suggest a larger Garden Suite, which you did not want to take. 

I am sorry that we have to respond in such detail but it is important that other potential guests are not misled. Tea Trails is popular amongst travelers looking for an unique experience and August is a busy month, but we do not drop our service standards when operating at full capacity.

 The service was very patchy a couple of the staff were good including Christo but others including the manager were unfriendly. The butler service is a con, the butler we had seemed very uninterested and unhelpful I felt a burden asking him for anything.
I had high expectations of Tea trails after all the postive reviews on TA and the high cost per night. We left feeling extremely disapointed with our stay.

After extensive back & forth over email and phone (while we were at a resort in the Maldives) the staff finally confirmed they had received our payment.  Upon arrival, the first thing the manager said was that our payment was still pending… huh?

The main restaurant, Il Mare, was completely booked, as was the spa — so we were unable to use either.  Perhaps if the staff had sent us a nice welcoming email with recommendations rather than a series of belittling emails the week of our stay we could have avoided these issues.

We stayed at 5 hotels during our honeymoon and this was by far the worst.  Wi-Fi at the pool doesn’t work so you can’t actually communicate with your concierge.  They have many many staff, most of whom stand around doing nothing and are not helpful.

Ayubowan from Anantara Tangalle, Sri Lanka! 
Thank you for taking the time to send us such a detailed review. I sincerely apologize that your stay with us got off to a bad start and that we failed to meet your expectations in a number of areas. This is most definitely not exemplary of a stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort. When I met you during your stay, I was of course very disappointed to hear that we were not able to meet the high standard that we have set for ourselves to make our guest’s holiday a memorable one. 

I am very sorry that you experienced a service that was below our standards especially with the privacy issue not being properly addressed and the fact that you got the impression that your constructive feedback was brushed off by some team members. Rest assured that corrective measures have been taken to this regard, we will use your feedback as a training tool and use the incidents you have highlighted to ensure we continuously improve our guest experiences. 

I have separately responded to you via the survey as well and remain available should you wish to provide further feedback directly. 

Kind Regards

We flew all the way from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia specifically to stay at this resort, drawn in by the brand's reputation and the villa's advertised features.

Unfortunately, our experience was deeply disappointing — and not what you'd expect from a resort charging ~$1,000 per night.

Misleading Ocean View: The villa was promoted as having a direct ocean view and beach access. In reality, the view was heavily blocked by tall greenery, and we could barely see the ocean from the villa or the plunge pool (Villa 606). This was not at all what the photos on the website suggested.

Lack of Privacy: There was a shared door to the neighboring villa with a visible gap. Despite being told by staff that it had been “fixed,” no one inspected it — and only after I raised the issue again was it sealed with a strip of black tape… on the second-last day of our stay.

Delayed and Dismissive Service: For the first few days, our concerns were brushed off. I had to email the resort formally before the General Manager personally intervened, listened to our concerns, and offered a compensation. We appreciated that — but by then, the experience had already been tarnished.

Villa Host Experience: Our assigned host gave a basic tour, then forwarded PDFs of everything (dining, spa, excursions) via WhatsApp and left us to figure it out. No one tailored anything to our needs or offered suggestions — even though we were traveling with a baby. As a result, we didn’t engage in any resort experiences, and it felt like a missed opportunity — both for us and for the hotel.

Room Readiness: Basic amenities like the USB charging ports weren’t working when we arrived, and had to be fixed later.

Booking Confusion: Before arrival, we received repeated emails asking for pre-payment even though our booking clearly stated no advance payment was needed. I had to share screenshots to resolve this.

This does not mean that there weren't some good things offered at the resort. What was good:

The General Manager: Once involved, he took the matter seriously, met with us directly, and offered a resolution. His professionalism was appreciated — even though the damage to the experience had already been done.

Meuru (Staff Member): In the last two days, Meuru stepped in where others didn’t. He was responsive, helpful, stayed in touch via WhatsApp, and ensured our departure was smooth. He’s a true asset to the property.

Breakfast Team: Very friendly and attentive. They were especially sweet with our baby and even made us an iced Spanish latte on request — something not on the menu.

Departure Experience: We were given a late checkout until 5 PM, and everything was handled seamlessly from the villa.

Overall, this trip had the potential to be very special — but the mismatch between expectations and reality, the delayed attention to problems, and the lack of proactive service made it a regretful experience. I hope the resort takes this feedback seriously and improves, because at these rates, guests deserve much better.","A Disappointing Stay Saved Only by the General Manager and One Standout Team Member","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1001161328-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Ayubowan from Anantara Tangalle, Sri Lanka! 
Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay at our resort in Sri Lanka. We’re disheartened to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations, especially after what sounds like an incredible journey through the country.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you faced upon arrival and the challenges with restaurant bookings. While our records show that we accommodated you for an early check-in and did our best to secure reservations, the high occupancy during your stay limited our available time slots. That being said, we always strive to provide excellent service to all our guests, and we will review our processes to enhance communication and assistance in such situations.

Regarding the beach vendors, we understand that this may have been uncomfortable. While we do not have control over public areas, we appreciate your feedback and will explore ways to create a more relaxing environment for our guests.

We also acknowledge your concerns about pricing and additional taxes. We are committed to offering our guests premium-quality food, and the pricing reflects the high standards we uphold. Additionally, the taxes applied are government-imposed, and we are required to adhere to them. However, we understand how this may have impacted your overall experience and appreciate your perspective.

On a positive note, we’re delighted that you enjoyed the breakfast buffet, and we hope there were other moments of your stay that you found enjoyable. If you would be open to it, we would love the opportunity to welcome you back to Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle in the future and provide you with an improved experience.

Sellers on the beach were very pushy and in your face… I know it’s not a private beach but the hotel encouraged them.  Even letting them lay out all the huge shells in a stall at the beach entrance. Surely selling huge shells is illegal!?

I read food and drinks at this place were over priced and they were…. And then they  added 4 taxes to the menu price!!!

The only place to get a drink most of the day is the very noisy, busy pool bar…. With no views….. the views are one of the hotels features… but you can only enjoy after 5 pm if you manage to grab one of a few tables at the Italian restaurant.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We sincerely regret that your experience did not meet expectations.
Regarding pricing, as a tax-registered company, we are required to comply with government tax regulations, which contribute to the final cost. Additionally, we use high-quality products across our services, including our spa, dining, and beverage offerings, ensuring an elevated experience for our guests.
We apologize for any miscommunication regarding restaurant reservations and the information provided upon arrival. We always recommend booking specialty dining in advance, as these venues have limited seating to maintain an intimate experience. While they may not appear full at all times, reservations ensure smooth service and dining flow.
Your concerns about service, warm drinks, and poolside assistance have been noted, and we will address these areas with our team to enhance guest experience.

 Regarding the beach vendors, while they operate in public spaces beyond our direct control, we do our best to manage interactions to ensure minimal disruption for our guests with having available our security team full time available.

When we arrived lunchtime we were told to book Japanese or Italian restarants, if we did not want to eat in the large buffet restarant on the evening. We should have been told to book staight away, as when we tried to book a couple of hours later the restaurant's were full! We had to book straight away to get reservations for our other two nights... can't understand it as neither restaurant was full, whilst we were dining?!  

Only one bar open till 5 pm. That was the very crowded pool bar, with no views. 

We were  hardly given any information about  the property. Lady who took us to our room hardly said anything. 

Be aware they add 3 or  4 taxes to your bill.... increases your bills by about 30%! Spa $180 dollars plus taxes.. husband had paid about $60 to $90 dollars in other hotels on our journey.   Two hour massage in an amazing spa in Tangalle was $60. 
The bars were empty and no atmosphere, everyone was buying their own drinks from  town and drinking in the grounds and in their rooms. We even went and bought soft drinks from town... something we have never done before. 
3 times drinks were served warm! 
Lack of  drinks service around pool, most days we had to help ourselves to towels.

The first time my wife and I used the pool we both soon realised that the pool tiles were very slippery, whether it was because the glaze was the problem and/or peoples sun tan lotion.
Either way, my wife put a foot on the steps into the pool and immediately her legs went from under her because of the slippery tiles. Fortunately she wasn't hurt but it put both of us off from using the pool again.
On top of this the pool had no hand rails by the steps into the pool,which is something I have never seen before in any of the numerous hotels we have stayed at all over the world.
I informed the hotel employee who had been looking after us that we considered the pool to be dangerous.
So a two week stay and couldn't safely use the pool.
No one from the management ever acknowledged my complaint until the day of our departure.
Then the totally unsatisfactory response was ""we appreciate your feedback"" 
Oh really? That's it?
Another big disappointment was the Teppanyaki restaurant.
A dramatically over priced mish mash of food at London prices!
I wouldn't have minded the price if the food had been ok. It wasn't!

The rooms are very outdated and housecleaning does not pay attention to the fine details. We have had to tell the housecleaning department 3 times to spray balcony for all the ants every day so that we can enjoy the balcony day bed. Also the coffee and tea area had small tiny red ants as well so don't leave anything out. Conditioner runs out. Rooms aren't swept all the time so there's always sand around.
Breakfast is a big disappointment. I love they have a juice bar but the juice isn't strained so you are drinking pulp or pieces of shredded carrot. I think investing in a juicer like Breville would be great. The pancake and waffle batter are the same.
Lunch by the pool is extremely expensive and very poor quality. The only thing I liked was the garlic king prawns but after having it three times, I was done. Samosa's were extremely thick and very greasy. Calamari was very rubbery. Pasta was good. Drinks are really warm. We asked for Bloody Marry's with Ice and luckily I was able to ask the bartender to repeat my order and he understood, lot's of spice... ask for beer in an ice bucket. The food and drinks are very overpriced!!! The ice lollie's at 11:45AM was a big hit.
The Italian restaurant was horrible. We couldn't see our food even when they gave use a plastic cube with light. We were supposed to have a romantic dinner the following day but for $600 for no view of the ocean from the cliff and over cooked seafood and warm wine we immediately cancelled. Everything we ordered even the homemade chocolate they gave us was so sad.
We ate dinner on the last day at the dinning room. Kids were touching the squid tentacles. We hardly ate $50 worth of dinner that night.
We loved the surf opportunities the kids had with the contractor they had. The beach they take you to is amazing. We had more fun there then swimming in the hot pool. It was only 15 min away by tuck-tuk. Several kids would move the pool chairs that were in the water around so they could jump on them. About 8-10 year olds sat in the pool and used the small ledge to eat their bowls of ice cream all at the same time. I wish the rules were more enforced. I also had to tell the attendants to please clean up all the tissue paper around the floors. There are only set of bathrooms in the entire pool and dinning area. Sometimes it wouldn't be cleaned up.
The Asian restaurant is outside and very hot. We felt that the sushi we ordered could have been much colder. The drinks could have been much colder. there isn't much of a ventilation other than the fans above so you will smell like the grill near by.
My daughter and I did attend one session of yoga in the morning and that was lovely.
The spa was beautiful but having more options for the oils and a ginger tea after the session would have better. We couldn't drink the drink they gave us after our couples massage.
We loved our greeting and send off from the hotel. Everyone wants to help and tries to understand what you need with beautiful smiles. We did love the grounds of the hotel and the monkeys that would run around.
All that being said, I was hoping to feel rested after this trip but felt more annoyed that we spent so much money on 2 rooms at a hotel that did not resemble luxury or five stars. We will not be returning in the near future.","....only to leave disappointed","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r948107183-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is massive and feels terribly crowded. To walk from one place to the next takes you 15 minutes at least which is great to make sure people do not leave the ground. Unfortunately, the restaurants are much below average and the prices are some of the highest we have seen (and we stayed in much more luxurious places since we got here). The service in the restaurants is good but the service has of the hotel is generally well below what we have seen so far. No one to help you find a lounge chair or order a drink.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts following your recent stay at our Resort. We sincerely appreciate your feedback, especially your keen observations regarding our architectural design and environmental considerations.

Firstly, we want to clarify that we do not have orange umbrellas on our premises. Your mention of such elements highlights the importance of maintaining consistency in our design choices to ensure they complement the natural beauty of our surroundings.

While we regret any discomfort you may have experienced during your stay, it's important to note that each guest's perception of the atmosphere can vary. We take pride in our efforts to provide a welcoming environment for all our guests, as evidenced by the numerous positive reviews we receive regarding the ambiance and hospitality of our establishment.

Regarding your observations about the demographic makeup of our guests, we strive to accommodate travelers from diverse backgrounds, fostering an inclusive atmosphere for all. While certain regions may attract specific demographics, we remain committed to offering enriching experiences for every guest, regardless of nationality or cultural background.

We appreciate your suggestion to explore other coastal bases such as Galle or Yala area for future visits. These regions indeed offer unique opportunities to immerse oneself in the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of Sri Lanka.

Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback. Your insights help us continuously improve and enhance the experience we provide to our guests. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and exceed your expectations.

Nice reception areas and restaurant design, marred by some garish orange umbrellas and loungers and some cost-cutting architecture on the room buildings, which were ugly and blocky. 

The vibe was overtly weird. There was a lot of sunbed blocking on the beach and by the pool and an unfriendly atmosphere in common areas and the buffet restaurant (note: the staff were welcoming and polite). I would not speculate as to why. Maybe everyone else was just sullen about the orange sun loungers?

South coast in general is getting built up fast but there are still some quiet areas.
Re demographics, the Anantara and the resort hotels of the South coast is majority Russian tourists these days. Not many other Europeans, North Americans etc. Other areas of Sri Lanka (cultural triangle, Galle, Yala, Ella, tea plantations) have more of a mix of tourists from all over the world. 

I would use Galle or Yala area as a coastal base next time. And visit the north, which I wasn’t able to fit in on this trip.","Weird vibe","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r942985636-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Ayubowan from Anantara Tangalle, Sri Lanka! 
We appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with us and sincerely apologize for any inconveniences you encountered during your stay at our Resort in Sri Lanka. 
First and foremost, we deeply regret the incident that occurred in the washroom. We understand the distress it caused, and we want to assure you that our team took immediate action to address the situation. Our Assistant Front Office Manager, Villa Manager, and Chief Concierge personally attended to you, offering a heartfelt apology, and providing necessary first aid. We regret any discomfort caused and genuinely hope that your recovery has been smooth.
In response to the unfortunate incident, we proposed additional assistance, including a visit to our resort's Ayurvedic Physician and a complimentary spa treatment. We understand that your schedule did not permit these options, but we genuinely wanted to ensure your well-being and comfort during your stay.
Regarding the whale-watching excursion, we regret that the experience did not meet your expectations. Wildlife activities, such as whale watching, inherently come with the unpredictability of animal sightings, as they roam freely in their natural habitat. While we do communicate this to our guests upfront, we understand your disappointment.
We offered a complimentary transport for the excursion, as well as an alternative complimentary whale-watching experience on the following day, complete with transportation and entry tickets to a shared boat. We acknowledge your preference for a private boat, but unfortunately, last-minute arrangements for a private excursion proved challenging. We hope you understand that this was beyond our control.
Furthermore, we extended a fully complimentary transportation service for your Galle City Tour, demonstrating our commitment to making amends for any dissatisfaction.
We understand your perspective and acknowledge your feelings, but we want to reiterate that our team made sincere efforts to address your concerns promptly and comprehensively. We value your feedback and are committed to continuously improving our services.

It's important to note that your feedback is unique and does not align with the typical reviews we receive, both on social media and TripAdvisor. We take pride in the positive responses we usually receive about our excursions and safaris, highlighting the quality of service and memorable experiences provided to our guests.

We sincerely hope that the remainder of your stay is more enjoyable, and we look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back to Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle in Sri Lanka, providing you with the exceptional experience that our guests deserve.

Kind regards,
Roberto Simone- General Manager

When we arrived I went into the women’s loos but the sensor for the lights didn’t work and the door closed behind me leaving the room in darkness. When I turned to leave I walked into a low ottoman in the centre of the room and cut my shins open on the sharp wood edge. Nobody at first acknowledged that what had happened was the hotel’s fault and instead stuck to their welcome script so I had the strange experience of sitting with bleeding legs being bandaged up while various people were talking us through the facilities and telling us what a wonderful time was in store for us. Only after speaking to our (very good) kuoni rep was I visited by a manager who did apologise and offered transport for one of our trips, which was much appreciated. 

Having bounced back from an embarrassingly tearful arrival we then went out super early the next day on a private speedboat whale watching trip. I paid around £500 for this for my partner’s birthday. I had prebooked this over email and wasn’t told at any point that we might not see any whales. I know on a safari you don’t choose what animals you see - but this trip was presented as a sure thing. And all the reviews on here seem to agree. But we saw no whales. I had hoped for a part refund of the fee given that the trip was misleadingly labelled, but only a refund of the transport costs has been offered. I guess I don’t legally have any rights here as I didn’t ask for a guarantee. I just trusted the marketing and now I feel very silly. So please be careful if you are planning to spend a lot to see whales! 

In summary, the resort itself is very nice, well landscaped, nice rooms, pretty beach and there are some lovely staff but I’ve spent most of my time here feeling unhappy/making complaints - with the result that it now feels uncomfortable being here. For the first time in my life I’m looking forward to leaving a holiday and going back to England.","Be wary of the whale watching trip","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r940987992-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

We appreciate your feedback, moreover, disappointed that your experience with us was in the manner you have described. 

First of all, we would like to apologize for not meeting your expectations. Please know we value our guest’s feedback and your comments have been shared with our team so we may continuously improve the guest experience.

On arrival, we have assigned you the best Deluxe view room available. Due to the limited number of Deluxe Ocean View rooms on the property, we were unable to move you to a different Deluxe Ocean View room due to high occupancy.
We take upkeep and cleanliness very seriously at our hotel, and your room should always feel fresh and clean. Our staff generally does an excellent job of maintaining our facility and preparing the rooms for incoming guests, so it is surprising that this occurred.
Additionally, we communicated the challenges at the pool area to the food and beverage manager. Rest assured that this will be immediately rectified.

Regarding your comment about our prices, do allow me to point out that our pricing is comparable to similar properties in the area and we feel we provide good value given our location and extensive facilities. So, we would like to express our thanks in advance for your kind understanding in this matter.

Our front office staff had informed you that due to the back-to-back situation, the late check out was not possible. That room was reserved by another guest on the day you checked out, and they requested a check-in time of 1pm. Please accept my apologies if this was not properly communicated to you.

We have over 350 employees working on the property to ensure that all of our guests needs are met. Furthermore, we place a high value on our employees and ensure they are looked after since we believe that if the employees are happy, the guests will benefit from that happiness. Further, Economic benefits to our employees are among the highest in Sri Lanka, driven by our business volume.

We will continue to learn from feedback such as yours, improve, train and stride to make the resort worthy of the hard work and dedication put each and every day by the team.

We would love the opportunity to exceed your expectations and would like to invite you back to the resort very soon.

We extend our heartfelt apologies for not achieving our goal of providing you with a top-notch stay, but we appreciate you staying with us on this visit, and we sincerely hope that you will give us another chance to restore your faith in our hotel and hospitality.

Stay safe!

Why fully occupy a hotel if you do not have the manpower to deliver what customers pay for?

I stayed here for 4 nights with my 4-year old daughter. We stayed at great properties in Sri Lanka in the days before and were looking forward to the relaxing days on the beach. But arriving at this hotel already irritated me. We were greeted by dramatic drums and blowing of a seashell, which I am sure might be appreciated by certain people but for me felt like going to the theatre. 

Room: 
I booked a Deluxe Ocean View Room, which was spacious but, unfortunately had no view of the ocean. My request for changing the room was denied since the hotel was allegedly almost completely full (I saw free rooms…). The room itself was not clean: my daughters socks were black after a few hours in the room and everything we touched was sticky or stained. The cleaning-crew worked very hard after my complaints, but I am sure their time was missing on other ends. Windows did not seem to be cleaned regularly. Nets against mosquitoes or repellent were not provided, the minibar did not get restocked once but is very loud. You can hear everything from the adjoining rooms, especially the heavy chairs being moved on the tiles of the floor.

Pool:
The water at the pool looked old and drinks and food which were ordered during the day were not cleaned. It looked really, really messy. They also tolerate the game of guests blocking sunloungers with towels. On the beach there are remains of what once must have been romantic beddings. They now can not be used anymore, look terrible and are a hazard for injuries. Theoretically there are life guards at the pool and the ocean (waves and tides are rather rough) but they also have to distribute and collect towels and drinking water at the same time, so there is zero time for them to actually „life-guard“. There are no places to change a swimsuit and restrooms are only found at the restaurant. Also no wifi on the beach.

Activities:
They are all absolutely and ridiculously overpriced and the communication around them took hours of my holiday. Again: this is not the fault of the people actually realizing the activities, but the chain of command in communication was not working. In this context I think it was rather annoying to receive daily messages by Anantara before arrival to ”enhance“ once stay. Also no communication before booking these activities about how these add-ons are modified due to Covid.
Also there are Tuktuks on the property which drive dangerously fast. It is an accident waiting to happen and not safe for children to run around freely.
My request for a late checkout took 4 days to be processed (only higher ranking staff apparently can take decisions, but I guess there are a lot of them piling up….), on day 4 I gave up since our driver needed the pickup-time to arrange the next transfer.

All in all I paid around 400 dollars/night in a supposedly 5 star hotel, which was definitely not worth the money. I felt tricked, treated like a cash cow and can not recommend staying here and will most definitely not return! I hope that the truly wonderful staff will start working at other hotels, where their commitment is truly appreciated and valued by their management.","Management failure…","2022-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r830048399-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

In regard to the pricing of the room/villa all our quoted rates are standard (Seasonal wise), however the lack of cleanliness and quality of the product and service were highly affected due to the pandemic situation and we take full responsibility for the downfall. It was a difficult period for us as well as the country to keep up with brand standards. however I will be passing on your valued comments on to the management for a close examination.

First, let’s start with the positive! The staff are very friendly and want the guests to be happy. Our favorite restaurant Verala was fantastic! The bar at Verla is excellent as well! Unfortunately, the Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort must be short-staffed as the staff cannot provide the appropriate customer service required at a $1,000/night room rate. Read on to learn more……

For the negative, this resort is way too expensive for the room we were given. Our room was $1,000 per night, and I would say that it is worth $350 maximum. When we first arrived around 10:00 pm, we were given a bottom-floor room without a view. I asked to be moved, and about an hour later, we relocated to a top-floor room. The view from the room was lovely, but that was the only thing nice about this $1,000 a night room. Anantara had a 5-night minimum, so we were stuck with this rate for five nights. The room was very basic and similar to a standard Marriott or Hyatt at about $175 per night in the US. The furniture in the room was old, and the room itself was dirty with stains on the walls and floors. The bathroom was marginal at best. The only reason why I am complaining is due to the exorbitant price. I do not recommend anyone staying at Anatara in a premium room for $1,000/night.

We received a buffet breakfast for our $1,000/night with a 5-night minimum. The staff was lovely, but the food was marginal at best. In addition, the glass doors are filthy! There is food and oil all over the door handles and windows. 

The pool, beach area, and gym are perfectly fine but once again not worth $1,000 per night. 

We waited 2.5 hours to have our COVID tests on our last day. Once again, not up to the level of service for a room at $1,000/night with a 5-night minimum.

On our last night, we were told that we could not obtain a reservation at our favorite restaurant Verala as it was completely booked from outside the hotel reservations. Wait, what?!? I am paying $1,000 a night for five nights, and I can’t make a reservation at the hotel restaurant. Then I was told that I could come, but I had to preorder before the restaurant opened?!? Anyway, after throwing a fit, we were offered a table. That was fun, arguing on the last night of our vacation. 

The spa and the massages were definitely worth the price! The spa and the treatments were amazing! 

Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with friendly and kind people. However, it makes me sad that Anantara is overcharging its clients by such a ridiculous amount as I cannot recommend this property to anyone, and I will not return or experience any other Anantara resorts.

I am an avid traveler and relatively easy to please. I have no problem spending money while traveling, but I am not happy being ripped off and overcharged. Anantara, you should read some of my other reviews to learn customer service and proper pricing! You should be ashamed of yourself!","Excellent staff, extremely overpriced room, not at all worth the price, lovely spa but overall a rip off!!","2021-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r823692778-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Very nice rooms with comfortable beds and pillows but with the way the hotel is built, all the rooms face the garden and do not have any ocean view.

But the positivity ends there. The buffet spread is average with very limited variety. But what really stuck out was the staff &the hospitality. The majority of the staff is inexperienced & ill-trained. Specially the girl at the reception really needs more training on how to welcome guests as she works with the attitude of a government worker. When we arrived and i tried to check-in she dismissively signaled with her hand for me to wait and continued with her call. I waited for more than 15 minutes for her to call me back and since she didn't i went back to the reception. Again she told me to wait in a dismissive manner. It felt like being inside a government office trying to get something done from a government officer 🙄
After waiting for more than 30 minutes she finally decided to attend to checking me in (after i reminded her for the 3rd time) but messed it up and charged me more which got sorted only after the front office manager got involved. Till the manager got involved she and the other man at the reception kept arguing with me and trying to prove that the overcharged price was right with various illogical reasons (despite me showing them the email from the hotel mentioning the correct total)

I would not have written this review had I not seen a video of the same girl giving an extravagant welcome to a local youtube influencer couple, when we did not even receive a bare minimum welcome let alone pleasant. Please treat all your guests the same way and not just the youtube influencers. We actually PAY YOU unlike the youtube influencers whom you bow down to.

Even though the rooms are nice and wide the floor is full of sand. The pool has oil and grass on the top due to lawn mowing. Animals are using the pool for bathing and ravens steal the food from people's plates in the restaurant. The musicians who play here at night are unique.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at Uga Bay. We are truly sorry to hear about your experience.

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the situation you encountered. We take such matters extremely seriously, and upon learning of your complaint, we immediately launched a thorough investigation involving our security team and relevant personnel. This included a detailed review of access logs, staff interviews, and a comprehensive search of the room and surrounding areas.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the investigation did not yield any evidence to substantiate the claim of theft. While we understand this may not be the outcome you hoped for, we want to assure you that we explored every possible avenue to uncover what happened. We also understand that you discovered the alleged loss of money several hours after checking out of the property. Given the time that had elapsed and the locations you may have visited after leaving Uga Bay, it is challenging to determine where the money was lost. 

As a policy, during check-in, we inform all our guests that in-room safes are provided for the secure storage of valuable items. Utilizing this facility is always the best way to ensure the safety of your belongings.

We strive to provide the highest level of service and support to all our guests, and we are disappointed to learn that we fell short of your expectations in this instance. Your feedback is valuable, and we will use it to improve our internal processes and staff training to ensure a better experience for our guests in the future.

We value your patronage and hope that this unfortunate incident will not deter you from considering Uga Bay in the future. We would welcome the opportunity to provide you with the exceptional experience that our guests have come to expect. Please feel free to contact us directly if you would like to discuss this matter further.

Thank you for sharing your feedback on your stay at Uga Bay.

Your reservation was made for a twin beach studio and we had allocated the same for your stay. All our guest rooms are in pods of four, not five or more as mentioned in your feedback, situated on either side of the main pool and are diagonally placed in such a way that we have two beach studios in the ground level and ocean studio on the upper level, which offer views of the beach and ocean. All our twin rooms are located in the pods closer to the main building as such was yours. As per our service norm, all room allocations are made by booking specifications, and are not segregated for foreigners or locals.

Since the twin room was not to your liking, we moved you to an Ocean Studio, which consists of a king-size bed. All our Beach and Ocean Studios are of the same size, structure and design. The interior of our rooms follow our own design ethos, which is signature to Uga. We have taken into account guest comfort by placing the TV in front of the bed, from where uninterrupted views of the ocean and beach can be enjoyed through the glass sliding windows. All amenities on offer are listed on our website by room category. Bluetooth speakers, bathtub and espresso machines are available in our higher room categories, being the Bay Suite and Beach Villa.

Uga Bay was the 3rd hotel to launch in Pasikudah Bay in 2012 and since then we have very closely worked with the local communities to enhance their livelihoods. While we have a great mix of professionals in our team, 42% of our staff are from the local area, some of whom have been working with us since inception. At Uga, we have sustainability at the heart of everything we do including a long-list of CSR projects which includes training youth from the area.

Our rooms are designed to be sound proof; however, we do apologize if there was any disturbance. We also regret that our culinary offering was not to your liking. We are committed to continuously improving the standards. Our team is dedicated to ensure all our guests have a comfortable stay however; we regret that in this instance you were not entirely satisfied.","1536","625096873","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/a9/caption.jpg","2048","1536","625096874","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/aa/caption.jpg","2048","1536","625096875","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/ab/caption.jpg","2048","2048","625096876","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/ac/caption.jpg","1536","2048","625096877","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/ad/caption.jpg","1536","1536","625096878","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/42/38/ae/caption.jpg","2048",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coconut Board Road, Kalkudah 30410 Sri Lanka","Kalkudah","Sri Lanka","30410",,"Coconut Board Road",,"3682420","7.926738","Kalkudah, Eastern Province","81.56156","Uga Bay","2053","4.8","4","10","61","257","1722","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2193270-d3682420-Reviews-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html","http://www.ugaescapes.com/ugabay/","2022-08-17","MOBILE","2","Avoid the rooms in the back. They don’t belong to any category advertised. 

Try only staying in rooms on left  when facing the ocean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent beach hotel. Wouldn’t call it a five star or luxury boutique hotel. It’s more like a three star beach hotel. Here’s my detailed view of different aspects of the hotel from the experience.

Rooms
Booked a beach studio. The pictures indicated on the website are two ground level studios (beach studio category) and two upper level studios (Ocean studio category) with separate entrances.

We were initially given a room on the back that has like five or more rooms on the bottom and five on top. This is not even mentioned on the website. Furthermore our room was next to the bar and they were setting up for a themed dinner right in front of it. It was noisy as the management was giving staff on the spot instructions on how to set up. A meeting should have been held and this setup should have been done when guests were not in the rooms quaintly. I thought it was very unprofessional.

What ticked me off is that on this particular block with substandard rooms, only locals were put in. Didn’t see a single foreigner and they were all in the actual studios advertised with much better views and less disturbance. Coming from another beautiful boutique resort in Kalkudah where we got treated equally, I felt discriminated here.

If you book here make sure they don’t put you in the back. This should actually be turned into staff accommodation. It seems that way because it doesn’t go with the rest of the theme at all. Maybe they turned the staff rooms to guest rooms later to maximize profits.

We were later moved to an ocean suite which was nicer. Once there I realized the architect has copied the hotel next door (Mallu Mallu). They have given emphasis on the guests watching TV avoiding the possibility of a mesmerizing East Coast sunrise-view from bed! Recommend to redo the interior and if possible to rebuild the structures to the right when looking at the ocean to face the sunrise.

Other than that the amenities were decent. But not as a five star hotel which they claim to be. Only instant coffee. No Nespresso or simpler capsule coffee machine, no bathtub in studio, no Bluetooth entertainment system.

Food
The Sri Lankan dinner buffet and the set menu for lunch were good. But the breakfast spread was not good. The cheese (only two) was bland and dry possibly locally made. Not a single shooter as in five star hotel. No salmon or even tuna. Local coffee they served was watery and wasn’t brewed properly. At this dane age there’s access to many good local coffees such has Soul or Aga coffee plus it’s not an excuse for such a hotel to give excuses about import restrictions. Because these things are still widely available in Sri Lanka. This was commercial scale Harischandra or similar coffee which is just not real coffee and so outdated in 2022. It’s not hard for include a machine made cappuccino or latte with freshly grinned beans for breakfast without asking to pay extra. After all this is the most expensive hotel in Pasikuda. For me my whole day depends on the coffee I have and it ruined my day!

Staff
They are nice and pleasant but not exceptional. Some are very outspoken which doesn’t  go with a low key calm place like Pasikuda. Didn’t like them talking about work, guests, and planing so guests overhear. Major practical change management is needed here by an expert.

Also I noticed the staff were mainly Sinhalese speaking from far away areas. They have not hired locally hence the staff were not experienced to advise about anything outside the hotel. Hence it’s a major question on the CSR of Uga. I think hiring locally is key. Many talented Tamil and Muslims in the area. They will add a lot of character to the hotel.

Hotel
It’s too small and they have tried to maximize the little space they have by building structures too close to each other.  Feels campy and on your face. However it does have a lot of amenities such as a gym, pool and spa.

We only stayed here for one night and didn’t extend our stay. If you’re looking for a true five star resort I would recommend Anathaya Resort & Spa which was so much better.","Not a Five Star and Mismanaged","2022-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r854772287-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Sure the staff are lovely and friendly but there needs to be more training or better process put in place. It should not take 30 minutes to have a drink served or an hour for a chicken burger to arrive in a 5 star hotel. The rooms are adequate and spacious with a tiny ill designed wardrobe and in concrete blocks of 4. The ocean suites do not have much of a view of the ocean being abscured by the palm trees but not a major problem. The beach is clean and nice, the sea not crystal clear and no snorkelling anywhere close or off the beach directly if thats your interest. There is plenty of natural shade and umbrellas to escape the heat and the swimming pool is pleasant and well designed, as well as very warm. The beach bar serve decent snacks at reasonable cost when they eventually arrive but the main restaurant is like a noisy concrete canteen with the worst design and layout i have come across. The chairs are too big for the tiny tables and hence you feel crammed in, not being able to to move easily out of your seat without asking your partner to move their chair or bashing your neighbour. The a la carte served decent food but took ages to arrive depending on what time you ordered and the buffet on the two nights i had it was of average standard. Staff seemed to concentrate on getting bills signed instead of serving but not sure this is their fault.
Management should have stepped in earlier when the freeloading family who decided they wanted to use the hotels facilities without paying for them arrived for the day and ignored the poor pool attendant who was left to deal with them. If you can read, and you were english to my embarrassment, you are nothing more than petty fare dodgers who should be ashamed of yourselves.

Thanks you for this feedback and we really appreciate your sincere sentiments about your recent stay at Uga Bay. 

We regret that the weather wasn't all that great during your stay and while we have no control over the weather, Passikudah is arguably one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka to swim in, due to the reef protected bay, most times of the year.  

As you've enjoyed the accommodation and the food on offer we hope you will give us the opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel in the near future.

The beach area looks very nice with smooth white sands and the view of the coconut trees from a distance, but it was almost always windy during our 2-nights stay. The ocean was rough therefore did not offer pleasant swimming experience. I don't know if this is always the case. Given the unpleasant swimming experience the ocean offered, it is difficult to understand why the deepest part of the swimming pool is only 4ft which makes the swimming experience of the pool also unpleasant. 

We have learned that the East coast and the Pasikuda area is an upcoming area for new resorts, therefore the hotel is new. Our room was very spacious, modern and comfortable. We also had a pleasant balcony overlooking the garden. Although our room was supposed to be ocean view, we had no ocean view at all. The staff told us that most of the rooms had ""partial"" views because of the palm trees. 

The breakfast and the dinner experience was good. The food and beverage manager is doing a great job.

Thank you for submitting your feedback and regret that we were unable to satisfy you entirely on this occasion.

At all Uga Escapes properties we take great care in maintaining stringent hygiene processes to ensure that the food we prepare  and serve will always be of high standards.
 
We do not have a full time doctor resident at the hotel however we do have a designated doctor who is always on call and given that the request was made at 5:30am, we believe the doctor attended within a reasonable time. We will continue to improve our standards keeping the best interest of our guests in mind.

Once again we are sorry that you were not able to enjoy your stay with us fully and hope to welcome you again to our resort in the near future.

The buffet food is adequate, but steer clear of the alacarte. They managed to give my wife a severe case of food poisoning, by serving almost raw chicken. Two bites was all it took. There is no doctor on site, he is 30 minutes plus away. We had a visit (to our room) by the chef, who was extremely worried, not about my wife, but about his reputation.

Thank you for taking the time to post your feedback 

We are very much passionate about the cuisine offered and as we were at near full occupancy, in addition to our A la carte options we offered a buffet spread to add more variety.

Being located right on the beach this is a rare occasions where a dog strayed on to the hotel grounds.  The staff on this occasion had acted in the best interest of the other guests and it is unfortunate that you perceived it as callous.

Would like to thank you once again for staying with us we look forward to welcoming you back to Uga Bay.

Once again we regret your experience at Uga Bay wasn't a pleasant one and we request you to treat this as an aberration and far from our usual high standards of service. We very much look forward to an welcoming you back to Uga Bay.

Despite the many positive reviews on TripAdvisor, and being rated number one in Kalkudah, our experience at Uga Bay was  far from that!

The rooms were fairly spacious and clean, which was the only positive aspect about the hotel.

We had such a horrendous experience of finding a cockroach in the complimentary fruit platter served to us and the issue was hushed  up by offering us four little chocolates on a massive platter by the management with no proper apology!

The overly helpful staff rather annoying, with about five different staff asking us how our experience was,knowing too well it was rather poor! 

The food at the hotel was the worst let down no doubt, with us being notified that there was no buffet as the hotel was in low occupancy at the time. We were given a menu with not much of a choice to choose from. The seafood options were very limited despite Uga being a beachfront hotel in the east coast of Sri Lanka.The food was tasteless to add more to the disappointment. Breakfast the  following morning was more or less the same experience and we were thankful that we went with the half-board option at the time of booking! 

The much looked forward to private dining experience on the beach also resulted in utter disappointment with the management deciding to take the beach dining experience indoors due to the heavy rain and insisting that the experience would be no different.The 25% cost reduction the management kindly offered us did not however compensate for the lack of ambiance or much rather for the unexciting food!

The main, which consisted of a seafood platter with 'big' prawns, and 'lobster' was a pathetic attempt of a meal. Again,the management underestimated our awareness of identifying or rather tasting 'shoe lobster' offered to us in the guise of real lobster.
  

Overall my husband and I were rather disappointed about our experience at Uga Bay as it certainly did not live up to the expectations, reviews or value for the price we paid!","A real let down of a 'boutique' hotel","2015-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r266928519-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

1) Service - waiters were friendly and front desk staff polite.

2) Room - our room was very nice and was probably the best thing about this resort.

3) Location - I think during the prime season the Beach would be nice, but in December you can't really swim in the ocean.

4) Food - unfortunately the food here was a huge disappointment.  My husband is not a picky eater at all and even he couldn't stomach most of the food.  When I resorted to only ordering 'safe' food, I ended up having to spit out bones from a club sandwich. Gross. In the end, I skipped either lunch or dinner each day due to the poor food quality and that's saying a lot because I'm not one to ever miss a meal!

Miscellaneous items:
- hair dryer provided
- free wifi

General trip notes:

Having now spent 18 days touring around the country, I would definitely say that this hotel is at the bottom of the pile and in my opinion should be skipped due to the lack of food quality alone. For reference, here are the hotels we stayed in (listed in order of overall preference based on the categories above):
1) Madulkelle Tea & Eco Lodge, Madulkelle (Boutique hotel/ ""glamping"" - yet surprisingly nicer than our 5 star hotels)
2) The Frangipani Tree, Galle (Boutique hotel)
3) Aliya Resort & Spa, Sigiriya (5 star*)
4) Melheim Resort, Haputale (Boutique hotel)
5) Hilton Colombo (5 star*)
6) Uga Bay, Kalkudah (5 star*)

5 star* -> FYI - 5 star standards in Sri Lanka are much lower than what we find in Canada/Australia/UK.  Uga bay is definitely not a 5 star property.

Thanks you for your feedback & we are happy to note you liked the food & service of our staff. We however regret that we were unable to satisfy you completely during your stay with us.

The beach villa which directly faces the Indian Ocean unfortunately bore the brunt of the heavy gushes of wind and torrential rains experienced during the peak of the north eastern monsoon.  This resulted in one ceiling panels outside the by the pool giving way.  We at this point did offer the guests occupying the Villa, the Bay Suite located in the main building. We also regret the door lock of the bath room jamming in this instance, I was made to understand that the resort staff attended to this matter immediately.

The location of our underground spa did experience a leakage which could not be identified and the spa was temporarily closed and subsequently moved to room in the main building. 

We are glad that you did not experience any issues in your room and that it was to your liking. I’m sure you’ll appreciate that we had the bay suite on stand-by and unoccupied to offer the guests in case they changed their mind.

Once again thank you for this feedback and I’m pleased to inform you that we have rectified all issues with the beach villa and we hope you would have a change of heart to visit us again so we can offer you a better experience at Uga Bay.

This year the suggestion was to stay at Uga Bay.1 villa & 1 double room. We had such terrible issues.

Firstly, the architecture is rather strange at the entrance as you feel you are walking into a Teletubbies styled place! And not the most welcoming reception. 

In the Villa - 1) the bathroom door got locked while one of the older children were inside and 5 men from the hotel had to come to break open it!!! 2) later while having a shower, the water stopped 3) the ceiling by the side of the pool deck in the villa fell off 4) the dining area in the villa had this horrible smell . We believe it was from the shells 
used for part of the flooring under the staircase. 5) overall lighting was very dim specially in the bathrooms. 6) Spa - flooring was full of water due to the rain and not really a nice experience walking in. Hence we went over to the next hotel for our spa treatment. 

Few positives - 
1) staff - inspite of horrible construction issues , the staff reacted fast to address our issues. 
2) Food - excellent food. Kudos to the Chef 
We were given a price reduction on the final bill due to all the issues  the villa had , but why would you even have such issues to begin with ??? 
Not the best hotel & sadly cannot be recommended unless you come over from another hotel on the strip for their meals

This hotel came highly recommended and we wanted to experience it for ourselves. After a long drive we arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the beautiful view of the beach and warm ambience of the hotel. The front office staff was friendly & attentive & without a delay we checked into our room. 

The room was spacious, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The bathroom was large and fitted with all modern amenities. The room opened out to a beautiful pristine beach that seemed to stretch for miles. The wifi was very fast and cable TV had a large selection of channels which is not offered in many hotels. The housekeeping staff was very attentive and did a great job of keeping the rooms clean even after we had trailed in sand from our walks on the beach.   

We had booked on FB and so proceeded to have lunch which to our surprise was set menu,a detail which the hotel or the head office failed to mention when making the booking or when calling repeatedly to check our time of arrival. Sadly the food at this hotel was a very big letdown. The set menu had very limited options and so we optioned for a rice and curry and a seafood option. The rice and curry was cooked in the traditional Sri Lankan way and tasted nice while the seafood dish was very poorly done. It contained one grilled prawn and a small overcooked piece of fish with some badly done vegetables. Dinner turned out to be no better with limited variety of dishes on offer including a stir fried crab which was overcooked and tough. 

Also beware of what you order via room service as they can get the order wrong even after repeating the order multiple times. We ordered a sandwich and specifically asked them not to include pork which they did not adhere to.

Breakfast was passable but with almost the same dishes being served on both days. Another issue was the time taken to make to-order items such as eggs, as there was only one person manning three stations. 

So all in all what this hotel offers in beauty it lacks in its food. They need to offer a variety of food to their guests and make seafood items the hero of the dish. I was overall disappointed in the hotel and its standards as it certainly did not live upto the expectations, reviews or the price it commands.","Beautiful View but Disappointing Food","2014-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r245245673-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Firstly thank you for patronizing Uga Bay again and we do appreciate your feedback, especially since you've stayed at our property before.

We are quite disappointed that you had a negative experience at our hotel on your recent visit and therefore have taken your feedback very seriously. Being a relatively new hotel and operating at near 100% occupancy levels we've encountered some operational issues which we aim to continuously improve. Do be rest assured that we've put in place several measures to address service concerns and are making steady progress. 

We thank you once again for your patronage and look forward to welcoming you back where hopefully, we should be able to create a more positive impression of the resort on your mind.

We have stayed here before and it was great, but this time around the food was awful and the service even worse. The managers float around without really doing anything about the poor quality of service. It took them half an hour to get a photocopy and the room service we ordered for lunch was cleared away only the next morning, and then put outside our room for the crows. Up until we left the stuff was still there, even after I informed the managers. My thought is that if they are going to make excuses they are never going to get their act together. I really wish something will actually be done about this as this is the most beautiful hotel in Passikudah and my kids love it compared to Malu Malu.","Awful service","2013-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r175066913-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

We booked a jungle cabin and a lagoon cabin. I am a frequent traveller who has visit a lot of luxury resorts in SL speally the chain resorts such as cinnamon, jetwing, aithken spence, etc. However I have to say I was very disappointed with the overall product offered by Uga Jungle beach. 

First off, before I get to the negatives, I have to highlight the absolute positive and exceptional service provided by each and every member of the staff. The staff is extremely well trained and very very friendly and professional. From the host who welcomed us with a araliya flower to the porters, servers, house keeping staff, etc all the staff is very well trained and tried their best to give us a great service. Special call out to Mithila in the restaurant who served us very professionally and her amazing hard work deserves a lot of praise.

HOWEVER, let me explain why this deserves a one star, even after such great staff and service :

1. Quality of the rooms - Being a 5 star UGA resort, I would expect the rooms to be modern, clean and well maintained. However the truth is far from this - The rooms are run down and torn out. The walls are stained and the paint is peeling off. The cupboard and furniture were old, rusted and was not clean. The sofa had stains on it and the bed surely had bed bugs because the very first morning, I was itching beyond comfort. The TV is placed in such an odd way that watching it from the sofa or bed is near impossible. The washrooms are old, untidy and seriously not impressive at all. My absolute anger was the quality of the water bottles provided in the room. The water bottles were sealed in glass bottles (Kudos for not using plastic),  but the water tasted absolutely old, rusty and honestly very plastic-like. DISGUSTING.

2. Quality of the food - Being a foodie myself, this was where UGA really disappointed me. Let me start with dinner. The set menu was very poorly constructed and lacked any sort of cohesiveness. The bread rolls were hard as rocks, the butter served was broken and the clear crab soup I had was absolutely bland, no salt whatsoever and  honestly tasted like water that remains when you wash off a crab. The disappointment of the evening was the so called ""Beef wellington"". I have attached a photo below and you can see how overcooked the beef is. It was so disgustingly hard than it was almost un-edible. It lacked the signature mustard and prosciutto and the pastry was absolutely soggy. This dish is the worst I have ever had at a restaurant in my life! The mud pie for dessert was nice I have to say. Onto breakfast - For the first time in my life I was served an eggs benedict with a poached egg which was overcooked! Attached photo below. Was absolutely sad to be honest. I am sorry to sound entitled but I have dined at Rare by Uga in colombo, and i KNOW this is NOT the standards for food that UGA has. This is absolutely horrible and ruined my vacation to be honest.

3. Facilities - Poor facilities. The pool was not clean, the games room was (sorry), but a joke.

Overall I am sorry to see UGA which is a chain which I respected, letting me and my family down. I do not want to sound like a snob, however if I pay a premium for a high end resort, I expect the decency of the management to give every guest a value for what they pay. 

I am an advocate for business development so please feel free to reach out to me for any more details on this and I am happy to help. Again I have to say amidst all this, the staff was absolutely amazing. But due to this poor experience, I will not be visiting any UGA property and will definitely not recommend this to anyone.

Management of UGA - please get your house in order!!! Peoples vacation time should be respected!","Shockingly dissapointing! Horrible food and quality!","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r946756410-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

Having stayed at this property and thoroughly enjoyed this in 2017 we chose to book this hotel for my husbands special birthday. It’s safe to say they truly ruined the experience. The positives of this property is the beautiful spacious clean beach huts and the idyllic almost deserted private beach. That’s where it ends. The food quality is sub standard lacking flavour or finesse for a 5 star property. I had made arrangements from London prior to our arrival  to have a private beach dinner bbq for my husbands birthday evening. The quality of the bbq was disgusting the crabs barely had any meat and overall the whole meal lacked flavour. I’ve never had lobster that tasted so bad. The starter was poor essentially tinned tuna in a vile sauce and the ‘uga dessert experience’ was thawed ice cream with tinned fruit. The dinner was not private at all even though this was agreed in London. We were placed amongst lots of other guests walking past breathing all over our bbq and enjoying the beach bonfire taking selfies that was paid for by us. It really soured the mood of my husbands birthday. Furthermore we were so disappointed and were told by dhameka that we could have complimentary drinks including to our room. This was not the case at checkout my husband was charged $44 for one gin and tonic. Absurd! They ruined my husbands birthday which is unforgivable we will never return or recommend this hotel to any of our friends and family which is a shame as this is the 2nd time we stayed here. It must be noted we were refunded for private beach dining and overpriced drink but it will not fix the sour taste left at this hotel.","Horrible experience","2023-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r894240212-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

We were planning this stay for months and months with our friends and family and altogether we made a reservation for 04 rooms as this was a crowd of 12.

We checked into the hotel around 1.30pm and observed how unpleasantly the security guard was welcoming us. But we honestly disregard thinking that maybe he doesn’t speak Sinhala well. Then we were happily welcomed by the receptionist and after having the welcome drink the restaurant manager came in and gave all of us the menu for lunch stating that it will take bit of a time to arrange the meals. Mind it, it was a la carte menu. Then the manager came to me and my wife to note down the order. Then we mentioned, out of the two options under starters that we prefer ‘Spring rolls’. Then the manager’s response was “Okay then I will arrange 10 Spring rolls”. Then my wife said, “you better ask for others preferences as there are 04 families and this will be our preference”. Then again the manager’s tone got bit wild and he said “it is difficult for us to manage a group like that as we cannot find the guests. It’s better you stay at one table rather sitting here and there”. Myself and my wife looked at each other surprisingly to this so called restaurant manager and then I said “why don’t you take the order as per the room number as that’s how it happens everywhere”. Luckily the receptionist was listening to our argument type conversation and confirmed what I suggest and then he silently note down the order.

After checking into rooms, we came back to the restaurant to have our lunch. To my surprise, we had to wait for good 30 minutes to get the starter to our table. There were two waiters and this so-called restaurant manager came near the table but until such time they could only fill up the glasses. After several inquiries and waiting another 20-25 minutes we got the main course. And here comes the desserts. My wife ordered ice cream where as I ordered a fruit platter but we both received ice cream. Then I politely said, I ordered a fruit platter but you have given me ice cream. This so-called proficient restaurant manager who took our order raised his voice saying that “No! you ordered ice cream, you didn’t mention about a fruit platter”.  He showed his professionalism very well. His irritated behaviour, impoliteness completely ruined the positive image we had of this hotel.

It was the same when we came to have our dinner. We kept waiting for 25 minutes to have the dinner and after that we had to call several waiters asking to serve us dessert. And not to our surprise it was the very same on the next day breakfast time. We almost waited for 40 minutes. Food was dry (Sri Lankan menu – String hoppers, bread slices, small meal portions, unhygienic (crows flying with your food which is on the table and cats under the table) made us intolerant. So then I started to raise my voice to the restaurant manager and I showed him everything which was on the table and all he could say was “Sorry Sir”. I could only think of his lack of leadership to manage his crew and carelessness towards the local guests.

That one thing I clearly noticed is that the way the hotel treats the locals. It is disgusting and sad to see how they neglect the locals over foreigners. If the delays are due to a common problem it should be for everyone. But sadly it was not like that.

Front door of the room 40 could not be opened
Bashing and banging above us at room 40 so we were changed after unpacking to another room 37. 
Fridge not working at all in new room. Changed fridge and because of Heat Exchange type fridge it takes overnight to cool. We were given an Eski with ice in it to cool our soft drinks and the three Lion Beers I have per day. Fixed after two days. 
We find ourselves stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do. No activities. 
The supposed Lagoon View is of a busy noisy highway. 
The Air Conditioner sounds like a Thunderstorm followed by Heavy Rain every time it cuts in. 
When we shower we have to stand in our own wast water due to no drainage. Even the next morning our waste water still stays in the Shower. 
The Front Awning is Ripped and Streached and with the continuous wind is Flapping making a thunderous bang all day and night. 
The Bed makes a massive Creak each time one of us gets out, thus waking the other. Worked on but not fixed. Still noisy. 
Half Board Dinner offers Soup, Starter, Main and Desert. We were told in no uncertain terms that we are only entitled to Three of the Four. Fixed after two nights. 
The Internet isn’t working correctly. As I have spare time along the way I Play an Internet Bridge Game and World Series Poker Game these have worked at all other sights.   As I appear to have lots of spare time with nothing to do here this is annoying. Fixed after three nights. 
We were told that at this time of year Trincomalee and Passikudah have the best weather for beach activities. It is and has been blowing 25 to 30 Kim wind for our whole stay and we are told this is normal. We would not have come to a Beach stay if we knew that. 

Manager Front Office has been helping with the above faults. There are only some that she can help with the rest we have to put up with. We should not have to Put Up With any shortfalls in 4 and 5 Star Accommodation that we paid for.

Thank you for reaching out to us and letting us know about your experience at Jungle Beach. We regret to hear that you had some concerns during you stay. Our prices are very much in line with the services we offer and other five star resorts. All tourist establishments are subject to government taxes and service charge which amount to 29.08%. 
We sincerely apologize for the confusion in the billing system at the bar, but I trust it was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention.  We regret that this was noted detected prior to presenting the bill. We take matters such as incorrect billing very seriously and we have addressed this with the staff concerned and they have been advised to pay closer attention to detail and leave no room for human error. 
Again, I am sorry that you departed disappointed, that was certainly never our intention and it saddens us to know that we have failed to deliver the experience that we are renowned for. 

If your travels do bring you back to Sri Lanka, please give us an opportunity to serve you better and we assure you that  that your stay will be  memorable.

know before booking this hotel. In all the facilities are OK but not 5 star by any means. The main redeeming feature was the appetite to make money dishonestly. Here are some things you should know before booking this hotel:

1) it’s extortionate- the prices here (once you read the fine print and include the taxes) are akin to London prices. Don’t expect to pay less than £8-10
2) check your bill! We had a situation whereby items we ordered didn’t show up and were charged anyway.
3) double check your bill! We also had instances where drinks ordered were allocated to our room twice (once from initial order, second time from us chasing the staff).
4) the “Happy hour” doesn’t exist. We were charged on two occasions for the usual price for so called happy hour (half price drinks).
5) the amenities shut very early, don’t expect food or service after around 10-10:30pm.
6) the pond is dirty and the fish gasp for air. There is insufficient oxygen flow, and it’s hard to watch.

We do not scrimp on holiday, but do not appreciate being incorrectly charged. When we left, and highlighted incorrect charges ( which also included a round of drinks from another table!) we received no apology, only an acknowledgement of our delay in leaving!

While the secluded beach is lovely, and most of the staff is nice, we felt trapped and ripped off at every turn, and left leaving with a bad taste in our mouth . The resort is best-suited for travelers who don't want activities besides the beach, don't mind being overcharged for absolutely everything, and prefer resorts to interacting with the real Sri Lanka. You can find more competitive rates at hotels closer to town. FWIW, we loved the Cinnamon properties we stayed at. 

Below is a summary of our main concerns:
1) Price gouging:
Within a few hours of checking in, the hotel started trying to gouge us by trying to make us pay a second person occupancy additional fee that was never mentioned to us during booking or check-in, and being incredibly rude and aggressive in pursuing this until we threatened to leave. This is ridiculous because: a) we checked in with two passports and no one mentioned this upon check-in, b) all amenities in the room we were given was for two people and the hotel's own daily newsletters asks that you not walk alone on the property demonstrating that they mean to accommodate couples or groups. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH THE JUNGLE BEACH WEBSITE. Later, after some research, we realized that the Jungle Beach website tacks on tons of extra fees (occupancy, 30% tax) but only does so at the last page after you've already approved of your rate. This is handled differently by other price comparison websites like hotels.com / Expedia / booking.com etc. which defaults to 2-person occupancy without tacking on hidden costs or surcharges at the very end. They also tend to offer cheaper rates. 

2) Remote location with little to no option to leave the premises:
The hotel is a 30-min drive or 40-min tuk tuk ride to the center of Trincomalee. This needs to be more clearly advertised when you are booking. This means that all your food, drink, activities and any other needs need to be taken care of by the hotel. Forget about buying sunscreen or extra medicines or toiletries - there's no gift shop or arrangements so you have to arrange a visit into the city. While the hotel is able to organize a tuk-tuk for you, they neither advertise or encourage it, and they won't let outside tuk-tuks or cabs even onto their premises to pick you up if it is pre-arranged. Given the remote location, it is standard for a resort like this to offer either complimentary or a discounted shuttle service into the city. 

3) Overpriced airport transfer to Trinco: The hotel charges ~$70 for a 1-hour taxi transfer to the Trincomalee Airport where Air Taxis (Cinnamon and other operators) take off. This absolutely is not competitive pricing and is exploitative of guests. As this is a developing country, $70 is more than you would pay to rent a cab for regional travel for an entire day in Sri Lanka. The going rate is 80 LKR per KM of travel so the cab fare (even if you double it to account for the lack of a return fare) should be no more than $35, making it half of what the hotel charges.

4) Limited range of activities, none free
The hotel releases a newsletter of activities available for the next day, but virtually all of the activities stay the same from day to day and are limited to pricey outdoor/ nature activities to spa activities. There are no gym classes, cultural activities, and nothing is free. The few beach toys they advertise as ""free"" is limited to one beach volleyball, and no one seems to be able to locate it. So remember if you stay here, you're basically stuck at the resort WITH NOTHING TO DO - no library, no gift shop, no board games, nothing that you would expect for a resort at this price.","Average, secluded hotel that tries to rip you off at every turn","2017-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r489270645-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

The service level of our staff is usually highly appreciated and the fine culinary experience we offer is well esteemed by guests. However I understand you did not share a similar sentiment. We regret to hear this while your comments have been shared with the team. 

As you suggest, pruning the trees around is against our policy as we like to maintain the natural environment as it is. Hence the reason why we have camouflaged our cabins with minimal visual impact both at ground level and from above.

Your feedback is appreciated and we do hope you will stay with us again in the near future.

Dear Guest,

Thank you for staying at Jungle Beach and taking your valuable time off to review. 

We are very pleased to hear that overall you are happy with the ambiance of the room and the service level of our staff. However we regret to hear that you were not entirely satisfied with your stay. 

Please be assured that our prices are very much in par with the industry standards based on the service we provide and the fine culinary experience we offer is usually highly appreciated by our guests. 
Being an eco-friendly resort surrounded by natural fauna and flora it is difficult for us to prevent occasional  bugs visiting the premises. We cannot completely mitigate this as it goes against our principal of being a nature friendly resort as they have become a part and parcel of the hotel’s dedicated efforts in biodiversity conservation. We have experienced naturalists at the hotel and they are always available for any assistance. 

We value feedback from all our guests as we strive to continuously improve our guest experience.
We do hope that you will find an opportunity to stay with us again in the future.

Thank you!

The staff are great! very friendly and attentive, the room was gorgeous. The outdoor showers in the room was fun. The spa was not bad, the massages were acceptable.

The Bad:
 - Prices - you are captive. there are no restaurants near by. I might as well have been staying at the Ritz in Wailea. Everything was ridiculously expensive. Not what I expected in Sri Lanka. The food was ok, not amazing (for great food go to Colombo). The prices made the food a lot less appetizing

С трудом выяснили: они хотят получить предоплату. Всю. Хотя бронь была с опцией бесплатной отмены.
С таким отношением к клиентам, которые возвращаются в отель снова сталкиваемся впервые на Шри-Ланке впервые за 15 лет.
Связался с отелем сети  Intercontinental в ОАЭ.
На тот же срок НВ + (в Maalu-Maalu алкоголь оплачивается отдельно) в люксовой сети цена меньше, трансфер бесплатный оплата по прибытии в отеле.

First and foremost, allow me to thank you for sharing your recent experience at our resort. 
Please accept our sincere apologies for having given you cause to express your disappointment on certain issues.

We do take offense that you question our integrity and our reviews. We can assure you that they are all paying customers that enjoy our concept, property, and service standards that have been worked hard to maintain since our inception in 2011. If you are unsure, please have a look at our reviews on OTAs such as booking.com that are off a similar level and standing as our TripAdvisor reviews and rating. If you have any evidence of us tampering with reviews, please feel free to send any evidence to TripAdvisor or directly to us. 

We would like to inform you that the reservation has been made a month prior to your visit using our website, also the site clearly indicates that the suite cluster is shared among 4 rooms & the facilities,

Your comments about the food and less variety, which surprises us as it is one of our main concerns and a major factor to differ us from others which has resulted in more and more repeater clients along with lots of positive comments. Further, I wish to state that we have offered you a discount if you are willing to dine in our other outlet which is what you have done during your stay,

The decision taken to open a resort on the east coast – Pasikuda after 30 years of civil war is purely to uplift the local community from unemployment & financial crisis. We strongly believe that locals, as well as foreigners, should have access to our resort. During the last 3 years, we have survived with the local market which has ensured that we can continue our business and more importantly pay our employees. Therefore, we don’t believe in refusing locals and we will stick by our policy

The concerns pointed on GYM & the pool are duly noted and we will look into them as we always strive our self to make sure on comfort and safety of our esteemed guests

We would also like to bring up the point that the corridor image you have shared is located in the staff-only area and is long away from the guest areas 

We have noted all your constructive feedback and can assure you we will work in rectifying our shortcomings wherever possible. Thank you for bringing up those matters to our attention,

Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience caused and we hope that you will give us an opportunity to welcome you back again to enjoy our hospitality which Maalu Maalu is renowned.
Warm Regards,
Resort Manager.

Their advertising is at best misleading, but i would say it is false advertising. The hotel is known in Pasikuda as paying for false reviews from locals. It is so far behind the other hotels on this beach you really shouldnt stay here. Do not believe the glossy photos!!!

The hotel charges substantially less for locals and when we were there it had bus loads of locals decending on the hotel enmasse for buffet and around the place.

Restaurants:
- DO NOT ORDER THE BUFFET. There is one very poor, limited selection buffet and one beach restaurant. The other restaurants dont exist or are ""closed and dusty"". The beach restaurant does decent food and our lobster and fresh fish plus french wines came in at HALF the price of the buffet (buffet was USD54.50 per person per night including children)
- they advertise 4 or 5 restaurants. this isnt the case. It is false advertising. there are two.
- the main restaurant is a sauna even at 8pm at night.

Gym
- is a dangerous disaster with everything falling apart (see pic).

Pools
- both main pool and our plunge pool had bugs in it. bugs that live in the pool, not floating on top.

Rooms
- we paid UDS900 per night for 2 ocean view suites. They are advertised with a plunge pool. This is shared between FOUR apartments (see pic of 4 apartments who use one pool). When we turned up there were 8 people in our allocated plunge pool. It isnt exclusive even to the four apartments so you pay for something you dont get. 
- appointment is at best shabby chic. or you could say 2-3* hotel. They are best described as Premier Inn (UK) or Travelodge / Motel 6.
- there is junk piled up in corridors between rooms

Management
- our daughter noticed and we then couldnt unsee it that the managers are nice to guests, but then immediately lose their smile and are angry at all the staff. We had a situation where we wanted a plate cleared from our table and asked the manager. He then asked someone else so we had two men standing pointing at a plate whilst the poor waiter rushed over to clear. We didnt see this anywhere in Sri Lanka and this is our 10th visit.

We left two days into our four day stay as it is so bad. For somewhere great stay at the 5* Uga Bay next door which is magnificent in every way. 

It definitely isn't a place we could recommend.","THIS IS A 2-3* HOTEL NOT A 4 of 5* HOTEL","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r905963677-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

We had two small vertical windows in our room and only one lamp. It was dark and gloomy.

The mattresses were also all buckled making for a very uncomfortable sleep. You sleep in a cocoon basically.

As usual, vegetarian options are very limited. You can not in good conscience offer 2x chicken curries, fish curry, lamb curry and then force the vegetarians to eat only dhal and a few small side dishes (without gravy)where are the vegetarian skewers? Where is the veg meat/soya meat.

While taking note of your remark, we would like to emphasize on the fact that we have been running on full occupancy during the weekends and not received any negative comment on food. However, remarks on food are always subjective and what appeals to one might not appeal to another. 

We hope that you will visit our other Theme resorts & Spas properties and experience our hospitality and have a memorable time.

We were at the Anilana, near by and had a pretty bad welcome from the front office manager. But changing venues was a hassle so we decided to stay. We were prevented from going beyond the main dining area as outsiders (whilst rules are understood and necessary - exceptions are welcome - the lack of which inconvenienced us at the end of a wonderful yet tiring day in Batti).

So this review is only for the staff and the dining and NOT For the accommodation.  The waiting staff were decent and pleasant. However the buffer priced at Rs.3500 was a waste of money because whatever they set out for the buffet vanished thanks to a large group that was hogging the entire space. (they were not there when we decided to have our meal here). The spread was basic to average compared to similar grade hotels, lacked taste and some items were quite dry. No adequate sauces and dressings (probably the group downed it all)

Point 1: I received a call on the 13th asking about my arrival (the time etc), I mentioned that I will be arriving at 12:30 PM, and I was informed that the check-in was at 2:30 PM which I was ok with. So after a very long drive from Colombo on the 14th, our family arrived at 12:30 pm and we were welcomed etc and we started with Lunch cause the room was only gonna get ready by 2:30 PM. At 2:30 PM I went to reception and asked about my room. It was only then that the manager rushed to the room and got the guys to clean the room for us and told us that it will take 15 mints to get the room ready. at 2:45 I went again to reception and inquired about the room, the manager there mentioned that the room is still not ready and that it'll take another 45 mints. This was a great concern as my parents and all of us were so tired after a long drive and we were made to sit outside till the room was ready. I believe that the ""first impression is the best impression"" and the first impression for us was so bad.

Point 2: The AC on the upper deck of the room was not cooling at all. I called the reception to get a person to check this and I got a maintenance guy, the guy mentioned on some setting and I changed it accordingly but the setting kept going back to default after sometime which made the room so heated up and not comfortable at all. We go to a hotel to relax and enjoy. But how could a person relax and enjoy when the room is freaking heated up? I had to wake up almost 5 times in the night to change the settings of the AC

Point 3: The food, again I won't be too picky cause in my opinion it wasn't the best. Only the breakfast (on 15th) was up to our expectation. 

In case anyone from the hotel is reading my comments, please refer to the feedback I provided. The guy at the reception read it and still didn't want to apologies or comment anything about it. 

In my opinion, the hotel was not up to my expectations. I don't think I would want to visit this hotel again for sometime and will not recommend this hotel to my friends/office (for annual trips)

Sorry about my comments above, but had to tell my honest opinion.

We booked the panoramic suite at $180 US.   On first entering the hotel, the views were very attractive.   However, that’s where the panorama ends.  None of the rooms in this hotel have views of anything once you are in the room.   You would not know you were at the beach.  The rooms are dark.  This is because of the fault in the architectural design of this hotel.  It is built on the smallest block of land compared to the expansive grounds of all the neighbouring hotels.  We paid the extra $50 per night for the ocean views, but felt really cheated, as it did not deliver.
Twice we had to call reception as the electricity in our room cut out, and once the hot water cut out.
In the middle of one night, part of the ceiling above the shower fell and woke us up. 
The staff are very friendly but not very efficient in the dining area.  When food or drink ran out at breakfast they had to be asked to refill things. 
In our experience it is a family hotel, lots of children, not a couples hotel.  The rooms were kept clean.
We would not recommend this hotel because it is false advertising to say “ panoramic views”.  There are no views at all from inside the rooms, and when we compared the prices with a number of other hotels there, it is expensive.
At $180  per night it is expensive in comparison to many beach hotels in the world of this standard.","Very bad value for money","2019-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r711121245-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

We quote for your reference the last review posted before yours : “well received with smile, and very warm welcome from main gate to room. service excellent from security guidance, reception, restaurant staff and pool boys. Good food, variety of food to select, and very friendly staff.”

With regard to your comment on the strict rules on the pool, we were not able to let your wife get into the pool with cotton clothing due to reasons of hygiene. This would be the standard swimming pool regulation regardless of which hotel you visit.

Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa being a themed property, the customers visit the resort for primarily to get the themed experience. For someone who spends a night with a focus primarily set on ‘food’ it could be a mere ‘pool and beach’.

Looking forward to welcoming you back soon.

This is my first negative feedback for a hotel.

Stayed at one of the panoromic suites in the hotel, but it does not have the view even which is available for normal rooms. Only 2 panaromic suites have a good sea view out of the 4 panaromic suites availble in the hotel.

Foods are not delicious and no lot of choices in the buffet with compared to other hotels in the same grade. It is the worst buffet ever seen in a hotel. Have to go to the buffet at the very beginning of it. Otherwise when a station in the buffet is empty, the hotel staff does not worry to fill them up.(Stayed FB-same in all 3 buffets)

The staff seems to have less experince with regard to handling guests though most of them are very friendly and helpful. 

Strict rules on swimming pool, no access to swimming pool without a nylon swimming kit. 

Nothing to see at hotel premises, just rooms + the swimming pool + beach.

The same beach is shared by lot of hotels just near malu malu resort such as anataya resort ,ugabay. Therefore If u want to visit passikuda, my opinion is to select uga bay or anantaya resort. Amaya beach & amethyst resort are also good choices. 

It is honestly a WASTE to spend ur money and time to visit this hotel because what you will experience in real is not what u see in photos in internet. 

Wanted to explain their deficiencies to the manager and the supervisors though they are at least not willing to listen and accept that they have some areas to get corrected. Instead, they boast malu malu as the best hotel in passikuda. My request to the hotel staff is at least have a visit for buffets in other hotels and learn if u have not seen what a proper buffet is.","Not recommended.","2019-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r705522717-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

Regarding your remark that the hotel is in the 80’s, it is such a pity that the concept of a “theme hotel” has escaped your attention while making the reservation. The theme of the hotel being a typical local fishing village, the hotel and the rooms are designed accordingly, which makes it unique among other hotels.
Your booking was made on “room only” basis at the rate of 300 USD therefore meals were not included. August being the peak month for the east coast, the price was due to the high demand for the hotel and it should be mentioned that the hotel was occupied 100% during your stay.
 
We strongly deny your allegation that the manager “got mad at you” which was clearly a misunderstanding on your end. Upon your complaint that the hot water was not available in the room, the manager asked whether you called the reception to inform that there was a problem with hot water, which you misunderstood as being rude. 
We never serve our clients “juice from the supermarket carton”, all beverages served are freshly made. And there weren’t any local guests in the pool who were fully clothed. The hotel staff is very strict with the swimming pool policy and would never allow guests to use the pool without swimwear. We did offer you a dinner as a gesture of goodwill, and you mentioned that you were happy.

While apologizing for the malfunctioning of the hot water in the room, we politely deny all of your other accusations. We believe this review was merely based on your displeasure at not being able to fulfill your intention of getting a refund despite being treated so well by our staff. We hope that when making future bookings at hotels, you will make sure that the price paid includes meals, and the concept of the hotel you book is well-aligned with your taste.

Once again, thank you for your kind and valuable feedback and we look forward to your return.

Ayubowan..!

I booked via booking, nice photos, ok reviews, 300 usd.. so it must be good.
Well.. it was in the 80’s. Now it is really outdated, very basic rooms, with open bathrooms so you hear your neighbours shower and €&@ wich gave a really uncomfortable feeling.
The food is..... horrible! Wifi sucks and we had cold water. 
The manager told me i had to call for hot water (if you pay this amount you shouldnt have to call for anything) and the wifi didnt work because of the rain.
And.. he got really mad at me and said “well everybody likes it” 
What a way to treat guests! 
In the end we got the dinner for free, a nice gesture, but it was absolutely horrible.
The next morning.. breakfast. They ran out of wafel batter already at 9.30, in a country filled with fruits, they served juice from the supermarket carton, and on top of all.. the 300usd did not cover the beakfast, we had to pay extra!!!
The pool was.. ok.. so was the beach.
Enough sunchairs.
But my kids were not allowed to jump in it. (Dangerous and noisy)  But the local guest were allowed to swim fully dressed: strange and un-hygenic. 
This was such a waste of my hard work earned dollars!

First and foremost, we appreciate your review and trying to bring your concern to our attention.
 
Please accept our sincere apologies for your disappointment during the room reservation process, and this has happened purely due to a technical error in our reservation system.
 
I would like to emphasize the fact that initially you were in negotiation for a date amendment but due to the tragic incidents took place on the 21st of April, you have requested for a full refund.

Due to travel advisories, we have received huge number of cancellations along with refunds during the same period and this was a totally unexpected situation which was beyond our control.

Despite all these facts we have managed to refund your money on the 06-May-2019 within 11 working days even though the refund process generally takes up to 14 working days. 
  
Our intentions are not to make you feel inconvenient and we take great pride in doing our best to ensure guest satisfaction at all times.
 
Once again, thank you for your kind and valuable feedback and we look forward to serve you on your next stay with us.

Thank you for posting a constructive review on TripAdvisor following your stay with us. We are happy to hear you were pleased with the hotel settings, also appreciate your feedback about the friendliness of our associates at the resort. I wish to note that we have treated your comment seriously to correct immediately which you felt was fallen sort during your stay. 

Your statement ‘I don't know why there is a manager for all he does is eat. The staff is so busy because they have to tend to him. Usually a manager motives the staff. But here, hi is just seated like some sort of a toy. He doesn't advice the staff nor does he do anything’ was exactly not a right statement as the Hotel Manager was on leave during 3rd and 4th January 2019, but stating such a comment could have made a negative impression on his Image as you have stayed at the resort during the said period.

Our hotel is famous for its unique services and high standards of hospitality. This can see from the reviews of fellow Trip Advisor users, we are truly concerned on each comment and treating with the utmost seriousness to correct, but we believe what you have experienced was an isolated incident that do not take place in otherwise.

We hope that you will give us an opportunity to welcome you back again to enjoy our hospitality which Maalu Maalu is renowned for.

Writing this review while staying at The Argyle. 
Toilet smelled horrible. When we spoke to reception, staff were rude and very blunt....told us that we can leave the hotel and get a full refund!!! This is after travelling all the way from Colombo to Hatton (150kms away). 

We booked 9 rooms...two rooms had dirty pillows and toilet carpets (see attached image). Two 500ml water bottles provided. Additional bottles were not provided...no local shops around. Extra bottles of water charged at extortionate rate...Rs500 for a bottle of 500ml....it was cheaper to get a 330 ml bottle of coke from the bar!!! I urge the management to address these issues promptly. We spoke to reception and it seemed to have fallen in deaf ears!!! 

You are better off travelling onwards to Nuwareliya to stay at a better hotel for half the price.","This is definitely not a 5 star worthy hotel...terrible service all round","2022-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612383-d15666018-r873072982-The_Argyle_Luxury_Boutique_Hotel-Hatton_Central_Province.html",

Greetings from The Argyle!

Thank you for taking time to give this feedback. We always want our guests to have a gratifying experience. This comes as a total surprise to us when we read your comments as you never seemed unhappy, except for the WiFi connection. We regret that we left you frustrated with the Wifi connection and this is well looked into now.  

Based on some of your remarks, we even wondered whether you have mistakenly reviewed some other property as we do not agree with some of your comments and here's to why;

We always make sure the toiletries are always restocked as and when guests allow us to clean the rooms. 
This is a new property and we do not have any sewage issues either and having a full house during the same period of your stay, you are the first guest to complain of it. 

With regard to meals, we have both options, cordial and real juice and you had almost finished your chicken wings by the time you mentioned it which we resolved immediately.    

While we understand we didn't meet your expectations on this visit, it is our hope you will stay with us again and experience our hotel as you should have on this visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Argyle Road Kudaoya Estate, Hatton 22000 Sri Lanka","Hatton","Sri Lanka","22000",,"Argyle Road","Kudaoya Estate","15666018","6.917437","Hatton, Central Province","80.586555","The Argyle - Luxury Boutique Hotel","1383","4.9","2","1","3","55","1323","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612383-d15666018-Reviews-The_Argyle_Luxury_Boutique_Hotel-Hatton_Central_Province.html","http://www.theargyle.lk","2019-12-26","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Try to get a ground floor room so you have direct access to the pool

- Beautiful location and setting on the sea

- Very unique design in the tents and comfortable beds (no black-out in the tents though)

- Fun and short safaris - do ask for Keith as your ranger! Jeeps are comfortable and safaris are well organised, they will do everything for you to have a good experience and understanding as much as you can about animals.

The CONS:

- Staff at the restaurant was unexperienced and our orders came everytime wrong and late. We had dietary requirements and they kept forgetting over and over. This is far from a luxury type of experience.

- Our stay was RUINED by kids shouting and jumping in the main pool all day, including during dinner or breakfast. There should be rules about the pool. We also had a pool cocoon and all we heard all day were children crying. 

- Housekeeping coming everytime when we are in the room, disturbing when. They KNOW for a fact we go on Safaris, when we eat and what we do all day - why not taking advantage of that to make yourself more discrete?

You pay about USD 1000 full board, you should get impeccable experience for that price. Not a luxury experience and not up to the standards of Ceylon Tea Trails.","Is it a Relais & Chateau?

However the service experience needs a lot of work starting with reservations (Nigel). When we enquired on how to get to the resort he suggested a private seaplane charter costing close to 3000USD when scheduled commercial flights was available. Incorrect invoices and rescinding an offer of two games drives to 1 game drive followed. No one contacted us pre arrival to help us plan our stay by suggesting activities etc (the website was thin on any kind of information other than corporate messaging). It turns out only game drives and a pathetic spa was on offer. 
Our prearranged (and pre paid) transfer from Weerawila military airport arrived 40 minutes after the plane arrived. Given that this was a military airport and we were not even allowed out of the hut that served as the terminal building this was a scary 40 minutes for us. The delay was due to the hotel giving the wrong last digit of the car number (since driver and car has to pre-registered for clearance prior to entry). 

The spa service was a nightmare - lights were too bright, bed too uncomfortable, no welcome or post treatment drink  (until I started coughing and then a bottle of water was handed to me), no towel or shower cap for a shower and a worse than average massage delivered by a Balinese (why not use locals?)
The food was good , especially the hoppers at breakfast (the honey one is fabulous!) . F&B Service staff were good considering the hotel has only been opened for 5.5 months (ie you should lower your expectations). We really enjoyed our game drive and our ranger was a biologist who answered all our questions with knowledge and enthusiasm for his craft. 
I was woken up the first morning at 8:30 by a bunch of guys planting trees outside my cocoon. What a racket! You can image there is absolutely no way I could have pulled down the blinds given that they were working out there all day (the bathroom is pretty dark) Given that only 19 cocoons were occupied out 28 I don’t understand why they could not have rescheduled the work at another time. 
Given that the resort is owned by the Dilmah people , only 4 types of tea were available at the restaurant. Unbelievable! 

The hardware cannot make up for the service which lacks initiative, empathy and heart. The management doesn’t  seem to   realise  that guests that pay >700 USD a night deserve better service and more activities. Senior management needs to visit more than once a month. Next time I will stay at Uga Chena Huts just next door.","Overpriced & underwhelming service","2018-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r561287096-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

I won’t thank you for your lack of festive goodwill and empathy for my team - at full stretch on their busiest day of the year. However, I will highlight some inconvenient truths for the sake of balance, on behalf of 100+ local performers who entertained us magnificently on New Year’s Eve (save for you) and my all-Sri Lankan hotel team. 

You chose a hotel that celebrates New Year’s Eve enthusiastically and charges accordingly. The truth is, you were aware of this and in particular, that supplements would be charged for the night, before choosing to stay here. As published on our website and advised by your travel agent, “US$125 per-person New Year’s Eve/peak season supplement (kids 5-12 @ 50%) includes everything we serve from 8pm onwards (31st)” and “…. New Years’ Eve (31st Dec) per-person supplements are charged irrespective of your participation or level of consumption and are charged to your bill automatically”. 

The truth is, upon arrival (before sitting down even!) you chose to ignore the above and to me directly, dismissed out of hand the joy of celebrating with others (to save money?).  You asked us not to charge the supplements because, you had no wish to join in. My manager explained clearly why we charge supplements and that your travel agent had already charged you in fact, he reminded you again that you were informed fairly and squarely, in advance. Justly so, my manager resisted further pressure to cancel the supplements and a table for 3 was duly reserved on your behalf. Unfortunately, you missed the free cocktails, canapés and moreover, the conviviality at the start of the evening, although you somehow arrived early for a dinner not due to be served until much later – hence perhaps, your perception of a late meal (the only one we can think of).
 
You went to bed early on New Year’s Eve due to an early morning safari booked with your driver - you asked for takeaway breakfasts before leaving the restaurant. Yes, I'm sorry to say we got your breakfasts completely wrong at 5am on New Year’s Day, for which we have apologized many times. It had somehow been wrongly assumed by one of us that you would return late morning for a full cooked breakfast, as almost all guests do after their morning excursions - alas, we provided only snacks to nibble. For the record, you were given 3 apples, 3 oranges, 3 bananas, 6 homemade preserve pastries – free snacks for 3 people – and offered a full menu breakfast upon your return to the hotel.
 
We met later that day, the latter part of lunchtime. I politely inquired whether you’d enjoyed yourselves in the morning to which you replied most vociferously, complaining about your breakfasts. Taking your complaint seriously I apologized unreservedly, as did my manager, our guest host, and a steward you'd also complained to. As a gesture of goodwill, I also waved off your entire lunch bill that day ""whatever you want from the menu"" to your apparent satisfaction – another truth you fail to mention. We tried hard and generously to make amends.

To conclude, the inconvenient truth behind your irresponsible review, stems from wrong choice of hotel and your failure to renege on agreed terms once ensconced in the hotel. This might surprise you but, all other New Year’s Eve guests thanked the team and me personally for an enjoyable night, most of which you actually missed, including a spectacular finale and firework show your son at least may have enjoyed? By coincidence, guests who spent that evening with us are still here, and as mystified as I am by the petty falsehoods behind your words. Others at the time, after the air cleared, asked, who were those people?

Because you have no substantive experience of this hotel or restaurant other than to a) arrive without a reservation and b) not accept/believe the property was fully occupied and thus unable to receive you, you have neither experience nor knowledge of it but write misleadingly as if you do. I reply in the interim, after interviewing members of my team and reviewing CCTV/audio footage.

1.	Whilst our Sri Lankan security guard speaks Sinhala and only a little English, I’m satisfied he politely and effectively communicated to you that our hotel and restaurant were exclusively occupied and that also, he’d call a senior colleague to elaborate further – which he duly did and for which you waited less than 3 minutes.
2.	Your fictitious comments about staff, patrons and noise emitting from the property are offensive and pure troublemaking, but regardless of my observation or opinion they are wholly untrue and could be nothing else. Given you did not enter nor could you see inside the property how could you possibly judge what was or wasn’t going on inside? For example, our restaurant is a long way from our closed/screened gates (app.100m) and at a different elevation to the entrance beyond which you did not progress – it can’t be seen even when our gates are fully open.
3.	I and most others who have seen the property know it is ‘...beautiful and the view spectacular’ as you say. You don't know this from first-hand experience however, neither do you have any idea of our service capability - we didn't serve you. What size this 'crowd' or nature of imagined 'nightmare' I wonder?
4.	You arrived at our property without a reservation only to become angry and aggressive at failing to gain access from an ordinary man (used to big cars) who was simply doing his job. In less than 3 minutes a senior member of the team arrived to assist, but, no sooner had he shaken your hand he too became a target for your rage and menacing threats, before he could even start to elaborate on what had been said by his colleague!
5.	You shouldn't be surprised that NONE of us think it fair that two valued members of the team felt intimidated and remain shaken today. Being bullied simply for doing ones job is sad, incomprehensible and plain inexcusable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rekawa Beach Road Rekawa Village, Rekawa, Tangalle 82200 Sri Lanka","Rekawa","Sri Lanka","82200",,"Rekawa Beach Road","Rekawa Village","1943029","6.047304","Rekawa, Netolpitiya, Tangalle, Southern Province","80.855316","Buckingham Place","1232","5","1","2","9","31","1189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2260795-d1943029-Reviews-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html","http://buckinghamplace.lk/","2017-08-06","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coming every year in Galle and Tangalle we tried for the first time this hotel

Horathapola was adequate at best, but certainly not up to the caliber of the other hotels that we stayed at in Sri Lanka.  I found Pia (the owner) to be quite cold and the service indifferent.  The food was uninspiring (we had far better meals elsewhere) and the room was uncomfortably warm.  We were led to believe that we would be provided with an escorted tour of the estate with the manager.  Instead we were led around by a worker who did not speak English.  The staff, in general, was poorly trained.  I was shocked that they did not provide mosquito nets.  As a result, my son and I received over a dozen bites each on our first evening in Sri Lanka.

Никогда в жизни не писала отзывов, но здесь не могу пройти мимо. Почти все, что пишут про отель не правда. Отель находится на горе, дойти оттуда по этой невыносимой жаре до пляжа невозможно. Брали тук-тук. До Сайлент бича пешком минут 20 по грязи и нищите. На Сайлент бич в океан войти нельзя, волны огромные. Пляж, который в 5 минутах от отеля не оборудован от слова совсем, там нет ни кафе, не лежаков, ничего, если вы привыкли отдыхать дикарями и за огромные деньги лежать на песке, то тогда да, но этот пляж очень грязный, там плавают пакеты и прочий мусор. В отеле идет стройка! Отель не достроен, его хозяин просто снимает деньги с русских, потому что-то из-за хороших отзывов все едут сюда. Да в отеле они стараются, это правда, все делают по первому зову, но этот вечный стук с 6 утра до 10 вечера, это сильно. Полчище насекомых, с которыми они почти не борятся, это ужасно, это все ползает по кроватям, спасались нашим гардексом, но на утро было «кладбище» животных во всем номере. У нас был верхний номер для молодоженов, текла постоянно крыша и конденсат капал на балконе. Брали с видом на океан, вид, действительно шикарный, жаль, что это только вид. По рекомендации вышеписавших брали завтрак ужин, есть нечего! Питались хлебом и ананасами. Потом я очень долго разговаривала с хозяином, добилась того, что на завтрак стали делать подгоревшие блины. Рис не съедобен весь, сладости еще хуже, зато есть видов 10 круассанов на завтрак. Про колбасу, сыр можете забыть в этом отеле, даже разговоры не помогли. На ужин, готовят морепродукты, но есть можно только креветки, рыба отвратительная из-за того, что она не свежая, а замороженная. Они все стараются, но готовить не умеют, хотя странно, то, что ты заказываешь по меню(платно) очень даже съедобно. Откуда отзывы про отель, потому что действительно хозяин ходит и дарит различные «подарки» то пиво бесплатно, то кокос, то мороженное. Обычно дают всем что-нибудь на их усмотрение в обед. На ужин подходит лично к гостям и тоже общается. На ужин и на завтрак все напитки платно. На завтрак писали про свежевыжатый соки, отжимают их дня 3 назад, похоже, так что пить их нельзя. Через неделю нашего пребывания научились пользоваться кофе машиной, потому что то кофе, что они пытаются варить сами, невозможно. Ходить по отелю придется очень много, хоть он и не построен, бесконечное количество лестниц, а по этой невыносимой влажности то еще удовольствие. Если ты не говоришь по-английски, делать там нечего, по-русски никто не понимает. Для нас это не проблема, но вдруг кому-то важно. Рецепшена нет, то есть, если ты вечером хочешь где-то посидеть, то это невозможно, потому что ресторан, бар, рецепшен-это все одно место, рядом же есть бассейн. Отель называется Спа, но ничего из спа, кроме массажа там нет, делает неплохо, но к ланкийцу надо записываться, потому что он приглашенный и постоянно в отеле не находится.  До дороги минут 5 пешком, ни один автубус туда не заедет! Вас заберут от автобуса на тук-туках. Охраны в отеле нет, сколько бы мы ни ходили, не видели ничего похожего на охрану, я понимаю, что нормальные ланкийцы в такую гору не полезут, но все-таки хотелось бы какой-то защиты, как в НОРМАЬНЫХ отелях. В связи с вышеперечисленным и обо всей стране сложилось соответствующее впечатление. Кстати, берите тапочки, на всех пляжах огромные камни и за счёт волн, тебя на них отбрасывает, моя подруга порезалась об него, так что будте аккуратны. Надеюсь мой отзыв поможет, чтобы русских перестали обманывать об этом «шикарном» отеле",".","2023-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r924268781-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Dear Ms. Nuwanthi,

Greetings from Aditya Resort!

Thank you for your comments.  We, at Aditya have always welcomed constructive criticism and have taken careful note of your post.

Firstly, we deeply regret the disappointment caused to you and your family by the non-fulfillment of your expectations and extend our sincere apologies in this regard.

The late arrival of towels was due to the current Covid-19 health & safety guidelines set out by the Governmental Authorities. Towels have to be issued strictly according to the guidelines given to us and this accounts for the delay.  

Further, meals served on “Full Board Bookings” are based on a set Menu and not on the full A la carte selection.  Looking into your complaint it was noted that both dinner and breakfast were consumed over 30 minutes from the time of serving,   this would have accounted for the state of the food, especially Kiribath and Pittu which is made of Millet (Kurakkan).

Once again please accept our apologies if we have not kept up to the high standard of service we have set ourselves.

Best regards,
Aditya Team

The place has always been beautiful and the rooms continue to be maintained. That however, is the only positive thing about Aditya anymore. 
The service is below par, with us having to make multiple requests to get anything as simple as towels brought to the room.
The highlight however, of the bad experience we had this weekend, was the food!! I don’t even know where to start... The set menu offered for dinner was limited to three selections. Chicken, fish or mixed seafood. The chicken was so inedible I had to spit it out and the seafood tasted mediocre. Quantity was inadequate and the only thing that tasted ok was the chocolate brownie. 
Breakfast was equally bad with the kiribath looking like dry pittu and tasting worse. 
No one from the restaurant bothered when it was brought to their attention that the food wasn’t good and over all the service was not what you would expect of a hotel that is supposed to be renowned for its service. 
Disappointing is putting mildly and it’s sad that a hotel with so much potential isn’t living up to it. We checked out a day early because continuing to stay was not even considerable.","So disappointed!","2021-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r783640239-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

While we regret that this reviewer was disappointed with the experience at Aditya, we feel compelled to refute the many misrepresentations made in this account.

Firstly, we take pride in the accuracy and authenticity of all the content on our website, including the pictures. For simple proof, they can be compared to the many traveller photos posted on this tripadvisor page.

It must be noted that the reviewer did not book with us. Their original hotel had overbooked them. When their travel agent reached out to us, we agreed to host them in one of our Shanthi Suites at short notice and a concessionary rate.  

Contrary to assertions made here, our Shanthi Suites have ample natural light and are maintained to exemplary standards. We have never hitherto received complaints of unpleasant odours. We do not light fragrance sticks in the rooms, and we certainly did not on this occasion.

Nevertheless, the guest demanded a sea view room and after another intervention by the travel agent, we upgraded them to Surya, our most luxurious suite. This dual-level room offers sweeping views of the beach and ocean. We are baffled by this strange description of ‘a field of machines and generators’.

Incidentally, our hotel does have a generator. It is sound-proofed and located away from the guest buildings. It is activated only during power failures, and none occurred during the reviewer’s stay. So once again, we are puzzled by this claim of ‘insufferable noise’.

As for the deprecating remarks made about our staff, we can only draw attention to the effusive praise they receive from the vast majority of tripadvisor commentators. We urge readers to consider the totality of opinions and ratings available here and draw their own conclusions. 

Best regards,
Aditya Resort

Greetings from Aditya Resort!

We are truly sorry that the reviewer did not stay with us but was there only for a couple of hours and decided to leave without experiencing Aditya. 
 
We always welcome constructive criticism but were rather surprised to read the comments made about the images on the website. The images do not do justice to the actual appearance of Aditya.  All our rooms, facilities and location are depicted as accurately as possible in the visuals posted on our website.
 
The comment made about the welcome drink not being served on arrival is untrue.The reviewer and partner were welcomed with frangipani garlands as we do for all our guests and offered face towels, fresh passion fruit juice was served but was declined.
 
The reviewer had reserved a Shanthi Suite which is located on the ground floor with garden view. This was booked through one of the leading Agents in the UK. As a part of the arrival experience the plunge pool is filled with fresh water on the day of arrival and it should not be interpreted as stagnant water. As an alternative, we offered another Suite but the reviewer did not show any interest in seeing the room. 

The vast majority of our guests praise our cuisine, but we regret to note that the reviewer did not like the food as much as the others.

As a leading resort in the industry we maintain our standards as per our guests requirements and Aditya leaves all our readers with these indisputable facts, and urges them to draw their own conclusions. 

Our sincere hope is that the reviewer will one day return to Aditya and experience the warmth and hospitality that we are reputed for.

Ayubowan from Aditya
 
Thank you for your review.  At the outset please allow us to apologize for not meeting your expectations.

At Aditya we serve a wide assortment of foods from different cuisines, with an emphasis on fresh Seafood. However, it has always been our policy not to serve pork on the menu. We apologize if this was an encumbrance to you.

Our Bar captain Indika is an award winning barman and our cocktails have been  very well accepted and have also won many awards and accolades at various competitions.  However, once again, we apologize that our bar did not deliver as per your expectations.

Our front office is manned 24 hours and our staff handle all guest relations issues and has been specifically complimented by many of our guests.

 At Aditya we endeavour to provide a peaceful, private and tranquil experience. Therefore we do not have any major activities at our property unless it is a festival. However, the front office has been providing and assisting our guests with information regarding activities in the area. We also arrange a variety of tours and excursions, the details of which are placed in the suite. Additionally our front office and staff are always available to answer queries or questions.
 
The beach in front of the property is always cleaned and we are investigating why this was not done when you were here.

Once again we are sorry that we did not meet your expectations. We sincerely hope that you will visit us again and give us another opportunity to serve you better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"719/1 Galle Rd, Hikkaduwa 80000 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80000",,"719/1 Galle Rd","","606377","6.094894","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.134705","Aditya Resort","984","4.8","5","7","17","73","882","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d606377-Reviews-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.aditya-resort.com","2017-04-26","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"After touring Sri Lanka for 10 days, I was super excited to arrive in Aditya. From the photos on internet, the reviews and the price per night, it looked like an extraordinary hotel.
The reviews being so enthusiastic, I imagined heaven on earth.
To begin with the list of my complaints: no pork served (meaning beef bacon and chicken sausage at breakfast), a very average pool, terrible cocktails, no activities, no guest relations, no business hub...
The beach is nice but not cleaned daily. Although beach is public in Sri Lanka, a little cleaning in front of the hotel can't harm. 
The Shanti suite advertised as huge was big but nothing impressive either. Large king size bed but uncomfortable mattress. The small tropical garden adjacent to the room is pretty and well maintained but the high walls around it make it somewhat suffocating. The large outdoor bathroom is by far the best part of the room (jacuzzi pool).
The Wi-Fi is anything but reliable.
What I liked: the service (kindness), the food, the tranquility and the decoration.The a/c was working well.
Also Aditya has its own tuk tuk & taxi service. Although the airport pick up is a rip off, tuk tuk services are priced very decently (LKR 600 to Hikka and back and LKR 1200 to Galle and back). You will not reach that price when bargaining on the street. 
I must say I am quite disappointed overall as for such a high price for SL I expected something outstanding.
I am returning to Sri Lanka in June but unfortunately not to Aditya. Price is not the question, I am simply looking for better value and better customer care.","Bland","2017-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r479213879-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your review of Aditya. We are pleased that you enjoyed the service and food, but we regret that you were not entirely satisfied with the overall experience.

In particular, we are sorry that your room and the public areas at Aditya were not up to your expectations. We accept that the design choices we have made can and should be subject to valid criticism.  However it is our strict policy to provide an honest representation of our property at all times. Our rooms, facilities and location are depicted as accurately as possible in the pictures we have posted on our website and on Tripadvisor. 

The conditions at our beach are unfortunately beyond our control and the red flags have been put up for our guests safety. The issue with the stray dogs on the beach is a recent one.  We are currently working with the authorities to keep them away without causing harm.

Thank you again for staying with us and for providing your feedback. We greatly appreciate both your praise and criticism as we constantly strive to improve ourselves.

We are sorry that you were disappointed with your experience at Aditya, and we always welcome constructive criticism. However, we have to take issue with some of your comments. We feel they grossly misrepresent the nature of our hotel, make thoughtless generalizations about our clientele, and impugn the culture of our country.

You claim that your suite was not cleaned before you occupied it, and that the plunge pool had stagnant water. We clean our suites thoroughly as soon as they are vacated by departing guests. The plunge pools are drained and scrubbed as a matter of course, and then refilled with fresh water. If the suite and pool were not to your satisfaction for any reason, you could have brought it to our attention at the time. We have no record or recollection of such a complaint.

Contrary to your assertions, the photographs of the property on our website are as accurate and authentic as possible. We have not enhanced or doctored them in any way. If there are any doubts, Tripadvisor users can easily access traveller photos and compare them with our own.

We regret that you found our interior decoration and lighting not to your liking, but that is a matter of taste. To each his/her own. It’s worth noting that an overwhelming  majority of our guests have commented very favourably and commended the Aditya style. 

Our plunge pools are intended to provide a cool, refreshing dip in the privacy of the suite on our usual sunny days and warm nights.

Our restaurant is open to the sounds and breezes coming from the sea. Again the vast majority of our guests enjoy that airy beachside ambience. They also tend to be extremely positive and complimentary about the meals we serve, as you yourself have pointed out. 

You are, however, wholly incorrect in your presumption that our food items are pre-made and stored in freezers. Nothing could be further from the truth. We do not even have a cold-room at Aditya. Only certain meats and other imported ingredients are stored in a freezer. Every dish we serve is prepared to order from the freshest produce we can source.

It is unfortunate that you have made a glib and erroneous reference to Sri Lankan ‘culture’. Whatever our other faults, the revolting behaviour you have described is certainly not the norm in this country. In our 7 years of operation, we have never observed such a phenomenon on our stretch of beach, nor have any of our guests ever reported it.

Equally ill-considered is your contention that anyone who thinks Aditya is exclusive or luxurious should have their mental stability questioned. We have only 12 rooms. Each is an individually decorated suite with a minimum of 750 sq. ft. of space. Each has a private plunge pool, a private garden view or an expansive balcony with a sea view. We are a Tripadvisor 2013 Traveler’s Choice Winner in the Luxury, Best Service, and Small Hotel categories.

There's certainly far more impressive boutique hotels on Sri Lanka. I am so pleased that I could only get a 2 night stay. I had originally planned to stay a week. Thank heavens that didn't happen.

I think what really bugs me is the way the owner of this hotel describes it as 'exclusive and luxurious' - clearly he's never been to such places, if he had he'd realise he's got a long way to go before joining the upper ranks of boutique hospitality. This hotel, built in 2006, somehow manages to feel like something from the 1970's which could feature in a British sitcom supposedly filmed in Spain. The awful TV show Duty Free comes to mind.

What is very clear to me is that most people come to Sri Lanka and do a tour of the country - all inland - and their final day or two is spent by the beach. And after travelling inland I can totally understand how a little place by the beach can seem like heaven. However, apart from Colombo, I have only stayed at small hotels on the coast and worked my way around some of the islands beaches. And I'm sorry to say the Aditya was the most disappointing - and the only one I shall completely erase from my memory.

1. Our room upon arrival hadn't been cleaned properly. The previous occupants were obviously smokers as the ashtrays were still full. And the water in the plunge pool was stangnant. So I have no idea how many previous occupants may have used it.

2. There are some attractive photos on the website of the suites, and even though we booked one of the better ones, our suite wasn't as remotely appealing as anything on the website.

3. I found the decoration of the hotel gaudy - orange and lime green should never be seen unless in a fruit bowl. And whoever thought someone would want to wake up of a morning and see a lime green wall ....

4. The lighting in our Ocean View Suite was awful. A wonderful huge room - but such  uninspiring decoration. They really should hire an interior decorator to do something amazing. The whole hotel is crying out for someone to do something incredible with it. But I very much suspect the owner has also dictated the interior design - and to be blunt - he has no flair or taste for such matters.

5. Contrary to some other reviews I liked the bathroom - nice and big - and I liked that it was open to the elements. Not sure of the point of a cold water plunge pool /Jacuzzi unless you can have a warm soak in it. Do people have cold Jacuzzis?There were even bath salts on the side for the Jacuzzi - but who puts bath salts in cold water? Anyway, as previously mentioned the water in it had not been cleaned and was stagnant, so we weren't going to use it. So that was a waste of money. The shower space in the bathroom is nice and large - but the shower head only pokes out a small way from the wall so you end up bashing your arms and elbos against the taps whilst trying to get under the water. Poor design.

6. I never did like the photos of the open restaurant, so I guess I can't complain about not liking the real thing. I thought it had all the charm of an outdoor canteen. Again, it's begging for an interior designer to do something incredible with the space. And once again, someone lacking in any taste selected the most ridiculous cutlery to ever be handled. Ugly and awkward.

7. The suite had a good hard bed (if you like hard beds) .. and I guess the hotel owner has a sense of humour considering there was a copy of the Kama Sutra on the bedside table ( I guess it makes a change from the Bible which no one reads). And he also includes a condom in the bathroom. Make of that what you will ...

8. At nearly $550 a night, definitely not worth it, and that didn't even include breakfast. I'll happily pay double that price if something is good. But this was $550 a night down the drain.

9. I'm certainly not going to knock any of the staff. They all try their best and are willing to assist. Plus, the hotel was kept clean. And thank heavens there was no piped music.

10. The pool area is small - thankfully very few people were staying here at the same time as us so the area was quiet. The hotel isn't on a great stretch of beach it reminded me of many in India - it's more like a locals beach - though that's not a complaint. All day it's deserted, then around 4 or 5pm mothers and fathers bring their children to do their ablutions .. and if you're unlucky you will come across men doing their 'toilet' duties and burying it in the sand. But that's the culture - you have to accept it. However, there are far more beautiful 'postcard perfect' beaches in Sri Lanka.

11. Many have reviewed the food, and those reviews swayed me into staying here. I thought this was going to be the Aditya's saving grace. It wasn't. The menu is far too vast. There is no chef on God's earth that can cook good Sri Lankan, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and various other dishes all to an excellent standard in one kitchen. It's impossible. The endlessly manhandled 'menus' put before you have way too many options, and your mind will create a scene from Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares where he discovers, as always, that menus this vast contain masses of pre-prepared dishes stored in freezers. And that's exactly what you get here. I ate food that I know for certain was not freshly prepared, and what was put before me had all the taste and allure of cardboard. Of course, the hotel owner will disagree and state everything is freshly made, but I know different. The menus here will excite the Nando's and Denny's customer. Junk food with a long shelf life, covered in gloopy sauces, full of additives. And it's many of these same people who will think the Aditya is an 'exclusive luxury boutique' which isn't remotely exclusive or luxurious. It's a mid-range small hotel mostly catering to the package holiday traveller, and that's why you wont find it on any websites that promote 'exclusive luxurious' properties.

If anyone truly leaves the Aditya thinking this is an exclusive luxurious hotel then I will question their mental stability or presume they are new to travel.","A Luxury Boutique Hotel For Those That Think Nando's Is Fine Dining.","2013-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r150466518-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Aditya strives to be a heaven of tranquility and relaxation providing the traveler with peace and privacy coupled with a high level of service. Galle town, on the one hand, is a World heritage site the grew out of Old Dutch fort - one of the few living forts in the world.

Hikkaduwa on the other hand is a bustling seaside resort, popular with both foreign and local tourists and has all the attractions such places usually offer,- cheaper accommodation, restaurants, bars, night spots, water sports, beach carnivals, etc. Here again the very nature of the place is not conducive to a hotel such as ours. Our location is equidistant between just a few kilometers away from these two attractions. Perhaps the advertising does not make this clear enough.

The incident reflects a mis-understanding of the terms of booking. It is hotel policy to charge for children above 04 years. Our Manager, Mr.Neomal Jinadasa conveyed this to the guest who arrived with a child of around 11 years. She said she had been informed that children were on free-of-charge basis. Mr. Jinadasa then accepted the booking out of courtesy without levying any charge for the child and the matter appeared to have been settled. 
 
The en-suite plunge pool remains an important attraction but none of our plunge pools have hot water facilities nor do we at any point claim to have this facility. Our guests enjoy the cool waters of our pools in the balmy 30 degree sunshine. Our staff has no reason to therefore ‘reluctantly admit’ to a lack of hot water in the plunge pools. All our expansive and luxurious bathrooms are well equipped with hot and cold water.

Aditya has from its inception welcomed guests seeking a ‘romantic getaway’ to take advantage of its secluded accommodation and quiet unobtrusive service  Our success in this direction has led to Aditya becoming a popular destination for weddings / honeymoons ( please see fuzzypeg08 – Jan 25, 2008 ) with special packages on offer to both local and foreign visitors.

I contacted the hotel direct and made the reservations  for an ocean view room and also told them that I would be there for my wedding anniversery.
On checking into the hotel, the duty manager (I think) Neomal was quite offhandish for no apparent reason and created a very bad first impression.
The rooms were quite nice, with the plunge pool being the main feature of the bathroom. Unfortunately we found the hot water was not working and we were shifted to another room after about three hours. The pool in the new room was also not functioning and the hotel staff  reluctantly admitted all the rooms on the floor had the same problem.
Dinner was nice but I was disappointed with the lack of any special arrangement for my anniversery despite telling them when I made the reservation.
Overall the hotel is a bit overated and overpriced for the facilities on offer and a fair amount of training is required for the front office/reception staff.

We have conducted a thorough review of your stay with us and genuinely feel you may have misunderstood what it is that we offer at The Wallawwa. 

We do not promise to be a five star hotel. We take great pride in the boutique character and peaceful ambiance of the Wallawwa and understand from reading your other reviews that our style of property simply doesn’t suit you. We are not, and neither do we claim to be, anything like the Four Seasons Hotel Group that you clearly enjoy. 

The Wallawwa is an 18th century manor house that was transformed to an 18-bedroom luxury boutique hotel just over 10 years ago, preserving the colonial style and atmosphere of the 200 year old building. As you can see from other past reviews, we have been praised many times for having a unique style and character as well as friendly, efficient staff and delicious food, both Sri Lankan and International.

We are unsure how you can state that our non-Sri Lankan food was “not even mediocre”, as you both ordered Sri Lankan food (Ceylon Spiced Prawns and Chicken Curry) for your dinner. If you could provide us with some specific feedback, that would be very helpful.

With regards to the spa, one of our Spa Therapists was on duty all day and only carried out two other treatments, so there was plenty of time for you to book your treatments had you requested. Unfortunately, the second therapist was on leave on the day of your stay, so a twin treatment wouldn’t have been possible. 

We’re sorry you felt like the road was dirty and crowded, but that does not have anything to do with the hotel. It is the same road that is used to get to our international airport just 15 minutes away, and one of the reasons we are acclaimed for our fantastic location. 

Finally, we’re not sure who had warned you about the snakes ‘in the region’, but Sri Lanka is known for its rich biodiversity and is something we are proud of. There are snakes found all over Sri Lanka, however the majority of them are non-venomous and are rarely seen. In over 10 years of operating hotels in Sri Lanka we have never (fortunately) had a problem with the local wildlife that shares their habitat with us. We’re sorry that it stopped you from swimming in the pool or walking around the property, but had you spoken to a member of staff, they would have most certainly accompanied you around our beautiful tropical garden.

We do appreciate constructive criticism and our team are always open to suggestions and feedback. However, rather than just posting a poor review online, we’d recommend that you raise any concerns you have whilst you’re at a hotel, so the team can do their best to put your mind at rest on the spot. 

Best regards,
The Wallawwa

     It is an old colonial style house that is well maintained if not luxurious. We were not happy with the delux room we paid for , so paid extra to upgrade to the largest most delux suite. It was very spacious, but not luxurious, yet did have a private plunge pool. We had travelled for more than 12 hours to get here and once we had showered and changed , went to their restaurant for dinner. The food quality was not even mediocre. If you ate Sri Lankan food it was mediocre, if not it was less than acceptable.

Thank you for your feedback on TripAdvisor. 

I am saddened to hear that you did not like our Garden Suite which has been praised by many guests in the past. However, I do understand that tastes and preferences can differ from person to person and I apologise if this room did not appeal to you.

We’ve investigated your early departure thoroughly and our Front Office member of staff on duty was informed by your husband that you planned to leave due to our hotel not being near the beach. In none of our marketing material do we claim to be near the beach and at no stage was he informed of the reasons you attribute to your early departure in your review. This meant he had no opportunity to show you other room categories and didn’t raise it with the Resident Manager at the time, as he had received no indication that you were unhappy. As soon as our Resident Manager heard that you’d chosen to leave he contacted you at your new hotel to check that everything was ok, so I think it’s unfair to say that we didn’t reach out to you since your departure, and that you’re still awaiting a phone call from us.

With regards to being charged $750 at checkout, I am afraid you may have misunderstood our payment terms. You were booked under our promotional offer “3 nights for the price of 2”. This denotes that you pay for 2 nights and stay a third night on a complimentary basis. This was the offer you have specifically requested for when inquiring through our website, and once the late check out and airport transfers would have been added, the total would have been $950.

Although our cancellation policy is to charge the total amount of the reservation, the staff accommodated your request to pay only 2 nights (and the airport pick up transfer), and you were happy with this at the time, as you state in your review. The late checkout fee together with the airport drop off transfer which was originally booked was waived off.

Despite the several very positive comments about our property and team members, we are disappointed that your experience did not meet your expectations, but feel that we have been lenient by waiving the charges for the pre-booked late check out and airport transfer, despite the losses we encountered due to your early departure. 

As the above shows, we don’t believe we’ve handled this situation in anything but a professional and understanding way and hope that both you and others reading this will see that the charges made were reasonable given the sudden decision to leave with no explanation at the time other than your desire to be near the beach.

If you have any further queries or require further clarification, please do contact me directly on henry@teardrop-hotels.com.

Warm regards,
Henry

Intention being to use this hotel as a base and somewhere to relax, close to airport and therefore not a lot of time spent in transport, as the roads are busy etc.

Picked up from airport and the driver was very pleasant. Arrived 4 am checked into a luxury garden suite. There was nothing luxury about this room or the yard like outdoor space. 
Sheets had marks on them the bathroom was like something out of a prison movie. Not to my taste. 

We decided to sleep and leave the next morning as this was not going to be a relaxing space for 3 days.

We had prepaid for 3 .5 nights, my husband spoke to the staff politely and told them it's not what we wanted and amicably suggested we would pay for 2 nights and then we would leave. The staff very helpfully arranged some transport for us and we decided to go to a different hotel which we have stayed in before. 

He paid the bill then later that day the hotel did call us to ask why we checked out, we then realised we had been charged $750 for staying in this hotel for 8 hours.

Several phone calls to them later and the overall bill being $950.  They refused to refund us any money and suggested that we could come back and stay for a free night.

I'd not ever want to step foot in this place again, staff very helpful if u want somewhere to rest your head before heading home or for 1 night on way in to Sri Lanka, that's the only reason to stay here.

We made a mistake in choosing this hotel , they charged us almost $100 per hour to stay there.

I'm still waiting for the phone call back more than a week later. 

Very disgruntled customer and the fact  that this hotel has not reached out to since terrible customer service . They must feel that they have given us a fair deal.

Thank you for your feedback via Trip Advisor. 

We’re very sorry to hear that you didn’t have an exceptional time at the Wallawwa and have looked into the comments that you’ve mentioned.

It’s great to hear that you enjoyed our lovely rooms and bathrooms, however we’re sorry that you didn’t find the private courtyard enticing. We’ve raised this concern with the estate manager who is in the process of some landscaping work to improve the courtyard in the room you were in. 

We have a relatively new and well serviced A/C unit in the room that you stayed in, so this is the first we’ve heard about it not working well. We have checked up on this already and it seems to be functioning properly, but we’re sorry if the remote had been set to the wrong setting. Strangely enough the guest staying in the same room the night before mentioned how lovely and cool the room was!

It’s a shame you didn’t try one of our options of main dishes at the restaurant. We cater to an international clientele, and aim to offer a wide variety of dishes – from the Ceylonese Red Chicken Curry to the Vegetarian Gnocchi or Rib Eye Steak. That said, we are also in the process of updating our dinner menu, but do feel that the food offered at our restaurant is some of the best in Sri Lanka, and is certainly no more expensive than similar hotels. Had you mentioned at the time, I’m sure our chef would have been happy to customize any dishes to suit your needs. We’ll also look into your feedback regarding the breakfast option and make any necessary amendments.

We are glad you enjoyed walking around our wonderful garden. Our menu card indeed mentions that some ingredients used are fresh from our garden, as well as the papaya and pineapple juice served upon arrival, which are both grown on the property.

Legally we have to have a board showing the opening times of the swimming pool. Had you mentioned that you’d have liked a swim after the 6pm ‘closing time’ the staff would happily have provided towels and sunbed cushions. The reason for this closing time is that it’s when the sun sets here in Sri Lanka, so seemed to us a sensible time to put the cushions etc away.

We’re extremely surprised about your feelings about the team, as so many reviews have mentioned that our staff – or family as we consider them – do go above and beyond their duty with a smile on their face and a never ending desire to ensure guests are happy. Having operated this hotel for over 8 years, we’ve had many same-sex couples who have come to stay and thoroughly enjoyed their time with us. We’re sorry you didn’t feel the same. 

We do hope to have you back at the Wallawwa, in order to show you the improvements we are making and so you can enjoy the wonderful experience that most of our guests have. If you would like to visit again, please contact me directly on sales@teardrop-hotels.com.

We stayed there recently and it was the last hotel of our holiday.  We were looking forward to our stay after reading the reviews. The hotel is located approximately 7 kilometres from the airport, which was ideal for an early flight. 
We were able to compare this hotel to the others we stayed in during our 16 day holiday. 
This sadly, was the most disappointing accommodation. The rooms are big and spacious and have a lovely bathroom. But that is where it ends. We had a private court yard, which was not enticing to sit in. The air conditioning was not appropriate for the room and we were uncomfortable all night, even though it was set on 18 degrees and the fan was turned up full. The AC was extremely noisy but not effective, and we did not sleep well. This made our long travel back home even more tiring, instead of being refreshed to start the journey home. 
The dinner menu was very uninteresting. We opted for 2 entrees only, as none of the mains sounded particularly appealing. We then had dessert and the resulting bill was high for what we consumed. The food was average. We were given a packed breakfast to take to the airport, and it was very poor value, given that we had a bed and breakfast booking. The sandwiches looked like they had been prepared and toasted the evening before and the bacon fat had seeped through the toasted bread. They were inedible. 
On a positive note, the grounds were lovely. We showed ourselves around and we noticed that the hotel has its own fruit and vegetable garden, which excited us. Fresh from the garden to our plates, we thought. The menu obviously did not highlight that fact. The pool hours don't work for a one night stay with an early departure the next morning. After a long, hot drive we were looking forward to a refreshing swim before dinner. Pool hours were 7am - 6pm, and we arrived around 5.30pm. Our morning pick-up was next day at 5am. None of the other hotels had these short hours. 
The staff were not very friendly or warm, which was a different experience to every other hotel we stayed at in Sri Lanka. Everywhere else the staff made you feel welcome and valued. At the Wallawwa Hotel  perhaps it was because we were a same-sex couple. The whole place lacked atmosphere and the high standard we'd expected. 
We stayed at a cheaper hotel in Negombo on our first night in Sri Lanka, which was close to the airport. We will be staying there again next visit. I can't recommend this hotel and we are sorry we stayed here on our last night.

Thank you for your feedback via Trip Advisor. 

We are, however, extremely disappointed to receive 2 out of 5 from yourself and your partner (in the other review) as it is always our intention to ensure no guest is ever dissatisfied.  If you had voiced your concerns during your stay we would be more than happy to have addressed any issues then and there. The Wallawwa has history dating back to the 18th century, with residents such as the Head Chieftain of Galle and the Royal Air Force, so although it is not comparable to ‘other newer hotels in Sri Lanka’, we offer a range of activities both in and outside the hotel for guests that want to do more than relax by our tranquil pool. 

We’re sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with the delicious vegetarian/vegan options that we provide (for example the goats cheese tart, various pastas, soups, salads, pizza, or even the Sri Lankan vegetarian Cadju Nut & Green Pea curry or Kottu Roti). As we cater for travelers coming from all parts of the world, and do not wish to offer buffet style dining, we offer an a la carte menu that covers both international cuisine and authentic local dishes. As other reviews suggest, the food offered at The Wallawwa is generally exceptionally well received, so we’re sorry to hear that you weren’t impressed with your dinner.

As I hope you saw, we have our own fruit and vegetable garden meaning much of the food that arrives on your plate has travelled no more than 100 metres. So whilst we do apologise if it was not up to your expectations, we do make every effort to ensure we use the finest and freshest ingredients possible.

As for the guests arriving/departing in the rooms next door, we apologise for any disruption caused. Though the walls are 9 inches thick (which is standard for any hotel), it is difficult for us to control a noisy neighbour and we’re extremely sorry that you were disturbed by them. 

Once again, we’re disappointed that you didn’t enjoy your time at The Wallawwa, but will take on board your comments and will look into developing the menu further (we’re actually already working on a new menu that will take effect in September). I do wish you’d raised your concerns at the time so we could try to have put things right, but hope you give us the opportunity to show the service excellence that we’ve become known for if you do return to Sri Lanka.

Thank you for choosing to stay at the Wallawwa recently. We endeavour to offer our guests the best possible experience and we are very sorry that you didn't enjoy all parts of your stay with us. The mosquito fogging is a necessary prevention in the tropics and we do inform all guests prior to this taking place but we apologise if this inconvenienced you. With regards to the feedback on your dining experience, we will take that on board and look into all your comments, in particular regarding the contents of our packed breakfast which we offer if guests are leaving before 0630hrs. It certainly should have included a drink and we are amending the offering immediately. We appreciate all feedback and hope that one day you will choose to stay with us again.

Thank you for your feedback via Trip Advisor. 

We are, however, extremely disappointed to receive the low score you have given, but are glad to see that you found everything that we provided to your satisfaction. 

That said, we’re sorry you were disturbed by other guests’ children. As you suggest, I’m afraid there’s not a huge amount we can do to control children while they are with us - and to not allow families would be unfair on the vast majority we have to stay who have very well behaved offspring. 

I’m sure, had you voiced your disapproval at the time of your stay, a member of the team would have either tried to accommodate you in a quieter area of the hotel or could have asked the children to keep the volume down.   

If you have any further feedback as to how you feel we can improve, or could have dealt with the matter at the time, please do contact me directly on henry@thewallawwa.com

We’re disappointed to read your review about The Wallawwa on Trip Advisor and are extremely keen to hear more about your stay with us so that we can aim to improve. 

In terms of the history and design of the property, we disagree that The Wallawwa is ‘fake’ in any way. The main building, now housing the public areas of the hotel, was built over 200 years ago and renovated 3 years ago at the same time that we built the bedrooms and spa. The furnishings are a combination of genuine Sri Lankan antiques as well as contemporary Asian designed and custom made furniture to ensure comfort and style. The bedrooms and suites are all air conditioned and the temperature can be controlled by the guest occupying the room. Internet access in Sri Lanka is slower than in many parts of the world and can be frustrating – an iMac is located in the study for guests’ use (free of charge) and the rooms are set up to allow wireless access to those traveling with their own laptops/iphones etc. – I apologise if there was any disruption to accessing the internet during your stay.

You say we are ‘impossibly far’ from Colombo – this is not something we can (or would like to) change. As shown on the google map on our website, we are approximately 30km from the city centre and the drive time varies depending on traffic (the journey usually takes 45-60 minutes). The property was chosen due to the proximity to the airport and main roads to many of Sri Lanka’s top tourist destinations, rather than the ease to get to and from the city. We are delighted to be part of a small village in the countryside where we live in harmony with our neighbours and the natural habitat. There is a fantastic array of wildlife in Sri Lanka and we’re pleased they choose to spend some of their time in, or passing through, our beautiful gardens. The birdsong in the morning and various rare trees around the property, in our view, are some of the things that make The Wallawwa such a tranquil and special place to relax before or after your journey.

In the 2½ years we’ve been open we’re delighted to have received so many excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and are proud to be regarded as one of the very best boutique hotels in Sri Lanka. While we try to cater to every guests' needs and tastes, and work extremely hard to ensure friendly and efficient service, it appears we fell short during your stay with us. I'd be interested to hear where you feel we didn't meet your expectations and would be very grateful if you could email me on henry@thewallawwa.com with further details so I can personally look into the feedback you have. 

Warm regards,
Henry

Thank you for your review on tripadvisor. As mentioned during our email conversation, I have investigated all aspects of your feedback and have found the following :
•	As promised in our confirmation email to you when you made your reservation, the driver was waiting for you in the arrivals hall, before you leave the airport building, with a nameboard for you. Unfortunately it seems you had walked past the nameboard and left the building and then couldn’t find the driver. Following your call to the hotel we sent the driver to look for you and I understand he found you within ten minutes. 
•	Also mentioned in our confirmation details to you, breakfast is included/is complimentary. If guests leave the hotel early to catch a flight and don’t want to sit and have breakfast then we offer a pack breakfast to take with them.
•	Our confirmation voucher to you clearly states that the rate of US$180 for a Garden Suite is ++. The total amount is shown on this voucher. This amounts to 24.2% service charge and government taxes. We are legally obliged to charge this percentage and the breakdown is as follows: 10% service charge, 12% VAT (added on top of the total amount including service charge) and 1% Tourism Development Levy. It is standard practice in Sri Lanka to show this as ++ and we state this on all of our correspondence and on our menus. 
•	Airport transfer charges are higher than other transfers due to the fact that we need to pay for parking in the airport car park and, during pick-ups, the driver needs to pay a fee to come and wait inside the arrivals hall for you (unfortunately you had missed him on your way outside).

Other than your issues with the rates that we charge and the government taxes, I’m delighted that you found the bedroom, shower room and bed all fantastic.
Warm regards,
Henry

the manager from the hotel said we could take a cab and redeem the fare. but it s shown on the bill that we still needed to pay it when we checked out. after complaint, they cancelled this item --- but looks like i was almost cheated. 

i requested  i didn't need the breakfast but they weren't responding positively insisting it s included , though they gave in at the end after my couple of times of request. 

worst of all, there is this 24% VAT upon the $180 suite and 2300 rupee taxi fee.
what s that ?? i stayed in colombo and kandy for 5 nights in different 4/5 star hotels including galle face regency and hilton, and never got this quirky item !!! i mean if you are charging something that other hotels don't normally do, you shoud have mentioned it up front before my room booking!

i took 50 minutes one way taxi from airport to colombo costing 2600 rupees; 4 hours private taxi from the hotel to negombo and took 25mins transport each way, and it costs me a total of only $3500 rupees WITHOUT any 24%VAT , v.s. the transfer arranged by the hotel from their place to the airport taking 15 mins only BUT they charge me 2300 rupees PLUS 24% VAT , summing up to 2852 rupees !!  U DO THE CALCULATION YOURSELF!  there s VAT on taxi booked from your hotel ?  what a scam?

air conditioner is very noisy in room 8. 

other than that , the bedroom , the huge shower room, and the comfortable honeymoon bed has been a fantastic experience.

Thank you for spending the time to review The Wallawwa. 
We are, naturally, disappointed with much of what you say and would like to apologise for any shortcomings there may have been during your stay. We have already made improvements to the hotel, thanks to your feedback, as follows : 
1)	A hairdryer is being placed in every room. 
2)	Yours was the first time we had heard from a guest that they could hear the generator from their room. We have since decided to build another wall and plant more vegetation around the generator so it can no longer be heard from the bedrooms. The use of the generator is infrequent (basically only used during emergencies) but was crucial during your stay due to low power supply from the CEB.
3)	We are reviewing our menu options for vegetarians and in addition to our daily dinner menu, which currently offers a minimum of two vegetarian starters and main courses, we are going to launch a special vegetarian menu on request basis from 1 Feb 2010. 
4)	As we discussed during your first stay, it is difficult to ensure a curry has the “right” amount of spice for each guest (everyone has a different opinion as to what is spicy or not) and we’re working on several dishes that can be interchanged depending on whether a guest asks for their curry hot, medium or mild.
5)	We apologise for the errors made during the dinner on your final evening. The waiter serving you was new to the team and we are working on his English skills and his understanding of guest’s requirements. As you know, we didn’t charge for any of the dinner and will learn from the experience to ensure this will not happen again. 
As you can see from many other reviews on tripadvisor, our staff at the hotel and the hotel management take a great deal of pride in ensuring every guest enjoys their time at The Wallawwa and the feedback in our first year has been exceptional. We very much hope you will return to Sri Lanka again and give us the opportunity to show you that we have taken on board your feedback and corrected any flaws that you felt there were.

The building itself is very nice and the rooms are nicely decorated with big bathrooms.  Small items are missing - no hairdryer for the ladies.  

The hotel is very isolated so there is no going anywhere else for a drink or to eat.

The first time we stayed we were charmed and looked after by one of the assistant Managers who used to work for Tea Trails - he appeared to carry the rest of the team.

The rooms are noisy and difficult to get sleep in if the generator is running as it is situated right next to the rooms - this happened on our second night when my husband did not sleep at all.

The food is a problem for vegetarians - there is little choice and despite us asking nicely for them to accommodate us we had great difficulties.  We ate for the first two nights but despite being the only two guests eating on the second night our request for a spicy Sri Lankan curry - hardly a difficult request was not honoured.  Surprisingly we could get a spicier breakfast than we could evening meal.  The breakfasts - we had two - were very good indeed the egg hoppers and fruit were lovely.

Our return visit was a disaster.  The hotel appeared to be virtually full - we gave our dinner order - but the waiter obviously got it wrong - our cashew nuts to nibble with our apperitif arrived with the vegetables for our main meal - which we politely sent back.  Then only one starter arrived - we didn't make a fuss but said there were two - then my husband's main meal arrived at the same time as the second starter - we ate the starter and waited and waited for the second main meal which did not arrive when we asked where it was we were told the waiter didn't speak good english and didn't understand my order so hadn't put one in!  They then took away my husband's now cold meal and came and asked if we wanted dessert!  We pointed out we'd patiently watched the other guests eat - eaten our starters been given our wine and they appeared to have cancelled our main meals without asking us - we asked them if they were cooking them and were told they weren't prepared to discuss that with us we would have to wait and speak to a manager.  We checked out at this stage - our last evening in Sri Lanka ruined - the front of house manager did eventually appear at the same time as our taxi and said he was sorry the waiter didn't speak good english - we said ok - but we spoke to another waiter and all we'd wanted was our food for them to just decide to cancel the order without telling us so we couldn't eat was bad.  The Hotel Manager saw all of this happen and strolled past us with distain and did not attempt to try to help or sort the matter out.

I think the main problem at this hotel is the management - pity it could be nice - but it isn't.

The loungers around the pool are dirty and aren't cleaned and kept nice as in other hotels either.

Thank you for choosing Cinnamon Life for your birthday celebration and for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

While we’re pleased to know that you enjoyed the culinary offerings and ambience, we understand from your note that certain aspects of your experience fell short of the warm hospitality you expected—and rightly deserve. Your observations regarding the attentiveness and spirit of service you encountered are taken very seriously, and we appreciate the care with which you’ve shared them.

We understand how meaningful a birthday celebration is, particularly when shared with loved ones and little ones, and we’re truly grateful that you entrusted us with such a special occasion. Your feedback highlights areas where we must strive harder to ensure our guests not only enjoy exceptional food and surroundings, but feel genuinely welcomed and well cared for throughout.

While it’s heartening to know that your previous visits to other Cinnamon properties have been memorable, we hope to have another opportunity to create an equally lasting and joyful experience for you at Cinnamon Life. Should you choose to return, we’d be delighted to welcome you once again and ensure your time with us reflects the spirit of gracious hospitality we are truly committed to.

Unfortunately, the only plus was the food. The service was unexpectedly and very surprisingly terrible with no exaggeration. 

As we went with our two kids one being 3 months, we requested that we would have an extra chair so to place the baby carrier on. But, as we went there we soon realised that the chair available was not big enough, so we requested to be seated at a table that was adjoining a ledge which we could have placed the baby carrier comfortably, however the main steward denied our request citing that it was reserved, then we requested another chair stating that the one chair wasn't enough, to which the main steward seemed visibly irritated and retorted to a subordinate server to ""see if there were any extra chairs available"" (the restaurant wasn't crowded and there were plenty of chairs available), they did however manage to find us a chair in the end. The other table we requested to be seated at remained available for the 3hrs we remained there! Afterwhich, my husband and 7 years old daughter requested a surprise b'day cake, which after hesitation the management agreed but just merely placed it haphazardly on our table and left, where as other five star hotels have kindly shared in the celebrations and have even sung a ""happy b'day"" song.  After dinner we decided to have a cup of coffee, as my husband stood for his turn at the coffee station another main steward there said he would send the coffee to our table, afte about 15 mins we realized that it wasn't coming so we re-requested it from another steward, and received the cup of coffee. 
Towards the end of the night the staff seemed visibly hurried and the same senior steward ""accidentally"" brushed my head as I was seated as he passed by! 

The ambience and the food was however great but as for myself and my family what we appreciate best is the hospitality of those serving us. Unfortunately, the ""spirit"" at life was quite glum and we seemed to be more of a bother than welcomed. It must be said that we've been at Cinnamon Grand, Lakeside, and Bey and the service has always been excellent. Therefore, we're not quite sure what's going on at Life, perhaps an ""off"" day 🤷‍♀️","Unexpectedly Disappointed","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d29019029-r1002810176-Cinnamon_Life_City_of_Dreams-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

With a $1.5 billion price tag attached to the project, we were expecting a top-notch experience. What we got, however, was a mix of dim lighting, smudged plates, and a hospitality team that seemed allergic to genuine warmth.  

Let’s start with parking. Imagine driving in endless spirals inside the building, guided by a small army of staff waving us along. The lighting, triggered by sensors, gave off a vibe more suited to a horror movie than a luxury establishment. A bit of modern traffic management tech wouldn’t hurt, especially given the ""dream"" budget they’ve been boasting about.  

Next came the restaurant floor. The lift ride up felt more like a trip to a mid-tier office than the entryway to a grand culinary experience. The staff stationed in the corridors stared at us like we’d crash-landed from another planet—awkward, to say the least. Hospitality seemed to have taken the evening off.  

Before dinner, a quick stop at the washroom proved…uninspiring. It had all the charm of a public restroom you’d find in an old building. Definitely not what you’d expect in a place aiming for luxury status.  

We dined at Indiya, a restaurant with a name that promised vibrant flavors. The setting, however, was underwhelming. Overlooking the sea and street, the space felt cramped, with dirty columns, visible litter under the table, and flickering wall lights that seemed to be auditioning for a haunted house.  

The food experience started with plates that came pre-decorated—unfortunately, with smudges and fingerprints. To the waiter’s credit, he promptly apologized and replaced them, explaining that they were cleaned with hot water. Noted. The mutton curry we ordered was tasty but turned cold before we got to the last bites. A warming tray or hot gel plate might’ve saved the day.  

Throughout dinner, the staff maintained a distant politeness that bordered on robotic. They smiled, sure, but with a coldness that felt anything but welcoming. One staff member stood out with a friendly demeanor—perhaps a rare gem in this setting—but the overall vibe was far from the ""dream"" experience we were sold.  

When we left the restaurant, the lack of hospitality continued. Staff in the corridors and at the entrance seemed preoccupied, hands in pockets, chatting amongst themselves, and ignoring passing guests. Only the reception desk staff managed to crack a smile as we exited.  

The menu options were limited, the pricing ambitious, and the overall experience lackluster. For a place named ""City of Dreams,"" it felt more like a hasty experiment. While the location and investment suggest potential, the execution falls miles short.  

Until some major changes are made, we won’t be returning. For now, the dream feels more like a missed opportunity.","Cinnamon Life - City of Dreams: A Reality Check","2025-01","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d29019029-r987769748-Cinnamon_Life_City_of_Dreams-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We had the lunch buffet at 1 pm in Quizine on the 9th floor. A beautiful restaurant but unfortunately that was as good as it got. The lunch buffet at a cost of 5800Lkr per person plus service charge was absolutely dreadful. The supposedly hot food was cold and I thought it was rather bland in taste. I didn’t have too much as I was saving myself for the spread of Sri Lankan food. I filled my plate with black chicken curry, aubergine, lotus root curry, roasted garlic and rice. I was so looking forward to eating Sri Lankan food in this top rated hotel. I am struggling to find the words to describe how dreadful the food was. To say it was tasteless is an understatement. It was like eating food that had been boiled in water and just coloured with dye. It was stone cold and disgusting, a real let down. I was expecting good food but wow was it disappointing. 
A waiter came and asked us how we were enjoying the food, I asked him have you eaten here and what did he think of the food? He replied “yes I have and it’s not very good”.  For me that was conclusive evidence how awful the food in this place really is. 
With one soft drink each the bill was over 32000Lkr, that’s roughly £80, a complete waste of money. A few days before I had chicken kotthu roti in Galle for £3 and that was amazing. 
Give this place a miss and don’t waste your money, eat in small local restaurants for a fraction of the price.","Terrible experience at City of Dreams","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d29019029-r979790535-Cinnamon_Life_City_of_Dreams-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you very much for choosing Jaffna Heritage on your recent stay in Jaffna and for taking a time to provide a feedback for us.

On a positive note, we’re pleased to hear that you are happy with the room cleanliness, location and Front office staff service.

On the other hand, I believe that you have done a research in choosing a hotel. You can see it from all photos we posted in here as well as in our website or any other social media channels. All of our photos are original and most of our guests shared that the pictures also justify the real product. They all love the ambiance within the Jaffna Heritage Hotel. 
Regarding the room that you have booked double room not the triple room, I’d like to share that all double rooms are having similar size and no individual balcony in any double room, except the Triple. Please note that our Hotel is boutique category Hotel which our team already explained to you during your stay. 
We notice the inconvenience you felt for the rate of our rooms. The price has decided according to product cost in srilanka and we understand that what is suitable for some is unsuitable for others.
 Regarding the Food experience, it such unfortunate that our Jaffna authentic breakfast concepts did not meet your expectations,  even though we are not specialized in Indian Food, we provide some Indian cuisine at our outmost best  in our breakfast rotation and they have been highly appreciated by our guests, including our guest from India , I truly understand that people have a different expectation, and I am sorry to hear that we are unable to meet yours at this occasion. The feedback about the food warmer highly appreciated and it has already been addressed to our Culinary team for further improvement.
We’re sorry to hear that your stay experience wasn’t quite up to your satisfaction. Rest assured that I’ve taken note each point you raised and will discuss it further with our team to find the best ways to improve our products and services. 

Thank you.

1. I and my wife stayed at this hotel for two nights (07 to 09 Dec 2024).
 
2. I had booked this hotel through Ms CEYLO TRAVELS,COLOMBO as part of our 14 Nights 15 Days itinerary. ""My decision to utilise the services proved to be a big mistake and in fact a disaster.""

3. I was apprised by Ceylo Travels that it is a 4-star Heritage property and  it is a pure vegetarian and Alcohol free hotel which was not a big/significant issue in view of my personal habits of drinking and eating.

4. Good Points.
   
   a. The hotel Front Office (FO) is quite positive, responsive and cooperative.
   
   b. The room was quite clean and tidy.
   
   c. The hotel is located only 600 Metres away from the famous Nallur Kandaswamy t. 
   temple, although it did NOT matter that much to us since we had dedicated Cab 
   hired for the entire trip.

   d. The hotel does have a mini swimming pool in front of the FO.

5. Bad Points/Detailed Description.
 
  a. By no standards, this hotel qualifies to be graded as 4-Star or even a proper 3-Star. It is equivalent of a mid segment economy lodge hotel in India.

   b. A similar room with same amenities would cost only Rs 3,000/- to 3,500/- INDIAN 
   Rupees anywhere in India. I state this with full conviction and sense of 
   responsibility.

   c.  The hotel does not have a proper Lobby/seating area  near its Front Office of a 4- 
   Star hotel.

   d.   The photo given in the profile on website is misleading since it is that of a family 
   room of 3 beds located on ground floor. The normal 2 person room allotted to us was 
   on the first floor which was. smaller and it did not have a balcony like the Ground 
   Floor rooms.

  e.  The standard of toiletaries (shampoo ,conditioner and body gel) was poor and 
  substandard.

 6. Food.

 a. The standard of food in terms of variety and quality is VERY POOR and is in fact awful.

 b. One has to choose from a menu with little or NO worthwhile choice. I am attaching the image of the dinner manu for both nights.

c.  The breakfast was served as buffet on both days and the variety and standard is very poor.

d. The basic amenity like FOOD WARMERS for keeping served food WARM was not there. (Photo attached).

7. Feedback Form. The FO produced an Old Visitor Book when I asked for feedback form to render a meaningful feedback which could be utilised by the management for the improvement in future.

8. Summary.

   A. This ""so called heritage"" hotel is at best  3-star standard and is highly overrated in the reviews. I assume the visitors don't have patience and inclination to write a thorough, realistic and comprehensive review.
   
B.  I would also conclude  that I had made a huge mistake by booking my 14 nights tour to Sri Lanka through Ms CEYLO TRAVELS,COLOMBO. This company is into excessive profiteering and is making a fool of the Foreigner Customers like us after taking 10% advance before reaching Sri Lanka and collecting balance 90% in CASH (USD or INR) immediately on arrival at Colombo.

   C. I would therefore suggest that the Foreigners especially Indians MUST not use the services of this company which is looting its customers in a systematic and organised manner ,knowing fully well that it will be very difficult and highly un-economical for a foreigner to sue them on the Sri Lankan soil.

The room didn't have a tap and there was only a shower. Since washing clothes was difficult the guy at the desk helped us solve that problem. He also had first aid ready when my kids hurt themselves in the pool( which had broken tiles).

The food is pathetic and is overcharged for the quality. The first night we were served a dish that was spoilt. The chef tried to convince me that it was a Srilankan preparation. Having been gastronomic that was an insult. The quantities were very meagre. 

The next day for breakfast we were given puri and an aloo gravy, nothing else. The hot water they served for black coffee had sediments in it. The coffee was instant and lacked flavour too. The fact that we had a choice between continental and oriental wasn't explicitly told. We are used to having a combination of both. And since we had both they charged us for it.

I went out to the reception area where the security guard dialled the number for the manager. The manager explained that there was no hot water because of a fault in the solar heating and that it would be back on the next afternoon. 
The manager seemed unable to comprehend that not having a hot shower for 24 hours in a country as hot and humid as Sri Lanka is something completely unacceptable for someone from the UK and kept repeating that hot water would be available the next afternoon. I asked for him to find another room in the main building. After 15 mins I phoned him again and he said he was still trying to find a room. This is a small hotel and it shouldn't have been that difficult. It was now 7pm and we were desperate for a shower and dinner so I found another hotel available and we decided to check out.

I could forgive the less that clean room, as a resident of Sri Lanka, this is becoming a recurrent theme and the lack of international TV channels ,I know, people don't go on holiday to watch TV, but it would be nice to have the choice, especially as you are paying for amenities that you can't use.

Later on the manager was again extremely rude telling me that I had to move out of the reception area as he had a big group of tourists coming and he needed the reception area for them and I couldn't sit there, even though I was a guest at the hotel, he then proceeded to check on us every couple of minutes. To be fair he did try and help briefly but this was completely undermined by his rude attitude and total lack of patience. His whole approach was more that guests should accommodate him, so he could do his job, rather than being a helpful host. Sri Lanka is a beautiful place but it's not easy to get around or work out the best places for food, accommodation etc therefor of course visitors to Sri Lanka might need guidance, not a door in the face and being told where you can and can't sit!!!!

Though it made for trying reading, I thank you for the trouble you’ve taken to write the review you have.   As an owner of Ulpotha, my first reaction upon seeing your name was regret that you did not bring any of your issues to my attention.  I remember meeting you and chatting with you and taking away a most favourable impression.  It’s a shame you gave up on Ulpotha after less that 36 hours of being there (and sorry to hear that you felt you were intruding on us by being in the house, when I can assure that it’s nothing other than a pleasure to share it with our guests).

Secondly, in the context of your comment about Conde Nast, I would like to bring to your attention the most recent Ulpotha press coverage, written for The Huffington Post by a journalist who visited Ulpotha after your stay: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karin-badt/yoga-retreat-sri-lankan-jungle_b_2400352.html.  I hope this can put to rest the notion that we are ‘resting on [our] yoga mats’ or being complacent and indicate instead that your unfortunate experience appears very much the exception to the rule.  It might also be interesting to know we do not have anyone carrying out PR for Ulpotha - the press coverage we get comes our way simply because people have heard about it and want to write about it.

I am afraid your review is too long and too detailed – and in some places a little too personal – to go into point by point.  However I will deal with what I see as over-arching issues relating to Ulpotha and your experience:  the cost of staying at Ulpotha, the length and timing of your stay and the management and ethos of Ulpotha.

With regards to the costs, I am afraid it is misleading to cite a room rate, as we do not charge such a rate.  Instead we use a per-person per-day rate and this works out to $192.85.  I would like to point out that this includes taxes, all meals, snacks, drinks, two yoga classes a day, a full day excursion per week’s stay, a one hour massage per week’s stay and the use of the sauna, steam bath and hot water bathing area - and of course accommodation.  

It’s worth mentioning, when talking about costs, that the monies paid by visiting guests during the six months Ulpotha is open goes towards running the village and supporting the villagers in and around Ulpotha, including a free Ayurveda clinic, for the entire year (the clinic has treated over 9,000 patients and has had over 30,000 visits).  Ulpotha is not a profit-seeking venture; it is instead an exercise in co-operative, cross-cultural living through sharing of resources.  

There is a good reason why we maintain a minimum stay of one week but recommend two.  Ulpotha is a place that some connect with instantly while others can take longer.  But, by and large, more or less everyone gets it within three days.  Once gotten, the experience is generally a special one.  In your case, it is regrettable that you left as soon as you did, especially in light of the fact you arrived in the middle of the second week of the stay of the majority of the other guests there at the time.  What might have felt at first blush as cliquiness was more to do with the fact that everyone else had come to know each other more than you felt you knew them. As for their conversation, I suppose conversations, however humorous, deep or enchanting they might end up becoming, have to politely start somewhere.  

I was around when I saw you bid farewell to the other guests, who I thought responded to you with an inclusive friendliness (though it didn’t click with me at the time that you were leaving early and disappointed).  I think you’d agree with me that there was a lot of laughter, banter and a general sense of happiness among those guests.  It’s unfortunate that, though you were sharing the same setting, the same care and hospitality, the same accommodation, the same company and the same weather conditions, the results were so different.  

Coming to the weather, what can I say?  I am awfully sorry it was so wet and damp.  In all honesty extended periods of bad weather can play havoc in a place like Ulpotha, designed as it is to be open and one with nature.  Having said that, it is worth pointing out that the rain was exceptional in its persistence - such weather has not been experienced in ages - resulting in a national crisis involving 46 deaths and 300,000 people left homeless (the floods in some areas were worse than the last bad ones in 1957 and the reason why you couldn’t come directly to Ulpotha).  It might be a small consolation and scarcely believable to you, but Ulpotha does happen to be located in Sri Lanka’s Dry Zone.   

You’re right about Ulpotha not being run as a hotel.  It is a naturally beautiful place that is available to be shared with the wonderful people who happen to live there and who effectively are all our hosts.  They are neither ‘staff,’ nor are they ‘practically free’ as you suggest.  Ulpotha is in fact run and managed by a committee of villagers and they strive to do the best they can – and their best is quite exceptional in a unique way.  Their approach is driven by generosity and gracious hospitality.  This is why there is no tipping in Ulpotha.  It would be out of place and its absence is an indication that money is not the focal point here.

As for Suzi, who so kindly helps us out by being the bridge between the villagers and our guests on a day-to-day basis, she is by wide acclaim attentive, caring and gracious to a fault.  Again, as with Ulpotha in general, I am afraid I have to conclude that yours has been a puzzlingly exceptional and unfortunate experience.  

Finally, thank you for the nice things you did have to say – about the food, the scenery, the varied and beautiful fauna and flora and the visiting therapists.  Thank you too for the point about the torches - we had avoided having our own due to the problem of battery disposal.  However, since we can get around this by having wind-up ones, we will have a stock of these handy to lend to those who don’t bring their own as recommended.  

I wish you better luck when you next go on holiday and all the best in 2013,

We'd read the rave reviews about Ulpotha in Condé Nast and various ""best yoga retreat"" books.
But I'm afraid they must have been written a long time ago.  Perhaps when there was someone competent running the place.

Don't get me wrong: if you were spending $50 per night, Ulpotha would be a lovely, simple, no-frills yoga retreat experience in a charming location.
The trouble is, they charge over $400 per room per night - the sort of rate where you expect, er, a little more.  Especially in Asia where staff are practically free.

We were picked up from Colombo 10 hours later than agreed, because there had been flooding on the roads.  We drove four hours honking our way through slow traffic in a clapped-out minibus, with ants crawling around the floor and a driver who spoke no English.  (The transfer was $120 extra, of course.)

We arrived in the dark, walked down a muddy, rain-sodden path, and were met by S., a rather spaced-out lady who ""runs"" Ulpotha.  
But no, she doesn't really ""run"" anything.  She's the sister of one of the owners, and she treats Ulpotha as her private holiday retreat.  The guests are frankly a bit of a nuisance.  She lives in Paris half the year, and Ulpotha the other half.  And Paris seems to have rubbed off on her.  So whenever a guest asks her something, she sighs and shrugs and comes up with a reason why that's not possible.  Then, when pressed, says, ""well, I suppose I can see if I can arrange something"".  
She took us to our hut.  About a quarter of a mile along dark muddy paths with confusing turns.  No, there's no loo in the hut - you have to find your way back along the dark path about 100 yards, turn left at the bush and right after the tree, and you'll reach a basic loo with only cold water and a piece of pink soap the size of a broad bean.  Or turn left at the tree and round the corner to have a cold shower by a rock.  Just try not to tread on a snake or a bee or a scorpion.  ""You did bring torches didn't you?"" (don't be silly, at a mere $400 per night, Ulpotha couldn't possibly provide torches...)

S. showed us our room.  Made of mud and thatch, it's open to the elements - charming on a warm day, but less so in driving rain, and with no doors or windows, there's certainly no privacy.
You get a couple of oil lamps that stink of, er, oil. A cupboard, also made of mud - a nest of insects was busy creating a new home in mine... ""Be careful"", S., says, ""the ants might eat your clothes.""  Thank you.  There are some cheap incense sticks that smell of Glade, to take away the smell of the oil lamps.  The sounds of the jungle are lovely, but there isn't a view at all - or anywhere to sit and write, for example.  Just two beds and a couple of cushions looking out at a damp bush.  Extra damp because in the middle of the night, there's no way any guests are going to go 200 yards down wet, muddy, dark paths in search of the loo - no, of course we all pee in the nearest tree and hope a snake doesn't take a swipe at our private parts.

Don't get me wrong: I quite enjoy a no-frills holiday.  I worked in the rainforest for months at a time, living in very similar basic conditions.  The difference was, I was paying nothing there.  Ulpotha charge more than the Taj...

I won't bore you with every last detail. 
But to summarise:
The good things:
- The food is vegetarian and local and tasty (though it's basically the same every day: perhaps find a more interesting pudding than a slice of pineapple once in a while?)
- The area is beautiful: a large man-made lake, surrounded by rocky hills, from which, when you climb up them, you can see for miles of untouched landscape.  But sadly none of the huts look at the lake.  (Except one, that you can row out to.  We later learned that it's possible to spend a night there.  Thanks for telling us, S...)
- The butterflies, the birds, the fish, the sunrises.
- The masseurs.  There were two.  They were both exceptional.  You get one free session per week.  

Some less good things:
- The yoga: we were hoping that by flying to Sri Lanka, near the founding home of yoga, there would be a local instructor.  But no, we had a sweet couple from Clapham who did a class a bit more basic than the one at my London gym.
- The Ayurvedic ""treatments"" - the ""doctor"" appears to recite exactly the same diagnosis to everyone, after a cursory stroke of their wrist.
- The weather: it rained every day (we were there in December, supposedly dry season)
- The ""gardens"": the main part of Ulpotha near the swamp is a dark swamp.  Perhaps they're used as paddy fields at other times of year, but when we were there it looked like a chemical waste dump - square pits with muddy water at the bottom; the paths are built on walls of sandy mud around the pits.  They clearly make no effort whatsoever to make it look pretty - perhaps that would upset the natural balance too much.
- The complete lack of information.  S. the manager is so useless and unhelpful that you're expected to divine everything.  They don't even give you a map.
- The laundry: it took forever, and came back dirtier than when we sent it off.  Honestly.
- The cliquiness: because you're thrown together with 20 people (our group were a sweet mix of mostly South Londoners in their 30s and 40s), you spend your entire time answering the same questions - how long you're here, how much yoga do you do back home, how are you finding the food, have you climbed up to the monastery yet, where are you travelling next...)
- The damp.  Everything gets damp.  Damp clothes.  Damp towels.  Damp beds.  damp skin.  Damp squib.
- The party: it's a yoga retreat - sure, the traditional drummers were lovely.  But we really didn't come here to drink beer and Arrack and dance to Britney and M.C. Hammer until 4am.  So we didn't.  But we did have to endure the music pumping all night from our hut (no doors).  And everyone complaining about their hangovers the next day.  yawn.

Actually, the party was the final straw.
We decided to leave.  After three nights.  We couldn't bear to stay another hour in this hell-hole.
Ulpotha make you pay up-front (now I know why), so we ended up spending over $1000 per night for the nights we were there.  Ouch.

But first we needed to find S.  The person ""in charge"".  No sign of her at 7am yoga.  Or at 9am breakfast.  We wandered through the house (the house is charming, but you always feel like you're intruding on the owners).  Still no sign.  At 10.30 we decided this was getting silly, so we went to her hut.   It just happened to be the loveliest hut of all - with glorious uninterrupted views across paddy fields.  S. was snoring loudly.  We coughed.  We knocked.  In the end we had to yell.  ""Sorry to wake you, but we'd like to leave today - is there someone else on duty we should be asking for help?"" - ""Sorry, it is me who's on duty. But I was up till 4am.""

Really, but have you ever heard of a place that charges $400 per room per night, where the manager says ""sod the guests, I'm hungover, I think I'll sleep a bit longer""?  
And that pretty much sums up Ulpotha.  You fit into our routine - this is how we do things here - you were dumb enough to give us your money in advance, now you'd better grin and bear it... Breathe... If you're not enjoying it it's not our fault.

There's no concept of service here.  No ""what could we do to make your stay more enjoyable?""  Let's think: if I were running a $400/night establishment, I might say ""it's raining: let's send umbrellas round to people's huts so they don't get wet?"" - naah, at Ulpotha you just get wet.  Or I might ask ""Would you like a wake up call before morning yoga?"".  Naah, at Ulpotha you have to use your traditional iPhone (even though there's nowhere to plug it in).  Or I might think - ""after their 4 hour much-delayed hellish journey, let's get them a hot towel and a refreshing juice to make them feel welcome"".  Naah, at Ulpotha you can make yourself a cup of tea from the pot, mind your head, and if you wait until supper in 2 hours' time you can help yourself to  juice then.  What do you think we are, a hotel?!

Ulpotha could be utopia if they made a little effort.  But they're resting on their yoga mats.  The place reeks of smugness, disdain and terminal decay.

Unfortunately, our experience was anything but that.
Right from the start, there were multiple service issues. On more than one occasion, the buggy service was unreliable at times it didn’t arrive at all, and we were left walking in the freezing cold at night just to reach the restaurant (mind you this is the best suit that is available in the hotel). On another morning, we requested a buggy around 6:30am to leave for Horton Plains, but were told that buggies weren’t available until 7am. That was fine we understood that could be a policy but what followed was deeply unsettling.
That morning, since we had no mobile signal during the hike, we were completely unaware that our families had been frantically trying to reach us. It turns out the hotel had contacted them, informing them that we hadn’t had dinner or breakfast (which was incorrect, we had ordered room service and skipped breakfast by choice). They further assumed that we hadn’t returned to the hotel at all the previous night. What shocked us was that no one had even checked to see if our car was in the car park before making such a serious assumption (we were out of the hotel only for 6 hours). We strongly felt they assumed we had left without settling our bill. This premature conclusion caused unnecessary panic for our loved ones and completely ruined the mood of our trip.
What’s worse is how the staff responded when we returned. Instead of a simple apology or acknowledgement, we were met with stares and uncomfortable looks from the team. The General Manager, Mr. Pushpitha Udawatta, attempted to justify what had happened rather than accept responsibility, which we found unprofessional and dismissive. If you read through other one-star reviews, you’ll notice this seems to be a pattern. It’s extremely disappointing to see that this kind of behavior seems to be tolerated or ignored by upper management above him. 
There were smaller but still unpleasant moments throughout for example, when we asked to be seated away from the sun at breakfast, a waiter gave us a look and refused our request quite rudely. These interactions, while minor on their own, added up and reflected a lack of hospitality and warmth that any guest, especially honeymooners should expect.
When we expressed our disappointment and told them we would be leaving a review, they offered to reduce our remaining balance by 50%. While we initially insisted on paying the full amount, we eventually ended up paying the discounted total, not because the experience deserved it, but simply because we were drained and wanted to leave without further conflict.
We had another night booked but chose to check out early. We truly hope that someone in the hotel’s upper management (above Pushpitha) or ownership takes a serious look at how these situations are handled. Until then, we would not recommend this property to anyone especially not for a special occasion like a honeymoon.","A Disappointing and Stressful Honeymoon Experience","2025-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r1016475952-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent experience with us. I sincerely apologize for the distress and frustration you encountered during your departure.

I want to clarify that I've been overseas for the past few days, which has limited my access to the phone. This is why I couldn’t reach out to you directly.

To explain the situation further: the Local DMC was fully committed to making your room payment before your check-in; however, they unfortunately did not fulfill this obligation prior to your checkout. My team has been in regular contact with them to ensure the payment was made, and they assured us that it would be completed before your departure. Regrettably, they did not follow through on this commitment.

As per our agreement with your local agent, if the payment is not made, we are unable to release the guest. This is why there was a hold on your checkout. Our team members made every effort to explain the situation clearly and extended our hospitality during your wait by offering refreshments to make you more comfortable.

I am genuinely shocked and disheartened to learn that, despite our attempts to facilitate a pleasant experience, you left feeling unsatisfied. Your comments are invaluable to us as we strive to improve our services.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope we have the opportunity to regain your trust in the future.

The hotel looks decent from the outside, but that’s where the illusion ends. The rooms are tiny, and the so-called balcony is barely a ledge — nothing like what’s shown in the pictures. It’s clear this property has invested in clever photography and false advertising to attract bookings.

When I politely mentioned my dissatisfaction, I was approached by a man who seemed unofficial, aggressive, and completely unprofessional. He told me directly,

“You either stay here or pay USD 150 to upgrade.”
The way it was said felt threatening and completely unacceptable — not the kind of tone any guest, especially an international traveler, should face at a hotel claiming to be “5-star.”

He even claimed “no hotels here have balconies,” which is simply not true. It felt like a rehearsed excuse to trap guests into upgrades. Based on my experience, it seems like the hotel may be collaborating with local tour agents to deliberately mislead tourists and then push them for more money on arrival.

The overall hospitality was poor, the experience felt dishonest and unsafe, and I would strongly caution any foreign traveler from booking here.

The bathroom was worn out, with chipped tiles and yellow grouting in the shower cabin. The sink was chipped. Nothing in our room was of five star quality. It was not even 4 star standards. We were met with hostility by the reception and the management when we raised our concerns. In general, cleaners, porters and cooks provide excellent service, while managers are mostly talking to each other at the reception and not particularly interested in the customers needs. 
The person in charge of the pool Akita was extremely lovely and very helpful. He knows how to talk to customers and provided some helpful information about the area.

Arrived at 2pm which is check in.  Room was not ready and they kept delaying the time it would be ready.  The staff did not seem to care much and just told us to sit and wait.  Traveling with 2 small children who needed to nap so the 1.5 hour delay on check in was awful. 

Upon checkout similar situation it took them 30 minutes to check us out.  Again just told to sit there and wait.  Then we lost the key (normal plastic keycard) and they wanted us to take all of our luggage out of the van and open every suitcase up to look for it.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on our social platform. As a leading customer-care hotel in the region, we genuinely value all feedback as it helps us grow and improve.

We were surprised to see your review, as we respectfully disagree with your feelings of disappointment regarding certain aspects of your experience during your brief visit. We take great pride in welcoming all our guests with warm hospitality and maintaining the highest standards throughout their stay. Our strength lies in engaging with our guests from the moment they arrive, striving to identify and fulfill their requests promptly. Each interaction reflects our commitment to exceptional service, and we believe that a great first impression can set the tone for the entire experience, whether guests are staying with us or just visiting.

Regarding your inquiry about the event for your organization, we are thrilled that you considered us as a potential venue. We conveyed the positive feedback from your conversation with our Food and Beverage Manager and understood that a final decision would be communicated after your parents' meeting. Upon your follow-up call, we learned of changes to both the proposed date and guest count. While we genuinely value the opportunity to collaborate, we must emphasize that due to our high occupancy and these recent adjustments, we were unable to accommodate your function. Additionally, I’d like to clarify that our banquet hall is not equipped with soundproofing, which could potentially disrupt the tranquil environment we strive to provide for our in-house guests. We hope for your understanding in this matter, given your experience in managing an educational institution.

As a leading hotel in the country, we take immense pride in our dedicated professional team, who are skilled at making clear decisions and managing high-pressure situations. True success, in our view, lies not solely in financial gains but in fostering exceptional customer experiences. While your review implies that our focus should be on prioritizing revenue, we firmly believe that centering on customer satisfaction ultimately drives our success. Our unwavering commitment to our guests is what sets us apart and allows us to thrive in a competitive industry.

Thank you for your understanding.

As we know at any hotel there is a welcome drink that is served to any guest. It may be a foreigner, local or an outsider from another city. The front office  people were just chatting to each other, not taking any care of us, maybe as we were from Nuwara Eliya. But, as soon as they saw some buses coming, they were busy with their preparation of welcome drinks for the guests. First of all  customer service is selective and poor, the girls at the reception need to be more respectful, cheerful, helpful and able to cater all guests at the door step. 
We had to wait for some time until our message had gone through to the relevant person, and to come and meet us, as to why we were there. We were met by the Food and Beverage Manager, We told him our requirement, and what we want. But his response was negative.  We wanted a hall to accommodate 60 to 70 guests and 30 kids, for our annual concert, including a buffet after the concert. He mentioned that the hall is not sound proof, There will be  guests in the rooms and it will disturb them, and he wont be able to arrange us the buffet. As it might clash with the in house guests, and wont be able to give us the other restaurant as it will cost us more.  Well management we are there to give you an business after planning with all the expenses, and cost . Its your duty to somehow get the business in and promote your hotel.  We are there to spend and give our parents and kids the experience of a life time.
If the hall is not sound proof better close it down and make it a store room, and from what we know any hotel is there to cater any kind of function and promote themselves to make an income.
But, very unfortunate, The Golden Ridge Hotel has a team which cannot handle the pressure, and just looking  on the rooms and the two restaurants.
We had our function in a star class hotel in Nuwara Eliya, from 2pm to 10 pm, on the 21st of December, 2024, almost spending a staggering amount of Rs.1000000/=. Sad to say that the management or the owner  is not capable  to help and provide the service to the people of Nuwara Eliya.
Think about it, and get closer to the people around you, dont forget the past when businesses were flat and down. With a blink of an eye everything will be gone in the 
wind. Be reasonable, respectful and helpful, every business big or small is important to you now and later.

Service:
Initially the staff members greet you but then they become very indifferent and not so friendly. The behaviour of restaurant staff and service quality (a la carte) was extremely poor and we left the restaurant hungry after waiting for an hour on the most special occasion of our lives. Though they claim that they make fresh food  (for a la carte) the service however was being rendered from the buffet spread. No one bothered to come back to us post complaining that we have left empty stomach. One does not feel this in buffet meal as one has to serve himself. Every time we wanted something in the restaurant we had to get up and call the waiter since they were all clustered together in one corner of a quite big restaurant with a glass wall in between. Next day we  got food packed for ourselves from outside.House keeping service was good

Location:
The location of the hotel is not very encouraging as the rooms are overlooking the main road and it becomes noisy at times. It is 2 to 3 kms from the main town and one doesn't get a feeling of being in ""little england"". If you go there, stay staying in the main town or near Gregory Lake. There are some wonderful places to stay and the ambience is also good. This place will be a waste of time and money

Checkin out

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback regarding your recent stay with us at The Golden Ridge. We genuinely appreciate your insights, as they are invaluable in helping us enhance our service.

We are particularly concerned about your comments regarding air conditioning. Due to the naturally cooler climate in Nuwara Eliya, certain rooms on our property are designed without air conditioning, as heating is typically required for guest comfort. We strive to provide transparent information to both our booking agents and on our online platforms to ensure our guests are well-informed prior to their arrival. I hope you had the opportunity to review this information during your booking process. If you had intended to request a room with air conditioning, I kindly ask you to discuss this matter further with your booking agent. They can assist you in exploring the possibility of changing to an air-conditioned room category; please be aware that this may involve an additional cost. However, we understand that you have chosen to decline this option.

I would also like to remind you that upon check-in, our reception staff clearly communicated that the minibar is available upon request. Unfortunately, it seems we did not receive any requests for minibar service during your stay.

Additionally, I understand you had concerns regarding the IPTV service. To clarify, we offer more than 9 local channels and 41 international channels for your viewing pleasure, and we were surprised to hear that this was not noted during your stay.

Furthermore, we are disheartened to hear about your interactions with our staff at both reception and in the restaurant. It is unacceptable for any guest to feel disregarded or treated rudely, and we will address this matter with our team immediately to reinforce our commitment to exceptional customer service.

We truly appreciate your feedback, as it helps us improve our services. Should you have any further concerns or if there is anything we can do to assist you, please feel free to reach out to our Operations Manager at om@thegoldenridge.com.

Thank you once again for your valuable input, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you better in the future.

Best regards,

Reasons for not considering it 5 star
1. The main building family room has no air-conditioning.  I couldn't sleep the entire night. When I complained the  general manager pushpitha  put it on the agency's head who did the booking. What kind of a facility gets 5 star rating with half of the rooms not having air-conditioning. It's only the mountain chalets which have the air conditioning. The reason given for no air-conditioning is Nuwara eliya is cool and there is heater provided.  So beware when you book. My family could not sleep the entire night and we were provided fans. So it's a 5 star facility with fans.
2. The mini bar is kept empty.  Another criteria for being 5 star is a mini bar stocked up. Here it's empty.
3. Staff at reception and restaurant were rude and without empathy and a lot of arrogance. 
4. In the restaurant I asked for a spoon. The server Sampath gave me one and while handing over remarked you will find more in the restaurant so take it. He then delayed the coffee I asked for just ignoring my request. I then went to Sumu the restaurant supervisor who got me the coffee soon enough. This level of disregard for customer is not acceptable in the 5 star Hotel industry
5. They advertise IpTV with multiple channels. You will actually get 4 or 4 Srilankan channels. Rest you get message as  not subscribed.
I would not recommend this hotel. If you are a seasoned traveller used to 5 star luxury you will certainly find my comments worth your while.","Not a 5 star rated facility if you compare with 5 star criteria","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d15039915-r974215725-The_Golden_Ridge_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We had one delux room and one premium room ( more money).  They are old  British bungalows and rooms are bad.  We checked in at 5:30 and the commotion went on till 7:30.  First wifi didn’t work at all and they said the technician will set a new router ( pathetic - running for a router after you  check in).  That never got fixed. Premium  room did’t have any seats to sit other than floor or bed whereas delux room had seats.  Funny that the boys moving the two seats from the lobby of the bungalow.  No safe deposit lockers.  When complained they are hand carrying two safety lockers and they said they are short of it and hence moving safe deposit lockers.  They treat that you are stupid to belive that.  If I keep any valuables one can steal the whole safe deposit locker ( not fixed). According to them it is moving.  They were ready to move us to main building where the rooms are nicer.  They said all are booked.  I said I will not pay full price because your rooms do not have the things you said.  Immediately they  have have cancellation ( what a sleezy lie) and are ready  to transfer us. Wow cancellation right after they talk to a ghost Manager who would not show up.   To get settled it took more than two hours for us ( two rooms). Although main building is good, the banglow rooms are non functioning dungeons.  AVOID.  They don’t own up.  You get sick of them sayin repeatedly sir sir etc.  
the premium room didn’t even have cookies as in delux room.  When asked the answer - wee are baking ( ha ha even after two hours)
Food - you have buffet for 8000 LKR.  I am not a big eater and no menu to order.  Another restaurant had only western food and it was very expensive.  
Location isn’t particularly great either.  

Pick Bungalow room and interact with the staff if you want to be treated as stupid, waste three hours of evening ( or get entertained ) by staff moving furniture to your room, fixing heater, fixing wifi, getting cookies by baking two hrs and ongoing, hand delivering a safe (unsafe since movable)locker because of shortage in that hotel, finding cancellations on the spot for a fully booked hotel etc.

내용: 70대인 저희 노부부는 
한국의 여행사 '트립 빌리지'를 통해
남인도 스리랑카 15일 여행을 다녀 왔습니다
여행중 2월 10일,11일 
스리랑카 'Amaya Lake Hotel' 에서 2박을 했는데 둘째날 밤에 
제 인생 최악의 순간을 겪었습니다
믿을 수 없는 일이 벌어졌습니다. 
10시30분쯤 소등을 하고 누웠는데
잠시후 노크소리가 나서 
'뭐지' 하며 귀를 기울였는데
다시 좀더 세게 노크소리가 들렸습니다
동행한 멤버께서 필요한 일이 있나보다 생각하고 도어에 안전고리가 없음을 알고 있었기에 살짝만 열었는데
강도가 세게 밀치고 침입해 
돈을 요구했습니다
너무나도 공포스러운 순간이었습니다
그는 돈을 여러차례 요구하며 남편의 가슴에 흉기를 겨눴고 더 
깊숙히 들어오며 팔을 찔렀습니다. 
처음엔 떨며 잠시 실랑이를 하다가
남편이 소리치며 제압하는듯 하여
저는 극한의 공포속에서 창문을 마구 두드리며 살려달라고 소리쳤고
다행히 강도는 도망쳤습니다
어두워서 식별이 정확치는 않으나
흉기가 칼이나 총은 아닌듯 했습니다
폰을 찾아 강도가 들었으니 빨리 와 달라고 직원에게 다급함을 호소하고
넘 무서워 밖에 나와 떨며 
기다렸으나 빨리오지 않아
강도가 뭔가를 팔에 쏘아
남편이 어지러워  한다고
제발 빨리 와달라고
두번째 콜을 했더니 직원 여러분이 
바로 왔고 한참후 지역 경찰들도 왔습니다 다음날 아침에 투어리스트 경찰들이 와서 사건경위 조서도 썼습니다
출발전 직원들의 사과멘트가 있었고 오전중에 
'Resident Manager' 의
사과 메세지가 E-mail로 왔습니다 
저는 상황을 직접 전하고 싶어 사건전말을 소상히 적어 
답신을 보냈습니다
그러나 이후로 어떤 메시지나 
조치 과정에 관한 소식이 지금까지도 전혀 없었습니다
저는 외상 후 스트레스 중후군으로
아직도 시달리고 있는데
호텔은 시간이 지나고 흐지부지 무시하려는 것인지
이를 전혀 신경 쓰지 않는 듯 합니다
호텔방 도어에는 안전 고리도 없었고 
기본적인 보안도 갖추지 않았을 뿐만 아니라 cctv 카메라도 제대로 갖추지 않은듯 범인의 흔적을 못찾고 있는듯 했습니다
너무나도 공포스러운 순간이었고, 
시간이 지나면 충격이 가라 앉으려나 
싶어 한달을 참고 기다렸는데
지금도 정신적인 충격에서 벗어나지 못하고 있습니다
투숙객의 안전을 보장할 능력도 
책임을 질 의지도 없는 호텔측을
생각하면 몹시 화가 납니다
사건이후 남은 6일 동안은
일행분들께 폐가 될까봐 숨죽이고

We went back to our room via buggy but squashed 3 in the back so we got very wet from the rain pouring off the sides.  Our shower was blocked so water leaked over the floor and was very slippery.

I actually choose a long vacation in Sri Lanka as I am happy to support a Country that I love and visited many times.

Saying that, the experience at Amaya Lake was kinda disappointing, and very different to the experience I had 4 years ago here.

The welcoming wasn’t warm.
The receptionist didn’t provide clear informations about breakfast and restaurant timings, she was confused and confusing.
The room (bungalow 49) was dirty. Geckos poo, dead insects and dust everywhere, bedsheets included.
Ants were marching literally in every corner of the bungalow. From the bed frame to the bathroom mirror, from the kettle to the mattress. 
I understand the place is in the middle of nature but clearly something was mismanaged in terms of cleanliness routines.
The shower head wasn’t working properly and it was so dirt and clogged that water was sprinkling all over the place, ceiling included. Impossible to take a shower. (But brace yourself, as this turned out not to be the worst part of the shower area)
We called and they changed the shower head. At that point it worked almost fine.
They also realized the ant situation was too bad so they cleaned the room: at that point it was late and we were quite tired.

After some of the issues were somehow rectified I went to the bathroom and found a big frog on the wall. I was a bit surprised and was wondering if all that wildlife was supposed to live in the bungalows… while reflecting on that I noticed a movement with the corner of my eye. I looked behind me and a snake was in the shower. I was shocked. It looked very bad and quite big: black with some yellow rings and stripes and I don’t know why but I felt it wasn’t a harmless one. 
I ran back in the room and immediately called the reception. They arrived only 20 mins later while we were standing on the bed terrified looking at the bathroom where the snake was patrolling around (maybe looking for that frog on the wall?!?)
When staff arrived they actually looked worried as well when they saw the type of snake: they tried to minimize but they were clearly not what they expected …
At that point we were considering to check out but it was 11pm and we were in an isolated place. Far away from anything.
The manager upgraded us to a signature suite.
Now, in all honesty at that point we were not able to appreciate the high standard of the upgraded room (the design and layout was really good for sure) as we were scared to find other surprises. Having no choice we agreed to stay as the room looked newer and overall more “sealed” from the outside wildlife.
Although a premium suite the room presented again many issues clearly due to poor cleaning schedule. Ants were there, balcony/patio constantly infested of geckos poo that was attracting millions of ants.
Also the Jacuzzi bath tube was worn out with loose pieces of metal falling off.

Buffet was ok but expect most of the food quite spicy.

Based on the situation it’s clear that Amaya was closed for so long due to Covid that somehow nature took over the place. That is understandable but a thorough cleaning schedule and staff checking the premises regularly would have fixed the issues. 
It is a premium and expensive hotel so snakes, ants and dirt are not acceptable and this doesn’t have anything to do with the problems Sri Lanka is going through as there is plenty of staff on the premises, it’s just a question of managing resources correctly.
On a final note the receptionists were quite unskilled and so was the staff at the restaurant.
Amaya: organize a good leadership for this place and bring it back to the 5 star resort it should be.","A snake and poor maintenance & cleanliness","2022-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r848905602-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

They capture neighbourhood dogs that come looking for food, in cages that are similar to rat traps. They also don’t check on the dog for a long while no matter how much it screams. The captured dogs get dropped in faraway places. That’s what one of the staff members said, but god knows what they actually do.

This was shared by a guest who heard a dog whining for a long time, so he took a tour to find out and managed to release the poor fellow. This is cruel and the hotel should really learn how to take care of the environment they live in better than this!

There were pile of dead ants on our bed and pillows, and some spiders on the headboard of the bed. There was a gecko on the wall, and gecko poop in allover bathroom floor and walls. There were stains in bed coverlets, in the commode, and sink. The shower was a regular old fashion one, not a rain shower, and water was spraying in all angles. The mini bar was empty, there was a notice to keep the valuables in the safe, but no safe.There were dust around the complementary coffee and tea bags, live ants all over the kettle, even inside, and by the looks, the kettle has not been properly cleaned in ages. And the room is not sound proof at all, we could hear next room people talking and the sound of their TV clearly, and from the bathroom, we could hear they flushing the toilet. And TV was very small, not a standard TV we see in other star class hotels. Food variety in the buffet was also very less compared to other hotels, and taste was not so good.

 Ayubowan from Amaya Resorts

Thank you for sharing your experience on your recent stay. 

Amaya Lake is a popular  destination for weekend getaways hence attract guests during weekends . Our inquiry  revealed that you have been offered ""The Set Menu"" at Signature Restaurant’ , as an option if you  needed  to avoid obtaining Buffet meals .
 
 Your comment about food came as a surprise since  most of the other Sri Lankan guests had offered their sincere gratitude for arranging a variety of Authentic Sri Lankan dishes for the buffet. The chef had arranged B.B.Q. buffet  and a selection of Vegetarian Dishes too were offered  for  guests  who may prefer  vegetarian meals. Most of the Guests were really satisfied with the meal set up and no complaints were reported .
 
The management  had checked the defects reported and found that the taps in the sink could operate moderately and, the ventilators are functioning.
 
We greatly appreciate your sending this feedback giving us a chance to inquire into it. Your comments have been brought to the attention of Senior Management and the  team  will work towards to offer a pleasant stay for all our valued guests.

Warmest regards

We stayed at the signature  division which is the upmarket section.
The rooms were large and very nicely built with all modern amenities. Bathrooms were spacious and clean (at the start) and there is a fairly large closet area which was fantastic. The hotel garden was well maintained and the pools were clean.

Other than that the rest of our two nights stay is awful.
Since we were there in a long weekend and with discounted rates, the hotel was almost full with the overwhelming majority of local travelers.
The resturent was crowded and crampy. The food selection was mediocre with some of the items being served deliberately in small portions.
All the meals we had (5) were the same except for one breakfast which was ok.
The resturent waiters were unhappy,rude and unhelpful. Even the meals we ordered ala-carte were served late and tasted awful.
The biggest disappointment was the rooms. Two out of three rooms we stayed became extremely smelly soon after we checked in. It was probably the bathrooms which did not have functioning ventilator system. Two rooms had the bidet tap fixed on the left side of the toilet. The wash basin looked fancy but very impractical causing spash all over as soon as you open the tap.
All in all, it was apparent that the management had seriously degrades the service level and was on maximum cost cutting mode. It was a shame for such a lovely hotel.","Aweful service and food","2019-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r675810094-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",

-80% of the Staff were genuinely friendly and quick to help

Negatives
-From the Check in point it was a big let down
-No Fans/No A/C and No wind in the lobby in a 30+ 'C degree temperature it was pretty unbearable 
-After initially speaking to a SO CALLED GUEST RELATIONS OFFICER IN A BEIGE & BLUE  KANDYAN OUTFIT (UNIFORM) never attended to check us in at that point of 2pm time . and those who came after us had already left with their rooms
-after mentioning 3 times finally received proper formalities to check in while we suffered at the lobby for 4 rooms for a group of 8people which were booked in JANUARY 2019 (NO APOLOGIES RECEIVED THERE) and only 1 room was given even at 3pm UN- BELIEVABLE 
-A/C malfunction which was never rectified and not worked to cool enough as an A/C should
-IT Was only disappointment on Day 1 of our day 3 stay
-Very pricey in room dining
-These VIllas (rooms) are sitauated away from all hotel amenities and would take about 10min to reach them or more, in the scorching sun and the heat.
-Only treats Foreigners with exclusive facilities as Shuttle service
If you are in for No LUXURY and Able to survive the heat with NO fan in room and malfunctioning a/c and no entertainment which are mentioned on their site, this is the place for you
-the Parked car took 1 hour to reach the entrance and our 10month old baby had to yet again suffer in the heat of their lobby as the a/c wasnt there. Sure they call you to ask to Check out on time(WITHOUT FAILING) but they dont make arangements to bring your CAR ON TIME BLOODY ABSURD PLACE

I am a Marriott platinum  member and this is easily the worst property I have stayed in on the Indian subcontinent 
 I had problems during my last stay but chose to stay again for 2 nights due to the good location 
At Check in I was promised an upgrade as platinum if I waited an hour which did not transpire even after waiting 2 hours and I was then given an ordinary room No one from management contacted me and there was no attempt at service recovery (when I reported this to Marriott Bonvoy the credited me 3000 points as a nice gesture ) 
Room is small and cramped just one chair for 2 people - poorly designed bathroom where the shower stall leaks 
Breakfast was chaotic and disorganised you couldn’t get a plate of eggs toast bacon and beans without traversing at keast 4 separate stations so at least one item would be cold by the time you secured your breakfast The hoppers were either leathery or burnt - staff were poorly trained and engaged in conversation with each other rather than attending to essential matters ( no salt and pepper on tables, no teaspoon with the coffee etc..) 
To top it all after my stay  I received from a trainee an email request to rate the hotel by but the customary link to do so was missing, clearly an attempt to evade Marriott’s  standards monitoring policy
Two stars for location but the trade off is now unacceptable They  have high occupancy from the low end conference and meeting trade but this will change very quickly if standards are kept low in a city with an excess of hotel rooms.
 For Marriott Bonvoy members there is a much better Sheraton and a more expensive but new ITC luxury collection property For value seekers cinnamon red, the radisson and similar 4 stars offer much better value","Disappointing and sloppy","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23996995-r990000202-Courtyard_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

This is the second incident where your establishment has failed to meet basic dietary requests, demonstrating a blatant disregard for customer safety and preferences.

Previously, you served pork to my Muslim friend who explicitly asked for chicken. This alone was unacceptable. Today, however, you served me prawn cutlets instead of the chicken cutlets I ordered. I am severely allergic to prawns. Fortunately, I had my medication and an EpiPen with me, but your staff's negligence could have resulted in a life-threatening situation.

When I inquired if the cutlets were prawns, your staff took an unacceptably long time to confirm. Imagine if I didn't have my medication with me—the consequences could have been disastrous.

This pattern of carelessness is inexcusable. Your staff's lack of attention to dietary requests is not only disrespectful but also poses serious health risks.

However since there was a Turkish food promotion taking place , I visited the Beira Kitchen and once again it was chaos. We visited at 8.15pm and were assured that food would not run out and would be replenished. Therefore we waited till a table was prepared and commenced our meal at 8.40pm. When we went to serve the main course at 9pm the dishes were already empty. Just gravy in the prawn curry. When you attempt to ask the staff about replenishing they look away. Very limited options. People serving themselves Turkish desserts and eating while standing near the buffet. It was inevitable that the desserts would run out too. We had to serve our mains and desserts at once to ensure we would not be disappointed further.  We finished our mains and still felt hungry as there was only beef, some indian veg items and eggplant which we dont fancy. I then decided to have a soup and there were no bowls. I asked the Manager if I could get a soup bowl to which he frowned and replied ""what u want???"" . The staff then opened a little cupboard below and started replenishing crockery while I had to stand and wait for him to finish. While waiting for this task to be completed I looked over ad realised that several Turkish sweets had run out and the same available items had been placed in all dishes. 
If you are unable to cater beyond a certain number, please dont accept more reservations than is possible. This is not the first time this has happened and is a norm at this hotel. A buffet should not be on first come first serve basis when all guests are paying the same amount. If you are unable to accept please dont give false assurances and accept. 
When someone posts a review or complains a lovely apology is posted but no action is taken. This hotel just keeps cheating patrons.

We went for an à la carte dinner and specifically ordered a chicken sausage dish for our Muslim friend, only to find out later that they had served us pork sausages. He unknowingly consumed a few before the mistake became apparent. The staff didn't even have the courtesy to inform us of the mix-up.

To make matters worse, we ordered a watermelon juice which tasted overwhelmingly of rotten fruit and had an atrocious smell. Even a staff member agreed that the aroma was off-putting when we raised our concerns.

This experience has been the absolute nadir of all my stays and dining experiences in the Marriott chain. I expect far better attention to detail and respect for dietary requirements from such a reputable brand.

The hotel is way smaller than what the show on the social media. Pool area is so small and have so many steps. So if you trip one step you are directly at the pool. Such a joke. Two people can’t even walk side by side near the pool, it’s that narrow. We sat down at the restaurant and the waiter could not speak much English and he got our order wrong. Me and my friend both ordered the pork chops but with different condiments. He bought us the same dish. Was disappointed. Ordered the mint lime drink and it was soo sour. I can’t understand how they can send that drink without even tasting it. Then we had to ask for additional sugar syrup. When the dish came to the table we were even more disappointed. Spent almost Rs. 4000 for 2 small pieces of pork chops filled with bones. There were nothing much to eat actually. Very disappointed with the service and the food.

This was my second visit. Although we experienced pretty much the same thing on our first visit, we gave them the benefit of the doubt last time as we thought these were teething issues. Apparently not.

I will start with the plus points. The hotel is new and tastefully decorated, the ambience is lovely, the staff is extremely polite, pleasant and courteous. 
Our issue however was with the buffet a at Beira Kitchen which seems to work on first come first serve basis. By 8.15 half the buffet display was empty. Not exaggerating here either. Salad bar almost empty apart from some tomatos and Leafy greens and not replenished. The mains ; grilled fish was just bones and heads. This remained on display and no replenishing done, chillie chicken empty, I'm assuming there were prawns and cuttlefish in the seafood casserole but cannot really be sure as only some small, crushed pieces of fish were remaining. No replenishing was done. I do understand some guests have a habit of picking out certain items but this is foreseeable and therefore unacceptable. Only the Sri lankan and Indian corners had a proper display of food which was rather disappointing. 

The mains however, especially the Indian cuisine was very tasty. maybe the best in Colombo at present. The Sri Lankan cuisine was nice too. Maybe the Western and oriental cuisine was good too but since only the pumpkin mash and boiled vegetables were left it's not possible to comment. 
Desserts need much improvement.

This was the second time this happened. Last time there were no desserts left. 

For a buffet priced at approx. LKR6500/= per person this was a complete waste of money. For an esteemed hotel chain such as Marriot this experience is a complete insult.
