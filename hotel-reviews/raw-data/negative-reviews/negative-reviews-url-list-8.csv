Thank you for choosing AVANI Kalutara Resort to spend your valuable time and taking the time to share your valuable experience with us. Your invaluable feedback and rating will help us continually improve the standard and level of our service offered to all of our AVANI guests.

Please do accept our sincere apology and I was extremely disappointed to read that we were not able to Exceed your expectations at this time. Your feedback regarding the highlighted point, specially related to the signature on the CC slip, will be reviewed with our management team for further enhancement and also, we ensure that further action, necessary changes, and training will be initiated so such an occurrence is not repeated in the future.   

However, please allow me to explain the point that you have brought into our notice with the Electricity and Wi-Fi, we had an issue with our power supply lines and they were under repair even though we switched on the normal lights. It was not 100% recommended by our chief Engineer to go on with all the machines, until his green light, so we couldn’t open our Wi-Fi lines at the time you walk-in to the bar area, However, all our team members were well aware about the electricity and Wi-Fi issue that keep communicated to the guest promptly. 
Once again I apologize for the shortfalls experienced, and please be assured your constructive feedback is well taken. Our overriding goal is always to provide all our guests with a pleasant and relaxing experience, as I am sure you will be able to see on your next visit and therefore, we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and improve on your experience in the near future.

Avani boasts that they are “located on a peninsula all our own,” but they fail to mention that they allow garbage to pile up on their peninsula. I sat at a table in the bar area and had a stunning view of an inlet heaped with trash and filth. The trashy atmosphere was complimented with an apparently all-subwoofer sound system that pulsed through the whole place.

When I finally went to pay, their system wasn’t working, so the guy behind the counter did the math by hand on a scrap of paper and input the total into a little handheld device. Instead of giving it to me to sign for my credit card, he simply forged my signature without my consent.

Further we need to sit by the non-aircondirioned and mosquito overrun lobby area by the BAR (with 2 kids!) and eat a la carte there! We were appalled and walked up to our room to order some rubbish from the awful room service menu.

guests to sit and eat from the restaurant menu! We have traveled all around the world but never seen such nonsense like this. When you sit down at a restaurant to eat, you don't insult guests by asking them to leave the restaurant and eat some place else!

We booked a three-night stay on a half-board basis and received a confirmation email stating that the total cost would be approximately LKR 100,000. We paid a 50% deposit in advance.

Before our arrival, the Front Manager contacted us two or three times, and we confirmed that we would be coming for dinner. Upon arrival, however, we were greeted rudely by the security personnel, who disrespectfully spoke to my husband. When we questioned his attitude, he replied, “Because you are wearing shorts and a t-shirt. I thought you were a driver.” This was incredibly embarrassing and left us feeling humiliated. We were shocked by such behaviour and disappointed that staff would judge and treat guests based on their attire or presumed occupation.

We were then directed to Anantara Kalutara for dinner, where we were informed that our booking was only for bed and breakfast, not half-board as we had booked and received no prior communication regarding this change. The Front Manager from Avani called us and insisted that we either pay for our dinner or accept sandwiches delivered to our room. This was highly disappointing, especially as we were traveling with our three-year-old son. As a result, we did not enjoy our dinner and returned to our room, which was also quite small and uncomfortable.
They should figure out their internal management issues and should not embarrass their guests based on their mistakes.

Given the circumstances, we decided to transfer to Anantara Kalutara the next morning. The staff at Anantara Kalutara were exceptional, completely transforming our mood and providing a pleasant environment to enjoy the remainder of our vacation in Sri Lanka. I would like to extend my gratitude to Anantara Kalutara for their outstanding service, which made a significant difference in our stay.","Bad experience","2024-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r969499774-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Systems were not updated and front office person named either ashan wanted his staff to bring my phone to check the payment instead of him reaching out to us who were the guest.
The do not disturb tag wasn’t available and despite requesting for both days it was not made available. Iron board in the room was so old that i had ti hold the board with one hand and iron with the other. The tripl room which there were 2 adults and 2 kids had only 3 500ml water bottles for a day.
Extremely poor entertainment during the xmas night. The solo guitarist was playing songs with great difficulty and hard to listen to. Coffee which we pay a premium price was just nescafe. As a hotel from the minor group we expected more luxury standards and friendlier staff.
the hotel had not got the headcount properly for the xmas dinner and we needed and extra chair, when we requested for one the staff’s reaction was as if were were trying to get someone from outside to eat free and was trying to get clarification from various persons if they should give the extra chair or not.
Overall the hotel was very poor in all the departments.
Only positive was the food. Executive chef was quite interactive and seemed interested in his guests unlike the fromt office staff.

We booked two rooms with a double full board meal plan.

Unfortunately, our experience with the food left much to be desired. The quality was mediocre and fell short of the standards we expected. The main restaurant's service was particularly disappointing; the staff was slow, and there was a lack of attentiveness. This aspect significantly impacted our overall enjoyment of the stay.

One specific incident that stood out was the pool attendant's attitude when providing us with towels. It's unclear whether the unpleasant interaction was due to our status as locals, but it certainly left a sour taste in our mouths.

However, it's crucial to mention the positive aspects of our stay as well. Ashan from the reservations team deserves special recognition for his outstanding service. He was understanding and went above and beyond to enhance our experience.

Regrettably, the shortcomings in dining quality and service overshadowed the positive interactions we had. In light of these issues, I would rate our overall experience at Avani Kalutara Resort a 2 out of 5.

It was an expensive holiday and this hotel labelled as 4 star most certainly was not. The staff were all very nice and helpful. However the hotel felt run down. The worst experience was the restaurant which was more like a factory canteen. It was noisy with loud music, the guests were scruffy and there seemed to be no evening dress code. We both chose chicken Tika massage which turned out to be large chunks of bone and grissel with very little chicken. We saw cockroaches on the floor, parts of the hotel carpet was stained and was dirty. We had a broken glass by our room door as we entered it. We complained to the manager. To his credit he apologized and welcomed our feedback. The end result was that we were moved to a sister hotel, the Anantara,  3 minutes walk away at no extra charge to ourselves.

The front desk staff couldn't provide the most competitive rate *(we had to call the reservation line and sit on hold-- I spent over an hour on hold cumulatively with the Minor brand line on our trip). Staff couldn't provide/recommend affordable transport (they had to offer the hotel rate which was $140 versus $45 which was the airport rate). I chose this hotel as a GHA platinum member and was eventually upgraded to an adequate room but our initial room was of very poor quality and clearly should have been $50 a night not $200.

Plus points 

It’s a Lovely looking hotel
Food was great in restaurant for breakfast,lunch and dinner - plenty of choice
The staff cannot do enough for you .
Check in and out very smooth 
Bags delivered quickly 
A large room 
Lovely pool
Partner had a great hour long hot stone massage and very reasonably priced 

Bad points

This is a mosquito haven and you will be feasted on, cover up head to toe , the hotel light some citronella  candles at night but there is so so much stagnant water around in ponds that it’s a breeding ground and like a mosquito hotel .

The hotel should supply a plug in mosquito repellent device in every room instead of a plug in air freshener to mask smell of drains.

Room 137 shower leaked all over floor as sealant was not doing its job.

Shower suddenly went to freezing then normal again but you never knew when it was gonna happen .

Mosquito screen coming off from behind wooden shutter above toilet 

Pop up plug in sink popped up 2mm so water took and age to drain 

All reported on feedback form so hopefully fixed soon . 

Overall great food and service but you will be bitten all over if you venture out in grounds any time of day .

During the stay they kept calling us requesting to move vehicles as some tractor or other requirement
This was such a nuisance and even after parking at the places they give yet we are bothered to move the vehicle
Also the security is so rude and they think they are the boss
They give more respect to the bus driver and harass the other guests

It cost an extra five thousand dollars to reserve a chalet.

Buffet/Main Meal Course: Despite it being a busy long weekend, only chicken and fish products are included for the first three buffets. The three buffets had not a single dish made with pork (wretched for this price). There's only sausages and fried fish in the evening barbecue. I'm not sure we were pleased with the meal. Both taste and variety are lacking.

Dessart items: Same items were repeatedly consisted in dessart carts, which just showed a lot of varieties there. Mainly, a lot of cakery items were included and not consisted of any standard type item (i.e., chocolate pudding); there are 03 banana-flavored category items were there, and they are not favorable for the majority.

Room: Bad odor comes from bathrooms. Even though it's a double, they had two twin mattresses coupled together; it is imperative to mention matrasses were not comfortable at all, and I have to suffer for back pain. 

The buffet is not satisfactory at all compared to the prices charged for the package. You may have enjoyed an international buffet at hotels like Turya Kalutara for the same prices.

All of us are senior citizens aged between 65 and 70 years. We were allotted room numbers 130,131 and 132.
On the 11th June we informed the hotel that we were going on a safari at the Yala National Park and we would require packed lunch as we would be away from 12.30 pm to 6.30pm.
Just before checking out on 12 June morning we found that 400 US dollars and 60 Singapore dollars were missing from the locked sale in room number 132 and 100 US dollars was missing from the safe in Room 131. Nothing was missing from room 130 as the occupants did not use the safe.
We are 100% sure that the money was stolen while we were away on the Safari as we had counted the money before putting it in the safe and locking it just before we left for the Safari.
We made a written complaint to the hotel management. Initially they told us in writing that they would compensate us by giving us half the amount that was stolen until such time as their internal investigation was done.
We then found that they kept on making some stupid excuses not to pay us even that.
On reaching Colombo we made a complaint to the tourism department and police on the 16th of June but we are still to hear from them.
After this the General Manager and the Operations manager spoke to me over the phone and said that since I had reported to the police they would not pay us any thing.

The floors throughout were dirty, the bathroom was as hot as a steam room due to the windows only being louvered wood with a mesh over. Therefore the air con didn’t have any impact in the bathroom. There were black round beetles which emerged from under the furniture and bed, plus a large spider on the second night, together with some winged creature, which “exploded” when I stamped on it. The bed linen was discolours and the pillows ancient and lumpy.
The shower leaked from all corners and the drain was smelly.

There were building works at the back of our room, sand, cement mixer, ladders, wood and the perimeter fencing had been removed too. This was quite disconcerting as this gave direct access to the resort and the groups of stray dogs were able to raid the bins, these were stored outside our door. They tore all the food and rubbish out, which only added to the fly and beetle problems.

The restaurant was overrun with flies, crawling over the tables and cutlery and the food was very average, variety poor too.

I certainly wouldn’t recommend and the online photographs must be when the hotel first opened as the condition now certainly isn’t the same as online, hotel overall very tired.

The staff are courteous and accomodating. Food is good. However, the hotel is a bit run down. The bathroom is very worn out. I gave the hotel a bad review because they said the room would be ready in 20 minutes but it took hours. I understand that the regular check in is 2pm and we arrived a bit early but they should have not said the room.would be ready soon. The main reason I gave a bad review was that the room and bathroom had a hundred mosquitoes when we entered. I understand that its near a jungle but it doesn't absolve them from the fact that it had that many mosquitoes. I killed 20 mosquitoes in the first 5 minutes of being in the room. The hotel explained that maybe there was a window left open but that wasn't our fault as the mosquitoes were there the moment we entered. We left the hotel immediately for activities and requested that they deal with the mosquitoes. The probably did but they didn't do a good job as there were still about 50 mosquitoes in the room and bathroom. I requested some mosquito spray and killed a bunch more. If I could kill that much mosquitoes I don't see why the staff couldn't. They had 4 hours to do so while we were out. The hotel should have just apologized instead of justifying why the room had that much mosquitoes. Other than the run down rooms and bathrooms and the mosquitoes, the stay was decent.

We complained again and we were given a spray bottle! Note, we have an infant! We killed the mosquitoes ourselves! I’m from a tropical country and I’ve never seen this many mosquitoes, as in hundreds! 
2. At 9pm, you offered a room change! We were all sleeping already, you even disturbed our sleep! The next morning, at breakfast, that’s when you offered the upgrade. You said for our next stay, as if we will ever go back to your horrible hotel. It was a fake offer! 
3. The toilet is not just 1 stall, it’s all the stalls that are that dirty. It “might” be your fault? Who else’s could it be? It’s all 3 stalls! I checked all. 
4. I understand standard check-in is 2pm. I’m not stupid. I’ve been to 60 countries and even more hotels. But your front desk said it will be ready by 12:30pm. So we waited! At 1:45pm, still no room! You shouldn’t have lied about that. 
5. We kept begging for food but you wouldn’t feed us! We wanted to order but you said no food until chef is done preparing! 
6. Hotel is also very run down. The refrigerator door fell down when we opened. I wasn’t able to take a photo. Sheets really itchy! 
You are the worst hotel in entire Sri Lanka and the attitude. I will report this to the travel agency with matching photos and tell them to blacklist you. Sadly TripAdvisor only allows 10 photos. You can’t even take criticisms! Why are you even in the service industry?

Aren’t they Buddhists who are afraid of karma, Hope they get reincarnated as mosquitoes for lying straight to guests faces!","Worst Liars!","2022-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1052197-r833577914-Chaarya_Resort_Spa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

The staff was not friendly or professional at all which we were utterly disappointed. Therefore we will never recommend and visit this hotel again. However, i look forward to speaking to a member from the management concerning this matter as we did face an uncomfortable situation whereas we were asked to leave the dining area before we have even completed having our meals which is unacceptable at all. 

Furthermore, i would say they need to respect the clients and provide us with a good service which i did not see since they only look into the money and apparently they chase you while having dinner which us as humans we wouldn't even do this to our pet dogs.

Thank you for your review and we do apologise that you did not enjoy your stay with us. We have reviewed all your concerns and please see our feedback below:

The hotel is in ruin - Tamarind Hill is a 250 year old manor house with interior decor to match this era. Maintaining the old world charm may at times seem dated to select guests. 

Tamarind Hill is located away from the hustle and bustle of the town and is as such more serene - though we do understand that the location and having to wait for tuk tuks has inconvenienced you.

The Telecom Tower is actually not within our premises but rather on the neighbouring premises.
 
With regard to your remarks on the rabbits - we have already moved the cage and thank you for your feedback. Additionally staff language skills are continually addressed in our ongoing trainings.

We are very concerned about your feedback on the missing ring and have completed a thorough investigation and feel this was not stolen by the hotel staff. Further, please do understand we have safe deposit boxes placed in each room to store guest valuables.

At Asia Leisure we greatly value your feedback and have made improvements where relevant.

Terrible experience: way out of town, sloppy service and thieving staff 

We booked a 3-night stay over the Christmas holiday after reading raving reviews. What a disappointment! Tamarind Hill is one of the most expensive hotels in Galle and not worth the money. There are better options in town. 

If you have seen the ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" movie, this place is reminiscent of the hotel as an old ruin, definitely past its heydays. Snapshots can look great but do not let them deceive you: this hotel is a disappointment.  

A few facts worth mentioning. Tamarind Hill hotel is:

- 4 km away from Galle historical fort. It's a lonely compound next to swamp and no man's land. There is a stadium under construction next door that will be finished in 2-3 years. Hotel staff has to call every time a tuktuk (rickshaw) that takes 10-15 min to arrive

- spoilt by a telecom tower installed right in the middle of the premises. If you like strong radiations, you will be served

- plain derelict, once you start paying attention to details. The fish pond in the courtyard didn't have enough water and  fishes were dying. There's a rabbit hutch which is great for kids (our baby boy loved it) but stinks and is terrible for hygiene as located right next to the kitchen 

- service ranges from nonchalant to terrible. Staff speaks poor English. Expect to wait for everything and repeat a lot. 

Now for the worst part: hotel staff stole my wedding ring which I had left in the room. I never misplace it. The hotel manager proved inflexible and even rude. He refused to pay us back when we asked to leave (entire stay was prepaid) and service quality deteriorated even further. I filed a complaint with the local police who came to interrogate hotel staff. 

Overall, a terrible experience that completely spoiled an otherwise fantastic holiday in Sri Lanka.

The bathroom was a banned territory for us. But this isn't all... the bed was full of yellow ants, and they were so many we could't get rid of all of them. The bed sheets were changed, and still at night ants again.. needless to say it's impossible to sleep.

Sorry for the late reply as I have had to do some fact finding on my own before responding to this. We are extremely sorry that you had to go through this. 

The tuk tuk prices are very unregulated in Sri Lanka specially when you are away from Colombo the price disparities becomes much worse as most of the tuk tuk have no meters.. 
 
I am surprised and glad that  you were able to obtain the rate of Rs 100/-  for an almost 5 km trip as even me as a local would not be able to obtain a rate like this. 

The reason the rate you pay at the hotel is higher is because we provide drivers who are reliable and driver who are known to us. By hopping into a tuk tuk by the side of the road we may not be able to give you this guarantee and as a tourist you may be charged much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No 288, Galle Road, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"No 288, Galle Road",,"1477843","6.044482","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.19719","Tamarind Hill by Asia Leisure","952","4.7","6","9","34","127","776","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d1477843-Reviews-Tamarind_Hill_by_Asia_Leisure-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.instagram.com/tamarindhillgalle/","2014-08-05","OTHER","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed here during our honeymoon.

We disliked being quoted extortionate prices. For a ride to Galle Fort, which would have cost around a 100 Rupies, we were consistently quoted 300. When my raised eyebrow didn't even register with him, I explained that I understand how much it should be, to which he blatantly lied, telling me that it was what it was. Whenever we felt comfortable and left the hotel using the services provided by them, we routinely paid 2-3* as much as we did when we came back from the city to the hotel. The same with the 2 hour trip they scheduled to the mangrove lagoon. They charged us an exorbitant sum (locally speaking) for a dingy little boat with a guide who hardly spoke any English. He was nice enough, but for this much money, I would have expected a luxury cruise with some extras like a buffet. It's not the money that annoys me, it's that they don't treat you as guests, but as targets for their schemes.

I'm sure you'll also be told by them that the prices are what they are. Do yourself a favour.

The Good
- Beautiful hotel, very relaxing atmosphere nice furniture and layout
- Having a choice of restaurants so we could get out of the heat of the evening
- Response email booking. Very polite

The Bad
- The food was average at best. We were forced to choose from a set menu. None of the food was really Sri Lankan
- When it arrived the food it was in general tasteless and just not what were expecting from a place of this calibre. 
- Service was terribly slow. Took almost 2.5 hours to complete the meal
- The debacle came at the end of the meal when we came to split the bill. Tip: if you eat here pay in cash and definitely don't use AMEX as they have to phone through each card to get an approval. The waiters complete inability to split a bill despite us asking him. Then they couldn't reverse the charges eventhough they had made a mistake and finally them arguing about it amongst themselves for so long that it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered the bill to leaving

The property is a nice place with an excellent swimming pool, although too far from the Fort. As previous reviews mentioned, the location shown on their website is not right. We were greeted by the Manager (on this position for the last 3 months), who asked us about how we had come to know the Tamarind Hill and ended up talking about the latest reviews on Tripadvisor, some of them not too positive, which he considered as ""misunderstandings"" and seemed not too worried about.

We were given Room number 8 (kindly upgraded to a deluxe), very well appointed and with nice colonial furniture. The room had a/c, but not the bathroom, which had decorated and opened windows, without mosquito screen. This meant that all the time the bathroom was full of mosquitoes and kind of a sauna. Please take into account that the Hotel is next to a swamp, which involves wet land around, and breeding zone.

We had two dinners at Tamarind, and the food was very good. As a surprise we were offered a chocolate anniversary cake. All in all, nice, but not genuine, compared to the sincere smiles you get all around Sri Lanka. 

The worst surprise was still to come...we were bitten by BED BUGS, unbelievable at a place like this. We got plenty of painful bites during the night which lasted for the whole of our trip. Stay away, at least, from Room 8.

Last but not least, and as previous reviews, we had problems with the transport. On our arrival, we asked them to arrange a tuk tuk for us to Town, and we were charged 400 RP, on our way back, we paid 150 RP. We also made arrangements with them for a van transfer from Galle to our next destination in Yala. We forgot something in the car (handicraft), and we didn't get much assistance from them. We never recovered the package.

We explained that we had a booking and showed our voucher and he said ""We don't have any rooms, you've been moved to a place in Hikaduwa"" (25km away). We asked why we weren't contacted and he just said ""Not our problem, speak to Agoda"". I told him his attitude stunk and we were hustled out onto the street to avoid upsetting the other guests.

We spoke to the Managing Director who explained that his manager seemed rude because he'd been living in Dubai (??????) and he explained he couldn't help but wanted to apologize ""on behalf of Sri Lanka"". I explained that Sri Lanka was not the problem, his hotel was.

They proceeded to lie to us, first stating that they'd never heard of us. I replied ""how do you know where our booking has been transferred to?"". They then changed the story to the booking being changed 3 months ago. I asked why they confirmed our booking a week ago and they changed their story again to it was changed that morning.

A wedding party had taken over the hotel and it was obvious that a couple of extra guests had turned up so we were bumped. Entirely unacceptable.

Luckily there had been 2 cancellations at the Lighthouse next door otherwise we'd have been stuck out on the street with no accommodation. Essentially we paid for 2 rooms we never recieved and are still to get our money back.

I'm sorry to hear about your disappointing experience at the hotel. It sounds like the miscommunication regarding the balcony been available significantly affected your stay, and the staff's response may not have been satisfactory. It's understandable that you expected a balcony for smoking purposes, especially given the hotel's positioning as a non-smoking hotel.

We have immediately taken measures to rectify this communication issue for our 2-bedroom apartments. Due to this oversight, we too were unaware that such had been mentioned in our marketing communication, and if we had known that you were keen on the balcony for smoking purposes, we would have written to you and communicated it clearly. 

Due to the hotel been a non-smoking hotel we do have the roof top terrace area and ground floor open area for smoking purposes. however we still don't encourage smoking with the hotel premises as we are positioned as an exclusive non-smoking hotel. 

Once again please accept my sincere apologies for the oversight in our marketing communication and looking forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven.

Ayubowan (May you live long)!

Save your mind and money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am compelled to write this review due to the appalling experience I had at Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7. This establishment has set a new low for false advertising and customer service. I booked my stay based on the promise of a room with a balcony, as clearly advertised. To my utter dismay, upon arrival, I found that there was no balcony. This outright lie was the first of many disappointments.

When I raised this issue with the hotel staff, they had the audacity to blame booking.com, claiming it was an error on their part. This excuse is not only unacceptable but insulting. It is not my responsibility to deal with their advertising mistakes. The hotel had ample time—over a month, in fact—to inform me of this error, but chose not to. Their lack of communication and accountability is inexcusable.

The situation worsened when I realized the implications of their deceit. As a smoker, I was forced into the highly inconvenient position of having to travel from my room to the ground floor every time I wanted to smoke. The hotel's so-called solution was laughable and insulting. They suggested that they open the room window instead and then had the nerve to ask me to sign a waiver stating that opening the window was my request, absolving them of any responsibility. When I insisted they amend the waiver to truthfully reflect that this was their suggestion, not my request, they flatly refused. 

The level of unprofessionalism and sheer lack of empathy displayed by the staff was staggering. There was not a hint of an apology or genuine attempt to rectify the situation. Instead, they were dismissive and uncooperative, leaving me to deal with the consequences of their false advertising and poor service.

This experience was, without a doubt, the worst I have ever had at any hotel. The deceptive practices, lack of accountability, and dreadful customer service at Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7 are beyond unacceptable. I strongly urge potential guests to steer clear of this establishment. Save yourself the frustration, inconvenience, and sheer disappointment I endured. Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7 is a prime example of how not to run a hospitality business, and their actions should serve as a warning to anyone considering a stay here.","Appalling Experience at Jetwig Hotel Colombo 7- Deceptive Advertising and Terrible Service","2024-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r955486964-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Firstly, please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused at checkout regarding the payment. This is not the Sri Lankan hospitality experience we would want our guests to experience at check out. 

As mentioned at time of check in, we had not received any payment from MakeMy Trip for your reservation. As MakeMy Trip is a third-party website located in India, we were following up desperately with MakeMy Trip regarding your reservation and payment, daily with no response from the third-party online agent. As mentioned to you on arrival, we would be charging direct from you at time of check out, if MakeMyTrip had not made the payment, and once the third-party online agent makes payment to the hotel, we will immediately refund your payment. We have been cautioned by all online agents regarding compromised credit cards and asked to follow strict procedures as stipulated by them with regards to payments. 

After your checked out, we have constantly followed up with MakeMy Trip regarding your payment. As we have written to you, we will immediately refund your payment once MakeMy Trip makes payment. Once again, we sincerely apologize for this inconvenience which was beyond our control due to the reservation been made by a third-party website located out of Sri Lanka.    

I would also like to apologize regarding the room and my engineering team has taken immediate action to rectify the issue. Further while we have only received positive comments on our breakfast buffet spread and quality of items and service, I would really like to hear your feedback in detail, so that I could understand what further items we need to have on the buffet that will suit your palate. I would appreciate if you could write to me direct on ajantha@jetwinghotels.com

Once again please do accept our sincere apologies regarding the inconvenience. We would appreciate if you provided us with a second chance to show you the true Sri Lankan hospitality that we are famous for. Please do not hesitate to make the booking with me direct so that I can ensure there is no repetition of the previous incident. 

Looking forward to welcoming you again back to Jetwing Colombo Seven Hotel.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. We thank you for your remarks and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven for your stay.

Please accept our sincere apologies with regards to the inconvenience caused due to the adjoining room guests playing music. We have investigated the matter with our security department, and they have mentioned that the guests had left the hotel after we had advice them of the noise, but have come back in the morning again. We take priority in informing all guests on arrival that the hotel does not tolerate any sort of loud music even though its a festive season. 

It is our focus to ensure that all guests do feel comfortable during this festive season. Our banquets and conference halls are having festive events during this festive season, however the noise travels only to the lobby level and not to any rooms due to the sound proofing that is been done. Further all music must stop at 11pm as per every contract signed with every event.  

I have had a discussion with the training manager and planned to have a training for all newly recruited associates.
 
We hope you will give us a second chance, to experience our standards and not let this isolated incident keep you away. 

Looking forward to welcoming you to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

Thank you for taking the time on the phone to discuss certain issues you had experienced and please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused.  

As discussed over the phone there are Poya days  and certain other days that the government of Sri Lanka has restricted sale of alcohol in the whole of Sri Lanka. As mentioned Jetwing Hotels operate as per the regulations set by the government of Sri Lanka. However as mentioned by you we will talk to relevant authorities to see if this can be relaxed for hotels only in the country. 

We understand that you did not want any disturbance in the room during the sink block, and as discussed on the phone we will look at how we can communicate to guests who don't want to be disturbed of how to drain the water in the sink.

As discussed we will also brief guests that due to Sri Lanka been a tropical country, if you leave the window open then mosquitos can enter the room hence to keep the windows close at all times to avoid mosquitos.   

We are also happy to learn that as per our conversation, nothing mentioned was serious and given as feedback only.

I would like to inform you as we have done during our many mail correspondence that ‘getaroom.com’ is a 3rd party online digital platform who operated individually and has no link to the official hotel website ‘www.jetwinghotels.com ‘and the booking engine URL starts with https://booking.jetwinghotels.com/getavailability?.

The hotel has not received any payment for this booking. However, our e-commerce team has managed to get in touch with ‘Agoda.com’ who has agreed to refund the money to ‘getaroom.com’ since this 3rd party platform has made the booking with ‘Agoda.com’.

While you have paid ‘getaroom.com’ who in return paid ‘Agoda.com’ who currently has your money, based on our correspondence with ‘Agoda.com’ they will refund the money to ‘getaroom.com’. As per our correspondence you will need to contact the 3rd party platform which you claim is ‘getaroom.com’ to refund your money. Our many attempts by the e-commerce team to contact ‘getaroom.com’ has failed and while we will support you and try to contact ‘getaroom.com’, we would like to request you try and get in touch with the 3rd party platform you claim to have book which is ‘getaroom.com’

Over 40 emails back and fourth and Jetwing have still not resolved it. They have no idea where my money is and now are not even responding to my emails! Their staff lack professionalism, customer service and the ability to investigate issues in a timely manner. Money doesn’t grow off trees for anyone and $1400 AUD is huge money for me.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. We thank you for your remarks and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven for your stay.

Please accept our sincere apologies with regards to the high-tea experience.  

I have had a discussion with the kitchen team and the chef with regards to the range of the vegetarian items and  presentation to ensure consistency. 
Further I have also discussed with the food and beverage team to work towards an efficient service.
  
Thank you once again for your feedback, so that we can take corrective measure to ensure such is not repeated. 

Looking forward to welcoming you to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven for your stay. 

We are delighted to learn that you enjoyed the breakfast selection and the roof top infinity pool along with the food and drinks at Ward7 bar. I will be sure to pass on your kind words to the kitchen team. 

It is heart breaking to hear that you did not like the location of the hotel, as this is our main strength and preference of all guests who stay with us. The many cafés and restaurants located around the hotel, with the exclusive shopping malls and proximity to all business and corporate locations. However, I totally understand if sea front beach properties might be your preference. 

We are running at very high occupancy, and this could be mainly due to the Christmas rush. Your feedback is well noted, and I am discussing with the elevator company to understand if we could increase the speed of the elevators as it can add to wait time when the hotel is very high in occupancy. 

As the hotel offers complimentary unlimited WIFI this can be slow when occupancy is very high, as many of the guests tend to be using for various reasons. However, there is also a paid service that is very much faster even during high occupancy. I have also spoken with my housekeeping team to make sure that all hair dryers are plugged in before the room is released, as some guests tend to remove it from the bathroom socket. 

We try our best to offer early check in based on availability and due to very high occupancy it can be difficult to offer check in before the standard time of check in which is 1400hrs. 

I would like to sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused and would very much appreciate if you could give us a second chance to make things right. Also, would appreciate if you could make the booking directly through me at ajantha@jetiwnghotels.com so that I can personally attend to your reservation.  

Thank you again for your feedback and only by such feedback that we can focus on areas for improvement.  
Looking forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

Ayubowan (May you live long)!

Minuses - not a good choice for a business traveler. Poor location, Wi-Fi slow as molasses. Friendly but generally clueless staff. Checkin took forever (5 people behind the counter, lots of paper shuffled, still took 45 minutes…), exactly what the traveler needs after a 11 hour flight and an almost 1 hour ride from the airport. Bathroom stank (open drain?) - they couldn’t/wouldn’t address (Opening the bathroom door took superhuman strength - what is with that?). Hair dryer didn’t work - oddly enough, there wasn’t enough a compatible power outlet for the thing in the bathroom, had to use one in the room to discover that! Figured the place was at 40 % occupancy when I went - elevators took forever to show, shudder to think of wait times when their tourist season begin. Bonus: I could see the grotesque artichokey monument/tower out of the window!
Conclusion - I wouldn’t stay here again.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. We thank you for your remarks and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven for your stay.

Please accept our sincere apologies with regards to the inconvenience caused with your room. I have also been in contact with your family and have apologized personally for the inconveniences. They did mention that while the other 2 rooms had no issues it was your room that encountered all the inconveniences. 

We had spoken to the guests next to your room and have explained the inconveniences you had to go through during your stay. Further we have also ensured to make it very clear at check in to our guests that we are 100% non-smoking hotel, and we expect all guests to adhere to this non-smoking policy.      

I have also spoken to the housekeeping manager and Engineer. We have got the electrical company to replace the electrical switch panel in the room and rest assured this has now been fixed. 

We have briefed food and beverage team to explain to our guests regarding the organic healthy rice we serve, which are grown at our very own Jetwing Kaduruketha hotel. Also, to ensure that the Basmati option is always available for any guest who wish to not experience the organic rice.  

While we continuously focus on training and development your valuable feedback will help us understand the areas that require further training.

We hope you will give us a second chance, to experience our standards and not let this isolated incident keep you away. 
Looking forward to welcoming you to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

I saw many people( more than 8 people) going inside of the room. I complained many times but ending up by changing to another room. 
Again had to change the room because of the electricity problem at 1 am. The lights are not turning off. They didn’t check the room before and found a bin with full of rubbish inside of the bathroom. 
Another thing is the foods. The foods are not delicious. I had 2 fried rice with different type of rice, not basmati. This is the one and only restaurant that i saw a fried rice without basmati. 
Most of the foods in their menu was not available. 
Waiters are serving well, had to ask many time to fill water and get some other stuff. They were gathering in one place and talking each other and very rude ( language wise)

We loved all stays but Jetwing colombo 7 is worst of the lot. Mainly we checked in due to the current power outage in the country and we both had to work the next day.

To start with the reception was so unfriendly. They were not polite at all and sounded like they paid the our room charges.

Rooms needed to be soundproof. Our room number was 302 and there was adjoining room to it. Which was making loud noises through out the night. Really need to sound proof the rooms! This was disturbing in the most disgusting manner as we heard all unwanted noises to our room while we were working.

Room wife was horrible too.

We were asked to go to the rooftop for dinner. Firstly the staff at the rooftop restaurant did not know that any of the in-house guest were coming for dinner. They asked us to make a reservation! After about 20mins we were given a couch to have dinner. Anyways after ordering it took 1 hour and 30 mins for us to get the food.

Same thing happened at the breakfast buffet. They did not have a table for us. 

I do understand you guys accommodate external guest for various reason but don't you think in house guest should get priority? Or simply don't provide the half board option to in-house guests.

I have never experienced this in any Jetwing hotel. 

Furthermore, receptionist asked leave the room sharp at 12 in a very harsh manner as the hotel is fully booked.

We have always wanted to stay for longer at any Jetwing hotel however here we wanted to get out asap.

I highly regret choosing Colombo 7.

The dish was SO SALTY it was inedible after a couple of spoonfuls. When I informed the serving staff he took my dish saying (we will check) then came back with the same pieces of chicken served on some plain samba rice 🤣🤣

Although it was just an overnight stay to attend another function chose this imaginings it’s a typical Jetwing Hotel, full of hospitality. 
No I was absolutely wrong. All started right away at the checking in. The tall dark gentleman who came to welcome suggested me to go to the car park and take the lift straight up so it’s easy for (me or them?) to handle the luggage. I had to remind I didn’t even have a key or room number.
Checking in counter again just ordinary. I had to go to them and keep standing till they finished documentation. No welcome drinks, nor hot or cold towels.
Restaurant the next morning was horrible again. No one welcomed. We chose our seats. No one smiled. No one talked. Only the guy who brought tea was at least smiling, but he offered tea with the salad.

Most unfriendly Jetwing ever and it’s not “Jetwing “. I say this because I have been to Sunrise twice, Light house and Kaduruketha .","Not A Typical Jetwing ","2019-09","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r714651420-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your valuable feedback with us.

Its truly saddening to learn that you did not have a comfortable stay with us with regard to the security measures and confusion over the reservation.

We deeply regret that we fell short in our service and were unable to provide you with the experience we pride ourselves on. 

The points highlighted by you are understandably quite disconcerting. I have taken a careful note of your comments and have initiated the necessary steps to ensure that such incidents are not duplicated with any of our guests in future. I assure you that your recent experience was certainly not reflective of our usual Jetwing standards which we are known for.

Be assured that at Jetwing Hotels, guests’ safety and security is looked after with utmost priority.

I request you to treat this incident in isolation and give us another chance to make up for this experience of yours by visiting us once again and allow us to serve you better.

Ayubowan (May you live long)!

- despite the bombing in Sri Lanka there was a Arabic family with toy machine guns whom pointed the guns towards my friend in the elevators and in the corridor - it had lazar pointer on - this is not acceptable . The hotel staff didn’t seem to care 
- the security was not good . Didn’t even scan the bags
- our check in took 1 hour . The staff couldn’t even find the booking and ontop of that mixing up the booking eg two rooms to one 
- on trying to extend again the staff were mixing up the bookings , clearly amateurs

Given the recent problems in Sri Lanka this is not acceptable

The jetwing need to do better both for safety and customer service

La décoration des chambres manque cruellement de goût.. mais c’est effectivement une histoire de goût.

Le service
Le personnel est très gentil est accueillant mais pas au niveau attendu pour le prix payé.
De plus on avait demandé à l’hotel de nous réserver des billets de train pour un voyage 2eme classe reserved seats. Il nous ont facturé une somme indécente pour le service rendu et nous n’avons pas obtenu les billets demandés. Ce qui nous a laissé la désagréable impression de nous être fait flouer.
Nourriture du restaurant et du petit déjeuner de faible qualité et sans saveur. La viande est souvent trop cuite.
Dans l’ensemble, le prix demandé pour cet hotel est beaucoup trop élevé pour le niveau de service délivré.

It is because we had to charge him twice for breakfast. The client ordered a takeaway breakfast for 3 people for their early morning excursion. When they returned back to the hotel later in the morning they had also joined the breakfast buffet. It is standard practice to offer 1 breakfast for 1 person and not 2 breakfasts for 1 person. They were charged by the hotel staff for the additional breakfast hence the disappointment.
Further this customer had used bad language on our staff for having charged them for breakfast which is not by any means acceptable at our hotel and was requested to apologies to our staff, which he had later apologies for. Our staff speak clear and fluent English and they are veterans in the hotel trade.
Our resort does not need air-conditioning as it is in the hill country which is naturally cool and with plenty of breeze. If one feels a bit humid, we have fixed a fan in the room and each room has four windows. We take pride in our resort being owned by a Srilankan and our resort is currently rated as one of the top resorts in Sri Lanka.  We are not sure what he means by 5 beds for 25 guests when we have 12 Cabanas and can sleep minimum of 24, clearly this reviewer is mudslinging at the hotel for being caught out for what he was trying to do on the sly.

Manage your expectations though. Staff speak bad english and the food is average quality. Breakfast is served very slowly and staff are not on point.

The cottages are not airconditined and bathrooms are smelly at times. Again, the photo’s look amazing but the true reality is a hotel that does not meet the mark on the quality you would expect for the room prices charged.

Also take into account take it takes a 1 hour drive to Ella so you will be in the middle of no where. Also take into account that there are no villages or whatsover connected to this place.
It is ok for a 1 night stay but don’t do more because its way to isolated to get around. Several guests had regrets they booked for 2 nights plus.

Due to bad english communication is hard. This is a sri lanka run hotel so don’t expect a Bali vibe. Pool was not cleaned and cold. Also much smaller then shown on the pictures and only 5 beds for at least 25 guests.

I would like to inform you that our resort is a luxury boutique hotel and we have standards and policies that our hotels adopts specially during Covid days. There are few points that we have to inform you.

1. Kindly note that our resort is operating at full capacity and the standard check-in time is 2 PM and checkout at 12 Noon. On the 28th we were fully booked therefore we could give you only 1 hour late checkout as we need to fully sanitize the rooms and leave for 1 hour before we check-in another customer (Due to Covid)

2. Our resort is only for residents and we do not entertain outside guest/walk-in during these Covid days as we can minimize the risk of Covid to our resort and the neighboring small village close to our resort. There is high risk of Covid spread in Sri Lanka and we as a top end resort consider the Covid risk our utmost importance in protecting our customers and our staff. If your boyfriend had to come and visit you from the outside, you need to get permission as like any walk in guest. This is standard policy in a top boutique hotel due to Covid-19.

3. Our resort manager had already given you a call and discussed your feedback further and explained to you our circumstances and operational procedures.

If there is any inconvenience cause to you we regret it and our Residence Manager had already apologized for the miscommunication and misunderstanding.

It seems that you are aggrieved, simply because you were denied a refund for a cancellation when checking into the hotel, and therefore determined to find fault where possible. 
I seriously dispute your claim that the “drainage system is a disaster”. This is a Heritage Property, and whilst some of the showers maybe slow to drain due to narrow gauge pipes, it is hardly a disaster. The shower did not flood, it just took time to drain. 
With regards to the trains, we are totally transparent about the proximity of the railway line - we even have a video with the train going past the hotel on the home page of our website. The trains do not run all night, and as you can see from the many other flattering reviews, guests view this as a bonus and not something negative. Clearly you did not do your homework.
For someone who claims to be from the industry, you should know that when making a booking, you enter into a contract with a hotel, and that there are terms and conditions attached. These are included in the invoice sent you when you made the booking. Our cancellation policy is fairly standard throughout the industry, and as a boutique hotel with a small inventory, we cannot afford not to stick to those terms. 
You asked to cancel one room and reduce two nights from another room booking, and all of this on the day of arrival. For you to expect us to agree to this with no charge is unreasonable – we are unlikely to sell the rooms and therefore this is a loss for us. We simply asked you to pay 50%. Perhaps if you had asked nicely, instead of bullying my staff, we might have been more amenable to your request. As it is, to vent your spleen you have written this review whilst still in the hotel since you had asked for late checkout, which we have agreed to free of charge. Seems no good turn goes unrewarded!

George Cooper","4032","766722548","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b3/41/f4/caption.jpg","3024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"138 18 - 138/22 Galle Rd, Bentota 80500 Sri Lanka","Bentota","Sri Lanka","80500",,"138 18 - 138/22 Galle Rd",,"1637352","6.414413","Bentota, Galle District, Southern Province","79.99899","The Villa Bentota by KK Collection","737","4.6","17","11","23","130","556","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297895-d1637352-Reviews-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.kkcollection.com/","2024-10-04","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","2","Cleanliness","1","Service","3","Sleep Quality","1",,,"I had high expectations for this “heritage property,” but unfortunately, it was a letdown.

The worst part, though, is the location. It’s right next to train tracks, and let me tell you, good luck getting any sleep with trains roaring past at all hours. If you’re after peace and tranquility, this is definitely not the place.

Now, be very careful when booking because the cancellation policies are extremely strict. They seem far more focused on squeezing every penny out of their guests than actually providing good service. Despite the hotel being barely 30% full, there’s zero flexibility or consideration. Don’t expect any understanding from management either—George, in particular, made sure that every detail of their penny-pinching policies was enforced to the letter, leaving no room for discussion.

It’s unfortunate to say, but the KK Collection seems more interested in protecting their bottom line than in ensuring guests have a pleasant experience.","Disappointing Experience at The Villa Bentota by KK Collection","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r972532846-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your review and your comment which are duly noted.

With regards to the train, I am guessing you booked on Booking.com, because we do not mention the proximity of the station on our website. As a hotel we are limited to simple facts on their website but we are completely transparent about how close the railway line is to the hotel - we have a video on the homepage showing the train passing the hotel - I dont think we could be any clearer on this.  Obivcoulsy we cannot move the railway line, and nor do we hide the fact that it runs past the end of the garden.

We have noted your comments regarding the spa and am sorry that you were disappointed by the service provided.  The lighting is soft, since you hardly want clients to be blinded by the overhead lights when having a massage!! 

We will endeavour to improve the service, especially in the spa.

With best wishes,

Firstly though the hotel staff were amazing here and they cannot be faulted (except the spa employee) for any negative reviews.  The food was lovely and the restaurant staff who looked after us during our stay, although young were very friendly and attentive.  We had water brought out to our sunbeds during the day without request,  and even watermelon one of the days.  If you were to eat in the restaurant the prices were higher than most we saw, and the drinks including alcohol were amount the most expensive - twice the price of some of the other places we stayed in our trip.

The building itself was beautifully constructed and lots of thoughtful chill out areas.  However it stopped there.  The rooms were quite worn round the edges and needed updating, the doors didn't close properly and although our room was clean enough it was basic and not luxury at all.  The high standards from some of the other hotels we stayed in left us very disappointed which was a shame as we were here for 4 nights.  

One of the main issues for us, which I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews I've glanced at (surprisingly) was the train track.  Online it very cleverly says the train STATION is 6km from the hotel.  What it doesn't say is that the TRACK is right behind the swimming pool with the crossing with access to the outside track (no security).  If you planned on a chilled, relaxed time by the pool be prepared for a train go past honking it's loud horn and blasting out a lot of toxic smoke and pollution.  The track was so close to the hotel that when we were in our room at night the windows would rattle with the force of the train going past, and the sound of the horn kept waking us up.   The only time we had respite was between 12.30-4am 3.5 hours of no service!!

We also had a very bad experience of the ""Spa and Wellness centre"".  For starters, it shouldn't be called this.  It was a dimly lit room with a table in the middle of it.  The towel on the bed was a pool towel, and the worker there didn't have a clue about the treatments he was giving.  Reflexology was more like a very painful sports massage - and the manicure was a very painful massacre of the nails - it was so bad we had to walk out the treatments.  The equipment that was being used was old and worn, the nail file had rust on it.  When I asked for the treatment to stop the employee got angry and confused, I told him he was hurting me but he told me to sit back down, I immediately left and reported it to reception.  The manager didn't really do much except apologise and tell us we didn't need to pay for the ""treatments"".  I would not recommend the spa at all.

Sadly, we wouldn't choose to stay here again, and just make sure you check any hotels along this strip as they all pretty much back onto the noisy train line!

It is a shame that you did not mention some of your issues whilst staying at the hotel; and instead you have used this public forum to vent your displeasure.

This hotel was the most expensive hotel of the 10 5 star hotels we stayed in during our 18 night tour of Sri Lanka in February 2024.  It was also one of the most rustic, primitive and lacking in luxury.  As such it truly was the poorest value for money.  Maybe other guests were seeking a different type of experience from a hotel that boasts on its website 'contemporary styled', 'boutique hotel', 'extensive renovation ..... affordable luxury' and more.  The accurate word that is used is 'heritage' for which read basic and very worn at the edges as the buildings are very old.  What's more we are fans of Geoffrey Bawa's architecture and visited several of his highest regarded properties, including other hotels.  We clearly had different expectations.  

If you are a mozzie magnet, this is not the hotel for you - or maybe not the room we stayed in, 'four'.   It had 3 doors directly to the outside from the bedroom, none of which closed well.  The bathroom was entirely open to the elements on one side, letting in not just the mozzies but all manner of other flying or crawling bugs and creepie crawlies, too.  It was the only place where I got bitten, despite using the provided mosquito net over the bed.  

This room also had no privacy because directly outside the window was a lawn that had staff passing as they tended to the grounds and other guests strolling by constantly.  Worse, it had a direct view from the train.  The blinds need to be fully shut owing to their design, so you get no daylight or face being on display.    

How other guests can consider the train an interesting feature is beyond me.  Maybe they do not get woken by a train that runs until midnight and then starts up at 4:30 in the morning, tooting loudly as it noisily trundles by.  Take your own earplugs; none were provided in the room.

For a luxury, boutique hotel the security is a joke.  There's a charade about exclusivity to gain access from the road, cars need to toot and drivers explain themselves to a security guard to open the huge metal gate to gain entry.  Yet the back of the hotel is open to anybody who walks along the train line - many villagers seem to commute daily or just stroll along this way - and there is full access to anybody from the beach which can be reached by the general public.  One nosy guest from a neighbouring hotel just wandered in thinking it might be a restaurant, so anybody can do the same.

We were told with great fanfare about their beachside sunset tiki bar.  As the hotel provides no loungers on the beach in front of the hotel and just erects a make shift bar to serve a limited range of over priced and strange cocktails, this is a huge missed opportunity.  The first guests bagged the 2 chairs or sat on a few tree stumps, the rest of us stood up looking like idiots with nowhere to rest our drinks.  Given the small, boutique hotel emphasis, they could even have made more of the feature, even created a setting for guests to meet each other.

The food was OK, but the menu is very short and there was an emphasis on 'western' dishes.  If you wanted local food, you had to request this well ahead, and then the choices were limited.  Despite other reviewers stating they could choose off menu if nothing suited, nobody mentioned this at any meal to us.   

The staff was the best feature.  There were many of them, and they did seem to aim to please.","Overpriced, underwhelming","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r941541885-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I should like to point out that Jaggery Beef is, by nature, a spicy dish, so perhaps this was not the best choice for you. Having said that, the kitchens omitted to add chilli, as requested, but they did use cardamom and cumin, otherwise this would not be Jaggery beef!

I am perplexed as to your comment about the staff making jokes - they are very professional, and unless you speak fluent Sinhala, I totally fail to understand how you thought something they had said was a joke.

The Villa Bentota dates back to 1880, and is not a purpose built hotel, so frankly your comment about the corridors does not warrant a response.

Very rude and unwelcoming staff. Untrustworthy manager.

I was traveling over the South coast with my brilliant mum and I wanted us to have a nice and relaxing rest during our last night in The Villa Bentota on 21 January. I know the brand very well as long as I used to come very often to Tintagel in Colombo and I have never been disappointed before. From the first minute of our arrival to The Villa Bentota premises I didn’t feel a nice welcoming. When I parked my car the security person didn’t guide me where it’s better to park. The receptionist was standing at the entrance but he didn’t come to the car to help us with the luggage until I asked him to do so. He looked a bit lost and strange. Didn’t say any welcoming words to us. After entering the reception we immediately heard a strong noises of reparations work coming to the inside. The GM of The Villa showed us around. Finally we approached the small pool where the numerous workers made a very noisy reparation work and we didn’t, however, receive an apology from the GM. When we finally came to take our room the continuous noise was also there. I registered this noise with my phone on the video. This noise was lasting until the end of the day. Next morning before our checking out we were seating near the pool and suddenly the GM asked me to take my car and park it close to the main road telling that in 5 min a big track will block the road for some electrical work and nobody knows for how long. He mentioned that it’s a municipality work and not under the hotel control. But I told him that I’m unhappy that he is telling me that only now and give me only 5 min for that move. While I was in my swimming suit and I didn’t have my car key with me. Normally municipalities inform hotels in advance and the GM also should tell me that in advance and not put me in a stressful situation. I did my best to take my car as quickly as I could but when I driver to the road the track was already there. The workers told me that the track had an accident and can’t move and that we have to wait maybe 3-4 hours until the track reparation is done. We came back to the hotel pool. Suddenly in 10 min a hotel receptionist came to the pool and said that I can go as long as the track was moved. I asked the GM if he is a serious person that he arrange such a stressful situations for his guests and he is not capable to organize a good coordination with local municipalities? As a GM he should be near the track to get an exact information to transfer it to his guests! But he was completely irresponsible! Upon my return to Colombo I contacted the Paradise Road CEO and I was politely explaining our displeasure and disappointment with our stay at the property and how much I like his other establishments such as Tintagel and Gallery Cafe. He contacted The Villa GM and he told me that GM only mentioned the problem with a track on 22 January. GM didn’t want to tell the truth to the CEO that during all the day of 21st the continuous noise of reparations was disturbing the guests and preventing them to relax near the pool and in their rooms. It’s a shame for the image of such a reputable and one of the best Srilankan establishment hotel! As a hotel guest in this situation we may receive compensation for an unsatisfactory stay which ruined our experience. But unfortunately I still didn’t receive any email until now even after talking to CEO with a considerate offer regarding this matter.","Most disappointed experience in years.

However, the price we paid for a 'standard room' at this hotel was not proportionate to the rest of the accommodation we experienced in Sri Lanka and we were left feeling incredibly disappointed with the experience in this hotel. 

Whilst we booked a 'standard double' which boasted many features according to the hotels main website, our room did not resemble this, when discussed with the manager we were told this was because booking directly a 'standard' was of a better quality than booking through an agent, the website at best then misleading.

We were allocated a room right above the bar/restaurant area, it was very open which meant that it was possible for the hotel guests to see me walking from the shower to the wardrobe (as the wardrobe was outside the main room on a suspended floor above the communal area). This is totally humiliating and degrading for women (and of course men). 

I'm not sure if this room, which felt like we were staying in someone's spare room which usually is an office, was an after thought or a response to a lack of available rooms. However it is significantly below the level of standard I would expect from a boutique hotel and I would recommend that people are very careful where/what they book in this hotel.

We were in Suite One with its own plunge pool - the room is quite dark with no view and also the bathroom lighting isn't very good. We didn't go in the plunge pool as it could have done with being skimmed over with a net before our arrival as there was some trees foliage on it. Otherwise the hotel is very beautiful. 

Unfortunately our holiday turned sour on our last day. We'd left our room that morning and were given a small room next to the pool and above reception to shower in before our flight. I left the pool at 5pm to shower and when I came out my husband & 2yr old son were still happily by the pool. They came in at 5.30pm to shower. Shortly afterwards staff started fumigating the whole pool area with mosquito fogging. There had been no warning especially considering I'd seen staff members walk past while I was out on the balcony enjoying the sunset.) This filled the entire atmosphere and immediately started coming into the room I was in as they were fumigating right outside. I was 5wks pregnant so panicked as I saw the fumes coming towards our room. I quickly shut the door but it wouldn't shut properly and the fog started coming through every gap and immediately filled the small room. I tried to go out into the landing but there window was just an open frame with no glass so the landing area was filled fog & fumes. 

I ran back in the bathroom where my husband and son were showering and held a towel to my face and we all tried to keep low. I was really scared and concerned at what affect this would have on my unborn baby as well as my young son. 

Once it sounded like the fumigating had finally finished  I waited a few more minutes for the fog to disperse and I flung the doors open and went downstairs to speak to the receptionist. I couldn't believe there had been no warning or request to ask us to move to another area of the hotel, particularly as we had a little boy with us. All the receptionist said is he didn't know we were there, he thought we were by the pool. I said how could we be by the pool with all that fogging surrounding the area. 
He told me it's safe (but then men doing it we're wearing large masks). I was close to tears and shaken as I explained what had happened but he didn't see the issue. 
He reluctantly knocked one of our restaurant bills off the final balance which was about £40 (big deal considering the final bill!) 

I've only just found out I'm pregnant and this is supposed to be a happy time but now I'm just scared for my baby and it turned a fantastic holiday into a really sad cause for concern at the end. 

My brother's family had spent their last night in a hotel in Negombo where they had also experienced mosquito fogging but the staff had warned them beforehand and suggested they took my 3yr old niece to another part of the hotel so they wouldn't be affected by it. I can't believe this wasn't the case at Paradise Road Villa.","Mosquito Fogging with no warning","2017-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r457085079-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

One of the A/C's didn't work properly. The tv area (quite a small TV) for the room was not air-conditioned.
We were staying here because we were attending a friends wedding at the hotel. However, even though they charge full price (more than you would pay at a 5 star hotel) they decided that they would not serve food from the only restaurant they have after 2pm.
After paying such a ridiculous amount the least I would have expected was a decent breakfast. However, just like the rusty TV and faulty A/C no corner was left uncut. The breakfast provided with a 600 dollar room is an option of one thing (Villa breakfast, similar to American breakfast). They had a Sri Lankan option which requires notice of 12 hours! Of course no one told us this the previous evening
About 20% of the menu is a notice stating that any extras ordered would be billed at full a la carte price.
So we ordered 4 Villa breakfasts for my wife and I and two children. 2 fried eggs sunny side up, 2 fried eggs over easy, 1 omelette and 1 scrambled eggs. The waiter obviously didn't understand as he brought scrambled eggs instead of the eggs over easy.
When I sent it back another person came and asked if there was a problem. So we said we wanted the eggs overeasy and he said certainly and went back to the kitchen. A few minutes later they bring two fried eggs with the yolks broken and hard. Clearly, their chef does not even know what over easy means.
The sides such as bacon and sausage were also ridiculously small. One 25g sausage or 2 tiny undercooked rashers of bacon.
If you are considering this place please think again! There are far better options with more luxurious facilities, better food and better service available in Bentota at half the price!","Please don't waste your money!","2016-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r416963553-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to write a review on our property on trip advisor. On Christmas Day this year Sri Lanka experienced one of the worst rains in our history. Paradise Road The Villa Bentota was built by the architect Geofrrey Bawa with an aim, as with all his buildings, to embrace nature and the warm climate of Sri Lanka. The humidity you experienced on the walls was particulary due to these unusuallz heavy rains; however we assure you that we have an ongoing budget that allows us to continuously restore any moisture and/or fittings (minus natural patina outdoors which purposely adds to the design of the property).

In regards to in room wifi we aim to encourage our guests to relax during their stay and switch off from technology however due to several requests we are now extending our wifi to all rooms in January 2015. In regards to the refund you requested we apologise this is not possible during our high season.

We apologise for the shortcomings you have faced with our staff, we pride ourselves on our service and have looked into the matter immediately to ensure that all our guests experience the same high standard of service.

Potentially a death trap - the final straw was returning to our room in Christmas Day at 11pm to find it literally seeping water from the walls & ceilings (through electric lights) and spores growing on the walls. It was nightmarish.

Put very simply, the Villa Bentota, Paradise Road could be fabulous, but is suffering from intense under investment and lack of planning to manage a building of its age and character in an extreme tropical climate. 

The staff do well to manage an extremely difficult situation, despite some arrogance (see below) and the fact that they will do their best to hide (but it is understandable as there is nothing they can really do). There is no evidence of a fixtures and fittings allowance from their budget to roll out essential maintenance, and really, at these prices there should be.

I will let my 'candid' pictures of the two suites we stayed in speak for themselves. No filters. Dank, smelly and impossible to get dry. The mould and the smell on the ground floor was indescribable. We moved after one night - and serious histrionics from me - to the room above, which did not smell as bad, but as both rooms had bathrooms with no extraction or proper ventilation (just a tiny foot tall and wide window) it will always be impossible to air and dry these rooms after the use of the shower - let alone the effect of the climate. 

Oh - did I mention the bars on the windows? The subterranean first 'suite' with its basement ceiling glass blocks and the fact that when we checked I we actually thought the glass on the windows was opaque due to condensation?

In addition - no in room wifi. I will leave you to your own conclusions on this. 

Paradise road have several businesses in Colombo, that we have experienced before, and a good reputation. They are doing  serious damage to their reputation by not taking more care of their Bentota property. Sadly, it does seem that the country seems to be suffering from its own success in attracting tourism after the cessation of war and this place really is to be avoided at all costs. 

This is my very first trip advisor review. Why? Because I believe that you should praise a place directly and also critique professionally, and directly. Sadly, this is the very first place that I feel needs to be named and shamed for its poor product. If I had read the terrible and poor reviews on line and had not just looked at the headlines good reviews, I would never have booked it. I have learnt something myself, as the poor and terrible reviews are pretty spot on, if a little emotional. Finally, I am
Posting this as, despite the indisputable evidence that the product is totally substandard, I was told:

'We are number two on trip advisor in Bentota' .

For small boutique - Go to Taru Villas almost next door, Dutch house in Galle, and if they are not available go to a larger hotel with international representation, like the fortress in Galle, but don't go to the villa Bentota. My mother general tip - go to hotels that reply to their trip advisor reviews - good or bad.

I hope this helps anyone in their research from making the same mistake I made. Have a great time in Sri Lanka - it is a wonderful place with great people - just choose your accommodation wisely.","Emperors New Clothes","2014-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r246016766-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We were terribly sorry to hear of your experience in Sri Lanka and that it has resulted in a negative view of Paradise Road The Villa Bentota.

Unfortunately, when you contacted us from Galle 1 week after your departure to complain about a claimed theft by our staff, there was absolutely nothing we could do. We provide safes for all our rooms and advise guests to store all valuables accordingly. 
We can however imagine how disheartening it was to learn that your passport was misplaced and can only be disappointed that this inconvenience now relates to our property. 

Our only recommendation to all travellers, is to store valuables in the safe provided and if not, with you and should you notice anything missing to report it immediately so that something can be done about it. 

We hope to welcome you one day back to our property and reverse your poor opinion of us!

Yours in Service,

My husband and I had so looked forward to this portion of our trip as we had just spent two weeks in India and other parts of Sri Lanka. Bentota was going to be our two days of pure relaxation and peace.

We are American and travel very, very frequently. We both work in the travel industry for leading international travel magazines and review hotels often for our company's print and digital publications. With this said, we have stayed at some of the worlds most exquisite and unique properties, being fortunate to have experienced truly ""the best"" in terms of boutique and luxury travel.

Villa Bentota, in all essence, does not live up to its promise or marketing efforts. It is a stunning hotel with beautiful spaces and and an authentically vintage, antique ambience that I personally love. The design is interesting enough and the grounds are beautifully manicured.

But, unfortunately, once the initial high you get from the beautiful surroundings fades away, you realize that the hotel has a LOT of work to do before it can compete in the international travel market. Sri Lanka is a ""newly discovered"" travel destination for Westerners, and it's beautiful. But, those creating hotels to cater to people who have experienced the best should pay much closer attention to the details.

From the moment of check-in until check-out, we experienced some of the worst service we have ever seen at a hotel promoting itself in this luxury category. Examples...

No one was available for check-in upon our arrival and we had to search for 10 minutes to find someone at 10:00 pm to check us in. The food is wonderful, if they get your order right, but chances are your fresh papaya juice ordered at the beginning of breakfast will arrive at the end. By the pool, you my have to search for someone to bring you towels to use and then ask them again to bring you a drink menu, ask them again to order that drink and search for them to actually get that drink in your hand. It may take them two to three hours to clean up the pool area after someone has left, leaving the chairs and tables looking quite messy and dirty - not the best ambience. 

When you finally get that drink, don't mind the frequent trains bustling by the pool area as the hotel literally just in front of train tracks that take people on the journey from Colombo to Galle. You will have to cross these tracks to go to the beach - which, by the way, has no chairs, towel service or people to ensure your comfort. The wifi in the hotel is very, very spotty so don't bank on it if you have important things to do via internet. Also, don't mind the lack of help when you are lugging your bags from your room to the lobby to check out...those who are supposed to help you are talking amongst themselves while you are struggling.

All in all, I really had high hopes for this hotel. We were so very excited to experience the romance of it. But, the owner, Mr. Shanth Fernando, should definitely focus more on assembling a staff with greater attention to detail than promoting his hotel as the ""it"" destination in Sri Lanka.","Beautiful hotel and idea in theory...horrifically execution","2013-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r156686392-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We booked Executive Suite 1. What can I say... it was damp, dark and with the air conditioning on it was like sleeping on a runway. The 'private plunge pool' was a dank, cold-looking pool with an oily film and leaves floating in it. I wouldn't have gone in it if you'd paid me to.  We explained to the manager that we were very disappointed with the room and asked to be moved, which they accommodated but only after we'd had to spend another two nights in ES1.  The new room (7) was a lower grade of room but so much nicer than the Exec Suite - shared veranda overlooking the gardens with beautiful shutters and light flooding the room.  Unfortunately the air conditioner was just as noisy and we barely slept. 

The food in the restaurant is good but there needs to be more variety. We only stayed for 4 nights and got so sick of looking at the same menu night after night. The restaurant service is dreadful. Staff wander around in a daze, orders are lost or forgotten, barely any English is spoken. And when you're paying $250 a night, being charged for water at dinner is just so stingy.  

There is a lovely bar with an open front looking on to the gardens. It would be such a relaxing place to sit, if only they didn't blast out the same 'Dad Rock' CD. Every. Single. Night.

I had booked two standard rooms and 1 executive suite (suite 3 - this was supposed to overlook the sea, but it didn't coz of the trees). First of all, the bald manager has too much attitude (about what I do not know!). Don't think he has had any lessons in customer service. All the 3 rooms had a musty smell even though it wasn't raining when we stayed there. The first night, I got bitten by 2 bed bugs in about 20 places all over my body. And this was in the executive suite!!!! Called the bald manager at about 2 am. Thankfully he came immediately. Firstly he refused to believe that the red flared up marks all over my body were due to bed bugs. Then when we insisted that he check the bed, he did find two BIG BED BUGS!!!! And you know what his response was upon seeing them - the last guest in this room must have brought these bed bugs with him!!!!!! So does this mean that the room wasn't cleaned after the last guest left??? When I asked him that he was visibly embarrassed and showed us another executive suite. This was smelling badly and the walls were damp. But since it was the middle of the night and I was with a baby, we took that room and tried to sleep. The next morning, he showed us a 3rd suite which was on the ground floor but had a smell of fresh paint as it was painted recently. We told him that we don't mind our original room as long as he cleans the bed properly. He refused saying that the whole room will be thoroughly cleaned, the bed will be removed and replaced etc etc and this will take a lot of time and didn't give us the same room back. So we had to do with the smelly room. During all this, the manager never once offered anything at all as compensation for the bad experience I had. On the last night, we had a late check out and they charged us USD 100 for that. This was already agreed upon but the least they could have done would have been to waive off this charge. Now for the best part - 2 hours after they told us that our bed bug ridden room will be closed and cleaned very thoroughly, they gave that same room to another family!!!!! We were sitting for lunch and we saw another family standing in the balcony and then emerging out of the same villa. So in conclusion, horrible stay, no warmth or consideration from the manager. They are just there to make as much money as possible without providing any real service. And I paid top dollar for this place. The food is good though. Though the waiters seemed to be all in a daze and had difficulty understanding simple requests. The level of English is also poor. Oh yes, one more thing, they treated my driver badly as well and did not provide any place for him to stay.
I went for dinner to The Club Villa on the last night and it was good. How is it as a resort - I don't know. The look and feel of both places is very similar. But one thing I do know is that I have never ever seen a boutique hotel with boutique prices where the management and the staff behave this way. I'll never return.","Bitten badly by bed bugs; inconsiderate manager","2012-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r125625618-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

After the first two, our hopes were high, but were sadly let down. The property is lovely but desperately in need of some TLC. I think they rely far too heavily on the the word ""boutique"" to cover a multitude of sins
 Our first room was very small and dark. We quickly realised that the free WiFi did not work in that room. We were offered another across the hall, which was much brighter, but no larger, and did have some weak WiFi reception ( a must for international travelers). We pointed out that there was no safe in the room, so the staff member went and picked up the safe from the first room and brought it into the new one. Not my idea of a secure place to leave valuables!!!
The pool area was pleasant, but almost entirely in the shade and enveloped in smoke from the surrounding village houses. The pool looked to be in need of a deep clean.
Breakfast was good. The dinners were a set menu ( with some choices) but were expensive by Sri Lankan standards. We were not told that we could have chosen from the lunch menu.
Our room was on the side of the property , above the kitchen. We realised that if we had the shutters open, we could be seen by staff members walking up a path beside the villa, so we had to keep them shut while dressing and changing.
At over £350 a night, I don't think this was good value for money and I certainly wouldn't choose to stay here again.
After reading other poor reviews, I expect a strong rebuttal from the owner who doesn't appear to accept criticism about his  property.","Disappointing","2023-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r877001625-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The query about dinner billing was double-checked,and all was correct.In circumstances when guests  - occasionally but very understandably - for some reason want less for dinner, we typically first offer the option to go with parts of the main set dinner menu at a reduced price.If that is still too much food, we can offer the option of the lunch menu a la carte but typically guests go with the former.

In this case,for 2 out of 3 items each as described, at a cost of Rs 4000 per person.The price structure/reduction for parts of the menu has been the same for many years, without any problems.Wine and bottled water came to an additional Rs 3150,and 10% SC added to the total

We are very sorry that your stay did not feel optimal, and that you did not raise any queries about dinner and drinks billing during your stay when it might have been easier to explain fully in person

The property is beautiful, the staff very friendly, the pool area is superb, and the food is very good.
However, it sells itself as “sublime / restful / oasis of calm”, which sadly it wasn’t. We deliberately returned early one day (just after lunch), to lie by the pool, swim and read a book. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so due to incessant noise from grass cutting and dogs barking next door, which lasted for 4 hours !! A housing development is being built next door, which added to the general mayhem.
The pool is superb, but it is impossible to enjoy without getting eaten alive by mosquito’s and ants.
We knew that this hotel was not “cheap”, but we were very disappointed to find 29% added to our bill at the end (19% tax and 10% Service). As this has not happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka, it is difficult to avoid reaching the conclusion that this is a deliberate pricing strategy.
A shame really, I would love to recommend this hotel for all its good points, but it is hard for me to get past several key negatives.

The information received from your travel agent ahead of your stay was totally incorrect.We have since been in touch with your agent who has sincerely apologised for your negative review and for ""the bad image to your prestigious hotel"",plus appreciated how we helped you by accomodating you over New Year in spite of our policy. 

To further clarify,we do request the ages of guests in advance,and your agent stated you were both adults booked in a double-bed room - we would have queried it months ago at the time of booking if they had mentioned about your grand-daughter - and they had mistakenly only forwarded your ""middle"" name on the confirmation.That explains some questions,consternation and concern on your arrival presenting your unrecognised ""surname"" and with a young child.When the voucher was presented by your driver,the middle name was only then recognised.As you say,you were both welcomed in spite of the errors by your agent,and the management and staff made every effort to look after you in these circumstances throughout your stay.

Also it may be helpful to quote in full your comment in the Guest Book....""A lovely relaxing stay.My grand-daughter (who really is not old enough to stay here) and I have been very well tended to by Janaka.The grounds are glorious,and the rooms are delightful"".

We totally understand that our gourmet 5-course dinner for New Year's Eve would not be appropriate for your grand-daughter.Although encouraged to join the latter evening and fireworks,you mainly chose to stay in your room on your return from Kandy

So to us it feels very harsh that you reciprocated our welcome with such a negative review and the headline ""stay elsewhere"",but partly understand it probably has been prompted by the frustrations of your experience given you would be expecting all to have gone smoothly with your travel agent

We are sorry that a third party incorrectly processed and communicated your booking,and that in some way it made you feel uncomfortable,especially for your young companion - we love children,but for many years have taken the advice of our agent counterparts and the experience of guests(and you will now know the reasons) that it's better suited for children above 12 years-old,a policy regularly communicated to all our counterparts.

I arrived on New Year's Eve with my 7-year-old granddaughter.  When we walked inside with our guide, we were greeted by the manager and a woman who apparently was in charge of reservations.  I never knew exactly what her status there was (nor did I see her again, thankfully), but she was the ONLY PERSON in all of Sri Lanka who treated me rudely.  I was told that under no circumstances were children allowed, to which I responded that my reservations were made many months before by a travel agent who knew the ages of me and my granddaughter.  Again, I was told that no children are allowed, and after being essentially berated for about five minutes, my guide showed this woman a paper of some sort.  Immediately, the mood changed, and we were both welcomed and introduced to our personal ""butler"" (a term I'm totally uncomfortable with), and shown to our room.  

The bedroom was adequate, the sitting room adjoining it was adequate (but not very comfortable), and the dinner was adequate AND expensive.  Jonaka, our ""butler,"" was extremely nice and attentive, as was all the staff, including the manager.  The property is lovely but seemed overly pretentious. I booked the tour as a package, and as a result, I have no idea what I paid for the room we had.

Because I realized that we weren't really welcome at the Kandy House, we stayed in our room the little amount of time that we were actually on the property.  The second night of our two-night stay was New Year's Eve, which featured a 5-course meal beginning at 8 PM, too late for a child and too expensive for us both (8000 rupees each!!!!).  So we ate in Kandy instead.  

We stayed in fabulous hotels during our 10 days in Sri Lanka and were treated royally in them all, with the exception of the Kandy House.  Children were catered to everywhere we went, so it was quite stunning when we were made to feel unwelcome here.  My suggestion for the booking office would be to require the tour company to state the ages of the guests when reservations are made; then the unwitting guests won't be subjected to the cold reception that my granddaughter and I received.","Make another choice","2014-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r190072128-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

To suggest favourable reviews are ficticious just defies all logic and is not respectful to our previous guests,many of whom have remarked that if anything our website underepresents their experiences

Anyway,it's always important to address comments,so our responses are as follows:
1.The experience is meant to be more like staying in a home than an hotel,so we intentionally do not provide telephones,TV,fridges etc in the room.Guests can easily keep items refrigerated in our kitchen,there is a telephone accessible in the office if you wish to make calls,and staff are on hand to serve all your needs
2.Of course we advised against drinking the tap water,that is very common in Sri Lanka and we provide plentiful complimentary mineral water to guests
3. It's an historic building set in 6 acres of garden and woodland with a cast-iron gate both unobtrusive and sympathetic to the property.All hotels have a security guard on hand,anyone would be surprised if there wasn't one although this is just a precaution and we do not experience any problems and we have good relations with the local village.To suggest it's scarey and like a military compound is absurd.The road was under temporary reconstruction,and is now flat and smooth.
4.Yes,we are outside Kandy but typically a drive of only about 20 minutes to the city centre.Our guests appreciate our location away from the bussle of the city,choosing to make trips to visit any sites or otherwise and then relax at the hotel
5.Of course some mosquitoes can be present especially at some parts of the year,but no more than any other part of this tropical country.The ""mozzie bangles"" we provide are really appreciated and are effective,and some guests take them for their onward destination,and comment it's a gem of a gift rarely offered at other hotels.Again,mosquito nets are the norm in so many tropical countries and in Sri Lanka.
6.It's abundantly clear that The Hotel Suisse suited you better,which would begin to explain so many of your comments,and I'm pleased you felt comfortable there.

I think you were expecting something very different,and we have been in conversation with the travel agent as so much clearly did not suit you at The Kandy House.You were  booked into the wrong hotel for you and in your frustration,you seem compelled to post your first and only review on Tripadvisor with some vindictive and extraordinary remarks.

The reality is that you eat outside where a wild bird almost hit us while it was attacking a mirror near the table while the staff did nothing  Other realities for us are:  
1. Our room had no television, no telephone, no internet, no drawer space and no privacy.  The open bathroom facilities and bed were in the same space separated by only a mosquito net.
2. Management  told us not to drink the water.
3. Access to this place is by an almost impassible dirt road filled with gullies and deep holes.  Our driver said you really need a four wheel drive.  The area around it is questionable/scary and to get in, a guard has to be summoned to open a large iron gate.  It is like a military compound.
4. All the tourist destinations are in and around Kandy. It was a grueling hour's drive from there.
5. The area is infested with mosquitos.  Except for the small room we were in, the entire inn is open to the outside---reception areas and rooms, dining, wifi area.  Upon arrival each guest is issued a citronella bracelet that must be worn on the wrist while here for mosquito protection.  The rooms have an electronic repellent distributing device and at night the staff encloses your bed in mosquito netting wherein you must sleep.  In the event of a medical emergency there from allergies or anything, I don't think any help could reach us. 
6. There is NOTHING to do there.  We were booked in for four days.  We left the first morning, but, although the place was one-third empty, they would not give us a refund for the nights we missed. We went to the Hotel Suisse in Kandy for the rest of our stay and it was quite comfortable and civilized.
If you are a young honeymoon couple who don't care about amenities, mosquitoes or touring, but will gaze into each other's eyes all waking hours, maybe you can stay there and ignore everything else.

The hotel's child policy has been in place for over 9 years since opening,and our counterparts are advised of all policies at least annually - additionally and importantly,our confirmation to your agent included a further reminder,and it's stated on our website.It's probably also worth pointing out that we love children,but feedback from guests and experience with agents has consistently been that this policy makes sense  for this type of smaller property,and is not unique even within Sri Lanka (as well as other countries where it does exist for some hotels).

We just cannot make an exception when such a policy exists and others may not be able to stay there as a result,as well as those choosing it for that reason in some cases.When you arrived,all the other guests were either on an excursion or had not yet arrived,and for that period more than half the rooms would have been occupied.

Again,we are sorry this created frustration for you and hope these clarifications address your impressions,and that overall you had a good experience in Sri Lanka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amunugama Walawwa, Kundasale 20270 Sri Lanka","Kundasale","Sri Lanka","20270",,"Amunugama Walawwa",,"589885","7.317384","Kundasale, Kandy District, Central Province","80.68057","Adigar's Manor","875","4.7","7","13","45","149","661","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1199465-d589885-Reviews-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"2013-07-28","OTHER","2","Don&#39;t go with children under 12!","Value","2","Rooms","5","Location","4","Cleanliness","5","Service","3","Sleep Quality","3",,,"We arrived at the hotel (with an 8 year old boy) after hard day's car journeys and sightseeing, and wanted to rest (trying to find this hotel is incredibly difficult and time consuming).

We explored if an exception could be made given the mistake on all sides, and especially as we seemed to be the only guests, but there was no budging on their side.  So reluctantly we went off back to Kandy, and after some exploration, and a guide book we luckily had, we found Helga's Folly, which was even better than the Kandy House (its a spectacular Sri Lankan equivalent of a an old British stately home), and we ended up very happy in Kandy in the end.","Warning - dont go with kids under 12!","2013-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r169421774-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

It's unfortunate for you that you arrived feeling so ill,possibly from the journey or a previous experience on your itinerary.We have never received any negative feedback about our welcome,and we are sorry if this was lost in our immediate efforts to offer a more practical remedy to your obvious discomfort,including offering to organise medical assistance and a local coconut remedy on the premises.These were not accepted,and understandably you were in your bedroom for most of the day of your arrival.Also,we made the smaller lunch menu available to you late in the evening as the vegetarian option on the main menu did not suit you,you enjoying mezze platter with your husband followed by pasta for yourself.

The following day we were keen not to disturb you as you stayed in the room until late morning,when we were happy to serve you breakfast instead of lunch.To clarify the issue with hot water,the regulator had been turned down for a number of previous guests who had mentioned it was too hot,so we just needed to enter the room to access the boiler (receded above the shower area,requiring a ladder) to adjust this,but you and your husband did not wish anyone to enter the room during the whole day,including to clean and make up the room.I hope this did not lessen the chance of us first finding a mosquito under your pillow - all the beds in the hotel have good mosquito nets,and are normally turned down and checked daily.There's an easier way to regulate the air-con system(which was installed last year) via the remote control which can adjust the air direction appropriately.Throughout your stay,we were asked that the staff not go into the room.

We intentionally do not have telephones in every room,although our staff are always available until the last guest goes to bed in case anything is needed.In an emergency,guests are advised to ring the manager in residence on a phone in the common area,close to all the rooms inside the main house, and some lights on the landing and passageway were left on as usual during your stay.

When you had advised us it was your birthday as well as honeymoon,we had planned a complimentary birthday cake,and a bottle of wine,for your enjoyment but omitted to mention this prior to your departure to the perahera,so we are very sorry not to communicate that to you directly.You took your room key with you when you left for the perahara,having said you would return for dinner.Later that night,we received a telephone call from your driver to say you had chosen to have dinner elsewhere in Kandy.That is obviously not a problem,but it's probably important to clarify that on both nights you did not sample either of our main dinner menus.We offer 22 cocktails and mocktails,and are sorry if you did not enjoy yours.

Again,we are very sympathetic if these circumstances,and perhaps some bad luck with an illness on your honeymoon and birthday, combined to make your stay less enjoyable.However,we remain concerned when a guest leaves on a positive note saying they had enjoyed their stay,only to find a ""Poor"" rating appear later with a list of issues.Hopefully we have now clarified some of these,and we are mindful you have complimented the hotel,including the management and staff.

We have just completed a very successful perahera season for so many of our guests,and are again very sorry that some things did not work out well for you.Wishing you and your husband best wishes and happiness throughout your new married life together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amunugama Walawwa, Kundasale 20270 Sri Lanka","Kundasale","Sri Lanka","20270",,"Amunugama Walawwa",,"589885","7.317384","Kundasale, Kandy District, Central Province","80.68057","Adigar's Manor","875","4.7","7","13","45","149","661","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1199465-d589885-Reviews-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"2012-07-27","OTHER","2","We stayed in a delux room and found it way too small.","Value","3","Rooms","2","Location","3","Cleanliness","3","Service","3","Sleep Quality","3",,,"The hotel itself is beautiful - in location, scenery, and design. We stayed here for two nights at the end of our honeymoon and also for my birthday and were initially very excited about staying somewhere so highly rated on Trip Advisor. 

However, my husband and I were both very disappointed with the hotel for several reasons:

- Our welcome was cold and not friendly.

- Hot water only ran for five minutes. To solve this problem required several hotel staff and a very tall ladder to enter our small room to turn on a switch. The switch for the hot water should really have been on prior to our arrival.

- The room had no telephone. To get in touch with the hotel staff we had to use the phone in the communal areas. As all lights are turned off when the last guest disappears into their room, this is not ideal.

- Lunch and dinner menu was very limited, with three options for dinner - none of which during our stay included local cuisine, which we found disappointing.

- While the hotel has an extensive cocktail list, the quality of the cocktails were poor.

- The aircon system is dated, and blows too strongly onto the bed on the lowest setting.

- There was a dead mosquito under my pillow on the first night.

Despite this, we did enjoy our time at Kandy House. The hotel has a good collection of games, which were handy for a relaxing evening. The manager was also very accommodating to our requests regarding dining. The grounds are beautiful, and the staff are polite and always keen to help, although some of them do not have a great understanding of the English language.

I was disappointed that the hotel did not live up to our expectations, but happy to have had the Kandy House experience.","Beautifully Charming - But Too Many Flaws","2012-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r135530189-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We spent about 2 nights per hotel all over the island including the Kandy House.

Now don't get me wrong, this hotel provides a lovely setting and decent service but in comparison to other boutique hotels in Sri Lanka we just felt that this fell short on a number of aspects, and this was even more disappointing after previous reviews and therefore the anticipation of our stay here.

This is the only hotel I am reviewing from my honeymoon, as I feel it necessary to give a couple of warnings to honeymooners about this hotel.

The first real disappointment was the room which was small and noisy. We had a long day to get to the hotel and when we arrived late afternoon we simply wanted to relax in the room for an hour or two. Unfortunately, and it is probably an exception to the general rule of the rooms, but it was tiny - the bathroom was almost bigger - and it was above the kitchen so not only did this make the room very hot but it was also very noisy with the clanging of pans etc and constant voices. 

I think other rooms though would have been very tranquil and probably larger but for the price we had paid for the room we hadn't expected what I imagine must have been the worst one!

The second disappointment was dinner. You are forced to choose from a set menu with just two choices per course, and just the one option for pudding. To be honest the food was nice, but not amazing, but the real let down was the fact that it was the most expensively priced meal we had all trip. It was almost double the norm of better dinners that we had had in other hotels that provided far greater choice on their menus. 

And finally, which is a bit picky and difficult to prevent, but due to its location (surroundings were woods and paddy fields) there were a lot of mosquito's which made relaxing by the pool after about 3pm impossible... back to the noisy and hot room.

The hotel was half an hour from Kandy but we felt it necessary to get our driver to take us to town for dinner on the second night. Also, it was the only hotel we stayed in that refused to even allow our driver to enter the building. This was not in keeping with the general welcoming and relaxed atmospheres that every other hotel offered during our trip.

Overall, the hotel is a beautiful building and staff try very hard to put you at ease with good service but please just be aware of the above. Our room was Lime Butterfly so I would specifically request not to have this one, especially if on honeymoon. And I would recommend that you make arrangements with your driver to spend at least one dinner somewhere in town if you can which will probably upset the management. This was the only hotel we stayed in where we felt that the hotel was a business rather than a luxury boutique service.

Our main reason for visiting Kandy was to visit friends, we booked three nights, but only stayed fro two.
Kandy House is architecturally stunning as is the setting (apart from the journey to and from Kandy), our room was beautiful with a big separate bathroom but lacked in the amenities that are usually standard in boutique hotels, beware the bathroom floors are dangerously slippery when wet.  The windows were glassless with a light blind and a wooden shutter, following the turndown service the lamps were left on with the blind up and the shutters open hence I got badly bitten by mosquitoes.  On the second night, we changed rooms to one with glass in the window but my husband was not too keen on the bathtub in the bedroom and the toilet just behind a concrete screen.
We were the only guests staying at the time, which was fine but we would have liked a bit more interaction with the local staff, the manager and his wife were very chatty, informative and helpful in finding us an alternate hotel for our third night. At times we did have to go looking for the staff, when we wanted a pre dinner drink, these are generally served without nibbles.
The food was adequate but there was  no choice for example at breakfast we were  asked “how would you like your eggs” not given any other choices, dinner was a set menu but we ate at Kandy house as it was a bit too far to go back into Kandy for dinner.
I had been looking forward to the yoga and Ayurvedic treatments; however there was no yoga teacher available during our visit. I did try an Ayurvedic massage but I cut short the treatment due to getting bitten by mosquito’s again only bars on the window. A massage bed and some relaxing music would have been preferable to a mattress on the floor and the joviality of the kitchen staff, as the kitchen was next to the massage room. We have nothing against hearing happy staff but it doesn’t create the right ambiance for a relaxing massage.  When we provided feedback about the massage it was not charged for but the choice remark ""you are the only person in eight months to not enjoy it"" was unnecessary.
Would we return, to Kandy, yes but to Kandy House, no, in our opinion, it is a good standard guest house but not quite there yet for it to be classed as a boutique hotel.

I researched the Mahoora website extensively before booking on wotif.

We contacted the camp manager ahead of the day to ask check in times as well as to see whether we could join an afternoon safari following checkin. They only came back to us with a check in time so when we arrived (at the designated time) we were told we’d missed the safari. We were actively discouraged from doing a whole day safari, despite this being an offering on the website. There was no responsibility taken by Mahoora for the disconnect between their website and wotif.

We have provided the exact mobile tent published on the website and other communications, without any compromise.

To their credit Mahoura acknowledged our concerns and reassured us that our concerns would be addressed. On a very positive note the staff are as much the value add to the experience as are the surroundings. Of particular note was our naturalist (Puwarhara) who had a deep knowledge and passion for conservation and what Sri Lanka more broadly has to offer. Our safari driver (Nishantha) was the second pair of eyes who spotted wildlife that was ridiculously hard to locate but also took care as we travelled over the roads of the Udawalawe reserve. 
This was however where things stopped. On the ‘negative’ and specifically related to the accommodation the food was quite variable and sadly well below expectations. The barbecued meat on the first night was inedible. We found the Sri Lankan selection on the second night a better option though the food was only warm at best. The so called continental menu was mediocre and not worth the effort. 
Mahoora is an expensive experience and our expectations were that the standard would have been high across our stay. For what you pay there needs to be a serious review with what is being offered particularly if they consider cheaper options now entering the space. The tents appear modified ex-army and are a novel experience but really don’t meet the same glamping standards offered elsewhere around the world. The bathroom facilities are very small and located directly behind a thin partition and the head of your bed. Lighting is poor throughout. In our tent the waste water from the shower seemed to have leaked onto the rug near the bed. This should have been identified as part of their general maintenance along with removing the mould from the bottom of the shower curtain. Perhaps for a one night stay this is tolerable but is really below par. The concept appears good but if you charge a premium you also need to deliver a premium. We have a stay booked for their property at Wilapatu and hope things are better.","Certainly NOT glamping","2019-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r666542092-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

There are 2 main issues. The first is the distance of the camp from the safari park - at least a 30 minute drive in a jeep on bumpy roads followed by queuing to get into the park and then more queuing with numerous other jeeps to buy tickets. 
Mahoori did not provide an English speaking naturalist and the ranger supplied by the safari park spoke very basic English.  We had assumed that the campsite was inside the park - to us, there didn’t seem much point in camping when there were more comfortable accommodations to be found closer to the park.
The second issue was that the Mahoori campground was understaffed. The English speaking manager was doing his best to multitask but appeared overwhelmed by the number of guests that were checking in and requiring orientation/assistance.

The mosquitos are a problem but only one of many.  The tents are cramped and the bathroom smaller - this is not luxury tents in the style that is found in Africa or India.

The words in your heading ""...not the experience we were expecting"" says a lot.Obviously your tour operator had booked the wrong hotel for you.This very long review is largely a cut + paste of your email to your tour operator,written in the context of you trying to get a refund for a hotel arranged for you and which you checked out of before sleeping there one night.That choice is of course yours,and it is fine if the hotel did not suit you,but I am rather surprised you have replicated the same in a public forum - a number of your comments contradict so much written by others,and the overall feedback we have received from guests staying at Coco Tangalla for many years.

We know that your tour operator tried to book a different hotel but Coco Tangalle was booked due to unavailability at your first choice.We also understand the same may have happened in Kandy,where unavailability existed for your first choice and your tour operator also selected an unsuitable alternative.Perhaps overall they did not fully understand the expectations of their client,nor explained that you had been booked in a different type of hotel than your first choice.

In general this review exudes the frustration of a client who was booked by their tour operator into a hotel as a substitute to their first choices - which you have pointed out in your comments - and who ironically would have achieved their first choice near Tangalle had they just not rushed away in haste,without even a proper conversation with the manager,as there had been a last-minute cancellation at the first choice and for the best room no less!

In your enthusiasm to leave and haste to criticise,I feel your comments are somewhat disingenuous and for me importantly,do a disservice to our other guests whose budget may have been less than yours but have thoroughly enjoyed their stay.I don't think it is a coincidence that your review is surrounded by headlines such as ""Outstanding""...""Refined Tranquility""...""Absolute Paradise""...""Fabulous Boutique Hotel""...and more.We hope Coco Tangalle remains the first choice for many more travellers to come,we look forward to welcoming them.

'Each of the six spacious rooms is individually designed and elegantly decorated by combining period-style furniture with brightly coloured silks and Sri Lankan fabrics.
Facilities include a swimming pool and meals are usually served either at the terrace which offers superb views of the sea, or in the garden.'

This is how the hotel was described to us by our tour operator. I just cannot understand why so many postings are so positive. I can see it would suit the needs of some travellers looking for a small bed and breakfast style experience, but as part of an alleged luxury tour of Sri Lanka this hotel did not suit our needs at all. 

This was supposed to be three nights, four days of relaxation and being pampered in a comfortable villa by the sea after quite an exhausting tour.

Reality at coco tangalla - 
only two rooms have sea views. Far from spacious rooms, we were allocated on arrival a narrow bedroom closer to the main road, a busy and dangerous bend with traffic horns, adjacent to the small uninspiring dining facility at this hotel. 

The only window was blocked by a screen separating guest walkway and dining area. I can see why this was done; you would not want to be resting on the bed with the world watching but the consequence was to make the room dark and claustrophobic.

The staff are friendly and welcoming; it is not their fault how Coco Tangalla is represented by the tour operators or the hotel's marketing team. Consumers do deserve the chance to enjoy honest representation of the hotel experience at coco tangalla, especially on the holiday of a lifetime experience that couples booking a luxury tour would expect. This would be fine if we had chosen a three star hotel for our trip.

The management on arrival kindly offered to upgrade us to a bigger room next day, which was appreciated as a gesture, but it is a real lottery booking here to know what room you will end up with especially if your tour guide and driver keeps you out all day on the day of arrival! If you are staying here more than a night or two perhaps check in advance the features and location of the room  allocated to you. It is a small property so not very difficult for the staff to manage your expectations in advance. Also be sure to check the proposed menu for the night of your check in, so you can decide in advance whether to eat on site or not if you are on B and B basis. I would not recommend tying yourself into half or full board at this establishment for any long stay.

Overall description of the property in our opinion is misleading. Meals served on the terrace/garden - it's only a patch of grass next to a modest pool.

The bathroom door does not close very easily, and the towels are thin and hard suggesting old and poorly laundered.

The beach 

Disappointed by the beach which is indeed in front of the property, however the sound of crashing waves on the rocks was very pleasant and the sea is close. Going for a walk on the beach brought us to a suspect pipe and smelly stagnant body of water, broken glass and the beach adjacent to coco tangalla did not feel clean,  in spite of the heavy surf. Might explain some of our thoughts further down about turndown service and subsequent issues with Mosquito control.

Dinner 

Set menu choices limited and unappealing. Surprised not advised in advance that the hotel  has no alcohol licence, which seems somewhat odd for relaxing beach experience hotel. 

We were offered some kind of free wine with dinner the hotel along with some kind of requirement for a voluntary donation, which sounded to me like selling wine without being able to select what you require.

After our rather average meal, we enquired if water for drinking and teeth cleaning would be put into our room during the turn down service. This turned out to be one very small bottle of water to be shared by both of us, not even a bottle each! 

Upon entering the room after dinner, staff had made considerable effort to make the bed look attractive in the small room provided but the fact that the Mosquito nets were fully down was a concern, and the overwhelming smell of insect repellant was truly suffocating: we could not even contemplate sleeping in that room. I had not experienced this suffocating control system in other hotels we visited on this trip.

This hotel may appeal to customers travelling on a budget depending on the rate secured (it's hard to know the rate we paid since this stay was part of a luxury tour arranged in the uk but this was a late substitute by the local ground handling agents) - be wary of any substitute offered on a tour and check both good and bad comments before making your mind up if the substitution seems fair. I will of course be taking this up with the tour operator upon my return, but we were determined to enjoy the rest of our holiday in comfort.

Coco tangalla was not the place to relax and enjoy  the beach we were looking forward to at the end of our otherwise very enjoyable but tiring tour of Sri Lanka. 

We checked out without sleeping in the bedroom, we found there are better alternatives nearby to be pampered with fine dining service and romantic getaway if your budget will stretch. 

Coco Tangalla would certainly not be the right place for a honeymoon, or special anniversary, or birthday. We were extremely disappointed that our first view and taste of the Sri Lankan beach experience was at this property and are very thankful that we were able to move on at further cost to another property.

I know there are some very positive postings on this website and it's is good to have different opinions, I felt we should share our personal experience to help manage expectations of guests looking for feedback about coco tangalla!

If I said the width at the end of the bed to the cupboard was two flip flops wide , the same on one side and on the other we had to put our luggage as there was nowhere else for it to go. After one sleepless night we were offered a slightly bigger room with a separate shower which was a minor improvement but after discovering a cockroach by the toilet that night I wasnt impressed. I expected a better standard and would be hard pressed to give this the equivalent of two stars. The staff were patient and kind and the food was fine. The pool was very nice and as there are only 5 bedrooms it was never crowded. The only room worth having was the King Coco. during our 5 nights here we watched a procession of arrivals look as dismayed and disappointed as we were and ended up feeling sorry for the 5 boys who were running the place.

The only three things that prevent me from awarding this establishment a 'Poor' rating instead of a 'Terrible' rating are the mini garden with the swing, the young lady who served us tea and the abundance of a multitude of fish swimming freely in the lake.

The rest 'falls' away quite fantastically.

The nature/walking path is in such a state of disarray and neglect; I love a nice stroll and a sit but I do not love rusty, broken benches in dilapidated summer huts.

Moving a bit further, we found a poor little pony locked in a mosquito-infested stall...

The swimming pool was maintained poorly with chipped tiles biting into me on more  than one occasion. The changing rooms were merely glorified toilets.

Then there was the buffet...and the lunch service...

The food was bland, mediocre, disappointing.

And, oh-my-lord the lunch service!

The buffet was set to end at 03:30 pm, however the staff began taking away everything at 03:10 pm, rushing and ruining what would have otherwise been a relaxing lunch.

Step back to before 03:10 pm, and the staff began conversing, discussing and laughing rather too loudly disturbing our (expected) quiet lunch. 
Proper training breeds proper performance.

Historical reputation is a thin robe to veil the naked state of slow decay; sad reminders of better days lay strewn about the grounds.

Nothing to thank you.

On arrival we were informed that hot water is only available from 6.30-9.30 am and pm. While on your end there might be difficulty, what you must understand is in this day and age no one goes to a hotel paying close to 40 K a night for basic resources to be withheld as almost every house now has geysers . 
Then we were informed of a power cut. A hotel that has a power cut???? Even my house has an inverter and we didn’t pay so much and come all the way to stay in the dark in an unknown place risking our safety and sacrificing our comfort.

Next the food, while the staff did try their best to accommodate us - more that 3/4 of the menu wasn’t available quite contrary to what is posted on social media. There are advertisements of a games room which looked very enticing . But we found a pretty old and dilapidated room where most games were not even available.

Arrived at the hotel almost an hour after the scheduled check in time. But got to know that my room  was not ready yet so we took a walk through the stunning garden. This resort is located in a stunning landscape. But some basic errors of the management and some rude and neglecting members of the staff ruined our stay completely. 
1.	Hot water was not working properly in my room. And the direction of the faucet was messed up. (On left for the wash basin tap and on the right tap for the shower with no red or blue marks on it.)  
2.	Asked for an iron and a board twice, but never got it so I had to go for the dinner in my gym clothes.
3.	At the restaurant we were totally neglected and no one even offered the drinks menu to our table. (But they were very attentive to some selected tables) 
4.	Food was bland. Fish tasted like fried with old oil. Same desserts for both dinner and lunch.
5.	At the dinner service I spotted someone has put the spoon from a meat dish to a vegetarian dish. When I returned there some 20 minutes later it was still there. 
6.	One of my friends booked a suite with a kitchenette, when asked while booking they said it is fully functional. But the kitchenette was only a non-functioning stove and a couple of glasses plus a bigger refrigerator.  
7.	When asked about how it functions they said that it is there for Arabic customers who bring their own food and ‘cookware’ with them. (Are you serious now?)
8.	 They sent a fruit platter to the suite but had to call the housekeeping again to tell that we can’t eat fruits without a knife to cut them.

9.	After calling few times again finally an iron was delivered to our room. It looked like an antique. (Photos attached). I was almost electrocuted attempting to put some water to the steamer. 

10.	After all the terrible things I decided to take my wife for a spa treatment, when asked about the spa they had a nice answer. ‘’Sir, the spa is opened but we don’t have a therapist today.’’ 
11.	Almost all the people at the restaurant were not even bothering to smile when they spoke to us.

Finally it came to a breaking point when we asked for a little late check-out. Even without asking the reason or anything they rejected it saying ‘’we are full today’’. So I had to remind the person at the reception that we had to wait for some time to get our rooms even we arrived an hour late. His response was ‘’ the room was ready but you went for a walk.’’ Believe me he was the same person who told us that one room was not ready when we arrived. Having enough bad experience I decided to call the manager. 
The assistant manageress listened to our experiences and promptly apologized for the inconvenience. But it didn’t change anything as they have already ruined our hardly found day off. This happened just before the lunch, after which we checked out. Suddenly at lunch service everyone at the restaurant (same people who neglected us for 2 meals) came to us to talk. 
As we booked this stay for a credit card offer, the only thing I can assume is that the staff treats the locals who come to stay with them using such offers as third class customers.  So please do not offer such discounts if you don’t want locals to stay at your property. Because most of the people find it very hard to find a time for a getaway from work and hate it when that day is ruined. And it’s really sad that such a stunning place is abused by the bad attitudes of handful of people.

We were there over the Christmas / new years break. From what the staff told us, the hotel had been struggling with occupancy rates and this was the first time in a while they had a fully booked hotel. Lets just say it showed. Initially, the reception looked and felt quite nice with a bit of an old ski lodge feel to it, but that's where the niceness ended for us. I don't think the room had been cleaned in a while, we actually had to get a hoover in to sort out the room ourselves. The shower leaked so every time it was used, the room was flooded, bringing up all kinds of dirt hidden in the  bathroom and I dare not imagine what else. Amenities were poor e.g. no fridge in the room. When we complained to the manager, he really had no response except to say he will swap our room the next day. It was a real shame as the location is beautiful. Unfortunately our longgggggg drive up to reach the hotel was just not worth it.","Heinous Falls","2017-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r568885722-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

Then we call the hotel and we requested through Ms. Kaushalya Sanadamail weather we can move this reservations to any other hotel in the same group since buffet was not available, but she said could not do it. She transfer the call to Front Office Manager Mr. Suranga  said  that  he cannot move reservation but  he  can speak to chef and arranging buffet or something special. But when we reach their nothing was arranged normal set menu was kept it ready. When we asked from the Front office Manager he explaining about hotel standard, but where he was promised to some special.  We were note expected this kind of answer from the front office Manager. It was so insulated to me in front of my friends, where we hosted stay at your hotel for my friends.   Even there is no apology from the hotel. The mistake what they made.  
I need to mention here that set menu what they provided us there is no value for the money, it is basis menu. We totally unhappy with stay & Service what they provide. Please note I will be attaching the menu as well.
After all this incident I call the hotline and l made a complaint almost 03months still no response from the hotel.

However, the restaurant also did not offer the set menu, which was disappointing. As a result, we had to pay separately and ended up having lunch at the rooftop bar.

One of the most unpleasant experiences was when the housekeeper knocked and immediately entered the room without waiting for a response — a clear violation of privacy.

The lady reception staff member was not as welcoming or friendly compared to other hotels I’ve stayed at, which impacted the overall impression.

On a positive note, the room had a beautiful sea view, although it also included part of the city. The rooftop offered a lovely view as well and was a nice place to relax.

Firstly, I have to stand at the reception lobby during the check in process, not offering to have a seat at the lobby.

My luggages were not delivered to the room and were left somewhere at the hotel for more than 30 minutes and had to go reception lobby to ask for the luggages. No alpologies were extended.

Rooms are small and poor interior design. Very bad view and you will feel very uncomfortable when you enter to the room. I have been offered an upgrade to a sea view room however it was mostly similar, old furniture smell , difficult to breath and very uncomfortable. No ventilation at all.

Very poor communication with department and had to wait for ages for an answer.

I have booked the hotel for 4 nights and due to the terrible service I experienced, I wanted to leave the hotel the same night I arrived and requested for a refund. However, hotel did not agree for any refund and took the charges from me  for 4 nights. I left the hotel the same day. It was very disappointing.

What made it bad was that I was coming from Bentota and had high expectations (both from the hotel and the place) and I was let down in a big way - the beach is really bad and not worth it. Came to know later that Colombo does not have any beaches worth visiting. Food in the hotel was also not good, something which is not expected from a luxury chain like Radisson. Saw a cockroach also in the bathroom which was shocking to say the least. This was my first stay at a Radisson property and I was disappointed to stay the least - they need to learn big time from other luxury chains like Taj/Holiday Inn. The only saving grace was that we got to meet Nasser Hussain there (wonder how come he chose this hotel for his stay).

The hotel is badly in need of a refurbishment. The checkin experience was dismal, as the hotel didn’t respond to two emails I sent to them requesting for a room upgrade we were eligible for as per Radisson’s rewards program. On arrival, the hotel had no information about our emails and couldn’t give us the upgrade. We had booked ocean facing premium rooms. The rooms were very tiny, but yes, it was ocean facing. Breakfast buffet was adequate however, slow and bad service spoiled the experience. None of the orders at the live counters will get served to you, and you have to wait and grab whatever is available. Room service was also really slow.

Only saving grace was the rooftop restobar with infinity pool. View from the top was fantastic and the pool, though small, was well maintained. There were no steam/ sauna arrangements as well. 

This property needs a big uplift to be sold as a Radisson’s property in my opinion.","Disappointing Experience","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5279732-r940526493-Radisson_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

It is disheartening to learn that we did not meet your expectations, especially considering our aim to provide a high standard of service.

while some aspects of my stay were enjoyable, others were quite disappointing.

The biggest issue was the customer service. There were significant delays in check-in and room arrangements, which made the arrival experience frustrating. The staff seemed unorganized and not very attentive to guest needs, which was disappointing.

On the positive side, the food and beverages were excellent. The dining options were well-prepared, and the quality of the meals exceeded my expectations. It was one of the highlights of the stay.

Overall, while the hotel offers great dining, the lack of efficient service and poor room management took away from the experience. I hope they improve their service standards because the potential is there.

I faced disappointment during the reservation process, as my emails went unanswered. I nearly gave up on this resort but decided to give it a chance. Unfortunately, the resort's communication is very poor, and the staff lack hospitality training.

On Saturday, there was no buffet, only à la carte options, which we were not informed about until we arrived at the restaurant. When guests asked questions, the staff often paused for 7 to 10 seconds to use their mobile phones before responding. The coffee machine was broken, forcing us to travel to a nearby resort for a cappuccino.

Compared to other resorts, we were impressed with the service at Maalu Maalu Resort, which is very close to Calm Resort. However, when we called the reception, they asked us to call the relevant extension to place orders, which was inconvenient.

Overall, it was one of the poorest services I have ever experienced. However, I must mention that the restaurant chef and manager were very helpful and attentive to our dietary needs during the buffet, especially regarding allergies.","Poor hospitality","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r951584330-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

First the good points.  The hotel has a great location on Passikudah beach with wide beach frontage and a big pool. The beach is stunning and has a great water sports centre 5 minutes walk down the beach with jet skis, snorkelling etc.  The hotel spa was also nice.  
Now the bad points. Staff not able to communicate well and terrible service for everything.  The only thing that was quick was taking your plate away the minute you stopped eating.  Food in the restaurant was buffet only with a poor choice and poor quality.  Also restaurant enclosed with no air conditioning making for uncomfortable eating.  Very difficult to get an alcoholic drink too. Gym had limited equipment and also not air conditioned.  Lots of Russian visitors with signs and TV all in Russian too.  Only 10 sun loungers at the pool and difficult to get pool towels or any drink/food by the pool.  Beach bar never open.  Rooms ok but layout of hotel means all first floor rooms have no view as they look onto the beach bungalows and second floor rooms also limited views too due to beach bungalows so not able to sit on balcony to enjoy the outlook.  Our rooms were also close to staff quarters plus pigeons nesting in the roof so quite noisy.  Also watch out for the visiting cockroaches in the bathrooms and poor drainage meaning shower regularly flooded the adjacent bathroom area.
Sorry to say we were disappointed with this hotel considering it is advertised as 4*.  We would rate it more like a low 3*.  Passikudah definitely worth a visit but if we recommend to stay in one of the other 4* hotels on the bay if you can.","Disappointing!

We ordered  a snack ;redcrum fired prawns.it was burn to chacol and took over 50minits.
After  complaining we got another dish.
It s very unpleasant  to go to hotel to relax yet complaining  each and every thing.
The staff was clueless ,they dont have any idea about hospitality .
Morning breakfast was served  in a cramped room,more like a store,we went to enjoy  ,but how can you expect to have breakfast  in a storeroom?
The second  night was a total  disaster,the we got continues tripped and over 15times  
no continues  electricity  and AC is not working.
After we complain this issue  we got another room around 10.30p.m.
For two night stay we got three room changes.!
The bar does not have a cocktail  menu, and barman was very rude unhelpful  person.

Your disappointment is completely understandable, and we take full responsibility for the service issues you encountered. The lack of proper welcome, delayed responses to requests, and cleanliness concerns you've highlighted are not acceptable and do not reflect our brand standards.

- The pantry/kitchenette areas in the stand alone villa and pool house had cockroaches. The kettle, caffetiere and coffee cups were not cleaned. The fridge smelled of old food.  
- there was a small snake near the kurumba house pool 
- toiletteries in the bathrooms were empty

While the property itself is beautiful, the rooms and particularly the service needs careful attention.

We are saddened to read this review and taken aback by the harshness of it, considering no indication or mention of your dissatisfaction whatsoever was made by you or your partner at any point during your stay. We wish you had given us the chance to address the issue of noise disturbance from next door while you were staying with us, as we would have at least been able to move you to a different room/side of the property (or even another of our beach properties), away from the construction sounds, or asked the builders to restrict their activities to certain times of the day. Instead of this you chose to wait till you had returned home to email us your complaints and subsequently post this scathing review because you didn’t accept our offer of compensation, wanting a refund of your stay instead, and having first threatened in your email to us that you would be “warning” others by reviewing us online. 

Other guests who were staying around the same time period as you had no such complaints or concerns about building noise or the state of the bay/beach, for instance. Unfortunately flat seas and white sands are not to be found anywhere along the South and West coast during the Monsoon, not even at Rekawa, which you mentioned is lovely, and is just 15km away from our Mawella Bay. We wish to clarify that during this monsoon/ low season month of September, when our accommodation rates are lowest (and we believe to be excellent value for money, contrary to your view) the ocean tides deposit rubbish/flotsam & jetsam right along the Southern/Western coast, yet it bears mentioning that the photograph you have posted is not of our beach-front, but of another section of the bay/beach. We have a dedicated team of gardeners and staff that attend to our direct beach front year round to ensure that this area is kept clean for our guests. Regarding your other remark about our beach front, we would like you to know that the reason we have a chain-link fence is to keep out stray dogs and cattle that walk along the bay or come from the nearby village, which used to be a real problem for us. The reason we chose this material (which was not ‘cheap’ by any means) instead of building a wall or planting vegetation was to allow views of the ocean from the main villa. 

Regarding the construction noises from next door, you say you “raised this with the management” (yes, but a week after you had left us) who “told us clearly that they didn’t feel the need to warn their guests about the building noise”- this is misleading and untrue, as is your presumption that next door is a building site that will make Mawella “completely unenjoyable for some time to come”. 

Regarding your comment about our selection of wines, we would like to clarify that during this low season period, we stock three types of red and three white New World table wines, all of which are suitable for storage and consumption in the tropical humidity, along with beer and other beverages which are more suitable for this climate. We take your criticism on board however and intend to have at least two premium wines available during the High Season for our guests, so we thank you for that pointer. 

While we feel some of your statements are deliberately damaging and ignorant of facts (such as how long noise from the building work next door will continue for, or the price of lobster in the monsoon season) we understand that aesthetic tastes of style, design, layouts etc are highly subjective, and thus will not address your assessment of the same at Mawella- fortunately the majority of our guests & reviewers do not share your opinion. 

We wish to apologize for the genuine shortcomings in our service (eg that staff members offered different opinions of whether you could swim in the sea or not- for the record, the answer is always “if you practice caution & know your own limits”) and we are sorry to hear that our staff were not as proactive or helpful as you expected. Never before have we found a lack of fluency in English to be a sore point for any of Taru Villas guests- perhaps because we have visitors from many different backgrounds and nations (French German Portuguese Chinese etc)- but also because at all times we have an English speaking Manager and one or two service staff with adequate levels of English on duty. 

Yours Sincerely,
Team Taru Villas

The furnishings and décor are very tasteful indeed.  And they've got a good chef, the Sri Lankan food in particular is good (if expensive).  The main garden has some good old trees

The main thing to warn you about is the building noise.  There is a building site right next door (within a metre of their boundary), and our stay featured dull, heavy thuds every few seconds from before 0800 lasting all day, interspersed with the whine of saws and angle grinders.  Then some sort of festival or event with a booming sound system until 0500 (although this party, unlike the building noise, might have been a one-off).  We raised this with management who told us clearly that they do not feel they need to warn guests about this, even though they are marketing themselves as a luxury haven of relaxation.  The building works apparently stop and start, but were nowhere near finished when we were there in September 2017, I would expect noise and disruption for some time yet.  This is clearly unfortunate for Taru Villas, but they have chosen to make it their guests problem rather than theirs, no warnings, no chance to rebook, no discounted rates.  This was exacerbated by very poor soundproofing in our room (staff talking fairly quietly in the kitchen, for example carried clearly into our toilet - and presumably vice versa...).

The noise is a good enough reason to stay away, but it's by no means the only problem here.  

Whilst the interiors are luxurious, outside is really badly thought-out.  They have completely ruined the narrow sea view by fencing it off with a cheap chain-link fence and leaving a barren, square patch of compacted sand/soil with weeds in it (see photo).  I guess they might call it a 'private beach' but it looks like a forgotten car park.  It is one of the worst uses of an ocean frontage I've ever seen.  I've never been within 30 metres of the sea and felt so far from it.  Mawella Beach - although no fault of Taru's - was also properly filthy when we were there.  We tried to go for a walk but turned back after a few minutes, sick of wading through oil-stains too big to avoid (see photo).  This might be better in other seasons, but Mawella was horrid in September (Rekawa bit further up the coast, however, was still lovely).

Worth also mentioning Taru's obsession with 'privacy' (a selling point according to their promotional material).  What 'privacy' seems to mean is fussy little screens everywhere so nobody can see each other at dinner.  Never mind that in the communal pool you pretty much look into someone's living room.  Or that, as an open-plan complex of bungalows, it is never going to be anywhere near as private as somewhere that offers upper-storey rooms.  So they end up providing very little real privacy (esp. with noise) whilst making you unsure where is part of the communal grounds and where isn't.  Weird and confused.

Other problems:
- No reliable wifi connection, and staff gave conflicting instructions about which network to use and how to connect.
- Staff gave three different answers about whether you could swim in sea (yes, no, maybe).
- Excessively expensive seafood and alcohol (we expect a mark-up in a high-end place, sure, but lobster is cheaper in London!).  And if you're going to put that sort of mark-up on a wine list, please don't just have Jacobs Creek!
- Very tiny pool that had been badly over-chlorinated when we were there, pretty much had to glue my skin back on after a 20 min swim.
- Difficult to communicate with many staff, although they showed willing.  I'd never dream of raising this as a criticism on the street or in a low-medium range hotel.  But for somewhere that markets itself to the international luxury market, and there being no shortage of good English speakers in Sri Lanka...

So, overall, this was the worst part of a two-week holiday in Sri Lanka.  The noise would have spoiled it, but even without that I think Taru is some way off justifying its price point.  This place is spectacularly bad value.

But one star for somewhere that is generally trying (the poor staff have to don raincoats to sweep up leaves knocked down by rain)?  Too harsh? The problem for Taru is that there are plenty of mid-range places in Sri Lanka that are getting pretty much everything right.  Taru's offer is muddled and complacent, and the building noise and filthy beach will probably make it completely unenjoyable for some time to come.","Beware building noise late 2017!

"5","359718168","en","9591209",,"Owner","361381399","en","2016-04-03","TaruManagement","Dear Mr. Chandra, 
While thanking you for your recognition of what we have tried to do right, this long review of yours is a misrepresentation of the truth. It must be answered for the sake of balance and veracity. Several aspects you have failed to mention, which shed new light on your story & allegations, as follows: You have acknowledged that you stayed with us first in early January (for 5 days) and you were evidently so pleased with the Taru Villas ""product"" and what we offer our guests, that you booked to return for a much longer period the very next month - to the latest property to be added to our portfolio, Mawella- recently upgraded from its earlier incarnation as a private residence. Because you wished to stay with us for a period of approx. 3 weeks, you negotiated a very discounted rate which we were happy to offer you because of the unusual length of your proposed stay. The one proviso being that you paid for it in advance. It is most certainly the practice not just at Taru Villas but in almost all small properties to take full payment on confirmation (no small hotel or villa worth its salt, will be naive enough to let a guest stay in credit for extended periods). This is considered good & usual hotelier practice in a sometimes dishonest world. Despite the very special rate you were staying for (including breakfast, services charge and all government taxes of approximately 24.3%, we refunded you the unused nights in full, sent you a gift and extended you courtesies & complementaries, both during and for the inconvenience at the end of your stay. We did not insist on applying our cancellation policies to your request for a refund. I believe it is wrong and inconsiderate to demand much more than that. It is also highly presumptuous to suggest that you would not have received your refund if you had not followed it up with your persistent calls, when you are clearly ignorant of the red tape and bureaucracy that must be addressed in order to have a local bank conduct a debit card refund to an international bank, despite conceding there were also bank holidays in the midst of this exercise! In our experience, 10 days is hardly unusual, even if not to be condoned. Further, out of a period of 21 days, your dissatisfaction and sudden decision to check out occurred on the 15th day of your second sojourn at Taru Villas. This alone speaks loudly to the lack of balance in your review (2 stars? a ""poor"" rating on TripAdvisor? Of course you are entitled to your review and rating, but I am also entitled to declare it undeserved.) You implored us to allow you to stay (in the Master Suite no less), despite us warning you of the inconvenience you may face in having to change rooms within the villa to accommodate prior bookings; you were even willing to check out of Mawella completely for a few days to accommodate a prior ""whole villa"" booking request by a private party (again which you had been apprised of while you negotiated your rates, before the booking confirmation).  You also opted to stay when we explained to you that we were facing some serious teething problems with the electrical systems in these first two months of operation, and that there would be inevitable power interruptions while we tried to fix the problem. And that, Mr. Chandra, I believe now makes for a more rounded representation of the facts.... I didn't even mention your penchant for visiting local shops/restaurants in the vicinity and bringing in meals to our villa, which is generally unacceptable in any small hotel establishment (our business at Taru Villas – Mawella is based on providing both board and lodging to our guests, not a private holiday home where you can bring in your own food- for that style of vacation we now have, for instance, Taru Villas – Kurumba right next door to Mawella, a small holiday home that you can rent and arrange your own meals and not have the services of a small hotel), this in spite of praising our in-house chef/kitchen and his quality of food. 
One can't ""have one's cake and eat it too"" Mr. Chandra.

The main 4 bedroom villa is in a stunning location right on the beach. Just like the Rampart  street villa you could sense Taru's influence on the immaculate furnishings, very clean and tidy. We were not disappointed our large room was overlooking the ocean, ""brilliant"". We were here in January with a friend and when she left we rebooked for a longer stay in February. The staff here are the best we have encountered n the country including the Manager, the room boys and the chef was outstanding. They went out of their way to please the guests and they were genuinely very pleased to see us returning in February.
The problem with Taru villas is their  policy of insisting that you pay in full in advance for the accomodation including breakfast for the full duration of your booking. Then when you leave you pay for any outstanding extras that you may have had like drinks and any extra meals. They had no policy of refunding any monies to you if you had to curtail your stay in case of any unforeseen circumstances arising due to them.
The problem started when they started to install solar panels while they had guests staying at the time. They brought in an area  maintainance manager to undertake this and also to release the resident manager as he was called away due to a family member taken ill. This new manager was totally unprofessinional,rude and insulting. During this installation we had numerous electrical power cuts caused by the fuses blowing. Which meant that we had power cuts to our room on 2 consecutive nights.this affected 3 of the 4 rooms at the villa. It is no fun in this tropical heat and humid conditions even the locals were finding it very uncomfortable. An electrician attended to the fault but on the 3rd day the fuse to our room blew twice before we got into bed, we immediately gave notice to leave first thing the next morning. This was no holiday but an endurance test. This had nothing to do with power cuts in the Island as Taru villas have their own generator.
The next morning they were unable or did not know how to refund my money I had paid for the days I will not be staying due to the problem that they had caused. I had paid in full by my direct debit card and it is a very simple transaction for them to refund the money back to my account. Since they could not do this I asked for the cash equivalent, no they did not have the cash but they now insisted that I pay in full for the extras I have had which was a much smaller amount than what they owed me. I said that this was redidiculous, but they insisted that if I wanted the refund I would have to pay for the extras in full. We were so drained and tired by then and knew we had to find alternative accomodation nearby. So we paid by debit card on the understanding that they will refund the money owed within 2 to 3 days as it was a bank holiday.
As I suspected the money was not transferred to my bank as promised. I now had to chase them up with numerous phone calls to them and my bank. I spoke to theTaru villathe manager and he put me on to the head office district area manager, she in turn put me on to their firms accountant who then passed the responsibility to his bank. I wondered why am I chasing all these people when it is their responsibility ? I rang up the head office area district manager I had spoken to earlier and insisted I wanted to speak to Taru she said that Taru was abroad on business. A few days later I rang her up again this time she tells me that Taru is somewhere in the office but she cannot see her whereabouts but tells me that she would get Taru to ring me back. Since I did not get this call back I sent Taru a email to the head office but to this day I have not heard from her. I got my refund on the 10th day and I believe that if I had not persivered I may not have got the refund. Imagine if I had left the country it would have cost me an arm and a leg just on phone calls to chase these guys up.
What is astonishing is that they charged me in full for the 3 sleepless nights my wife and I had to endure. No compensation was offered nor given. It is even sadder that I believe that Taru is not aware of these events taking place and it is shocking that the middle management team of a boutique villa can act in this way.  I urge all future potential customers not to pay in full, pay a deposit to secure your booking and settle up at the end of your stay to avoid any similar incidents.

The Villa was not aware that guests had requested for an Ocean Room with Bath at the time of check-in. Guests were checked-in to the room around 4.00pm and around 5.30pm guests had called the reception and informed that they require a room with a bathtub. 

The Executive Housekeeper who was available on duty immediately visited the villa and attempted to speak to the guests and explain. Guests insisted on  speaking to the Duty Manager. The Duty Manager was on a break, but upon notifying he reached the Villa within 15 minutes. The Duty Manager explained to guests that all rooms with baths were sold out and the hotel did not pre-reserve a room with a bath as prior request was not made.

The Ubuntu Beach Villas by Lantern consists of 4 Ocean View Rooms with Bath, 4 Ocean Rooms without bath in addition to its 8 Courtyard rooms. Since all rooms with baths were occupied, we arranged an upgrade to a suite at Lantern Boutique Hotel which is over U$ 100 per night, twice the size and more luxurious.

Guests declined the offer and requested for a refund. It is a common practice internationally for all guests to pay at the time of check-in. If guests wished to change the hotel, cancellation charges would have applied.

1. When we arrived, they sent us to a different building a few minutes away from the main building by tuk tuk which wasn´t explained in the advert. If you want breakfast or dinner you must go there. 

2. As soon as you get there, when you do the check in, you have to pay for your stay before you see your room, and here was my mistake. 

3. We booked the Ocean View Room. The description and the photos showed that the room had a nice bathtub however the room they gave it to us didn´t have it. We complained but the duty manager had a 2 hour break so we had to wait fa full 2 hours until he came back to find a solution. 

4. After 2 hours he confirmed that they didn´t have any rooms with a bath left and there nothing they could do about it so we decided to leave however they said that they couldn´t give us the money back. They showed us another room but it wasn´t what we booked so we argued for another 2 hours, they laughed at us and made us feel really uncomfortable. The duty manager didn´t speak very good English so he had to tell someone else to translate. It was a nightmare...

5. In the end I phoned the website where I booked the hotel and thank God they helped us and find another place to stay and arranged everything to fix this mess. 

6. To be fair, the hotel looks nice and clean, just make sure you check what you booked and see the room before to avoid this situation.

Thank you very much for your valuable comments.
Please accept our sincere apologies for this misunderstanding which has made your stay at the Lantern a bit unpleasant.     

As a practice we have informed all our customers well in advance (at the time of the reservation) of this supplementary charge and if it has missed out with you, we are extremely sorry about it. The management of the hotel has taken up this matter very seriously and necessary steps have taken not to repeat these type of lapses in the future.

Many thanks once again, and look forward to seeing you again at the lantern in the near future.

On the 10th of October I received an email from the hotel notifying us that there was a compulsory buffet dinner and like it or not we had to fork out an additional $260 for this. We were rather perplexed by this late condition. We pointed out that we had already made dinner/party plans for the evening. Furthermore our group included two vegetarians. We were bluntly informed that there was no choice in the matter. At this late stage we were out of options for accommodation elsewhere. The rooms were nice enough for the price we paid.

Several elements of your experience were explained to you at the hotel when you first discussed this with us.  Being a heritage building, we have severe restrictions on what can and cannot be done to the building.  That being said, you were offered an opportunity to move rooms on the day you arrived, which you turned down ""because you didn't want to deal with the stairs"", despite having to use stairs to reach the room you had booked.

The Grand Apartment Suite which is the one across from you, is connected by a sitting room, which, unless used, insulates you from any sound coming from the room itself.  We cannot account for sound coming from the property next door, however.

Lastly, the cancellation policy was made very clear prior to booking, and was the reason that no refund was offered.  Your original reason for leaving was the lack of exhaust fan in the bathroom.  When we explained that the cancellation policy would still apply, then other ""issues"" came to light.

We are sorry that your experience was not what you had hoped for, but this matter has been dealt.

We are sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your stay at The Galle Fort Hotel.  The trouble with a 400 year old Unesco Heritage building is that we have immense restrictions on what we are able to do, structurally, that don't disrupt the integrity of the property.  This does mean, however, that wooden ceilings which are also wooden floors can be disruptive if the room above is occupied, and the other guests have early starts for activities like whale watching or flights to catch.  We are currently working with the Galle Heritage Foundation on the best way to resolve this, without going against their rules.

I also presume by ""large holes in the carpet, torn curtains"", that you are referring to the mosquito nets that hang from the bed itself (as a precaution against any mosquitoes that might be present), and the original panel rugs that cover the top canopy of the bed, as we have no curtains in any of our rooms.  Certainly the floor carpet, recently purchased, doesn't have holes.

With regards to breakfast, you requested, and were given, multiple meals by the team, so perhaps waiting for all those plate to come made it seem chaotic?

Thank you for letting us know how disappointed with your stay you were.  

Whilst your experience definitely left you with a bitter taste in your mouth, and there were some communication issues at the time, one of your rooms WAS ready at 13:30, and the other room was in fact ready at 14:05, and the staff agreed with you that check ins would be done simultaneously after lunch.  At this time, you made the request that the luggage be put in the rooms in the interim, which was done.  Usually, we put the luggage in the room after the guests have been shown to the room, so that we can put the luggage in an area that suits them; leaving the cases downstairs made sense at the time.  Going forward, we will of course put the luggage near the beds instead.

Your lunch was, unfortunately, delayed somewhat due to a group of 26 that was dining at the same time, and the kitchen was trying to ensure that they all got their meals together at the same time.  We apologise for not being able to get your meals out at the same time.

We do apologise unreservedly for the delay at breakfast the following morning, however; there was a communication breakdown between our kitchen and service teams, which resulted in your meal taking longer than it should have.

Compliments of the season, and thank you for sharing your thoughts.  I will take them up with the kitchen team and do a thorough retest of the various flavours, as they absolutely should be authentic, and are definitely not ""watered down"".  Sri Lankan food is not specifically ""spicy"" hot, per se, but it does have a variety of different spice flavours, all affected by the region a dish comes from, and we try to respect those regions by recreating their dishes authentically.  If we are missing that mark, and the food is not spicy hot enough, guests can always request housemade chilli or fresh chillies to add to their meals.

However, it's good to know that for you, we didn't get it right, and we can make the necessary changes to sort this out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28 Church Street, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"28 Church Street","","556080","6.026645","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.21746","Galle Fort Hotel","1100","4.5","27","18","79","215","761","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d556080-Reviews-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.galleforthotel.com/","2025-01-07","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My review is not about the hotel, but its restaurant

Its located in the hotel and overlooks the room blocks and the swimming pool. At dinner, the ambiance was beautiful and relaxing. 

The menu for dinner had a selection of starters. The main courses were divided into a section suggesting that dishes were from specific parts of Sri Lanka and another section with straightforward mains. The starters were good. We ordered 3 different mains to be shared. The portions were only good for one person and not enough to be shared. We should have been better advised by the waiter. 

And the main courses were bland. Despite being advised by the waiter that they would be spicy. Sri Lankan food is great. But the ones produced here are bland and a very poor representation of Sri Lankan flavours. Perhaps they have been watered down to suit the Western palates. If so, let the patrons know so that we can request for Sri Lankan authentic flavours

I would not recommend this restaurant for its food.","Lovely Ambiance at Restaurant but if its Sri Lankan flavours that you’re looking for, then this is not the place","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r988139618-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Compliments of the season.  

I'm so sorry to read of your frustrations with booking accommodation for your family at the Galle Fort Hotel. 

That said, we ABSOLUTELY do welcome families with children.  However, given the age and design of the property, there will be certain rooms that we prefer not to allocate to families with small children, due to safety concerns.  We also have a limited number of rooms, aside from those, which can accommodate extra beds, and still provide you enough space as a family.  If those rooms are not available, you would have been advised that we would not have been able to accommodate you in the rooms that were available on your chosen dates.

If you would still like to stay with us, you can reach us through the email address on our website, and we will be happy to assist you wherever possible.

After rechecking the hotel site and wasting an hour trying to understand we called the hotel again.

At the end we were just clearly told that it is the hotel policy not to accommodate families and kids.

,

Clearly the Galle Fort Hotel did not meet your expectations during your stay and it was marred by some regrettable and most unfortunate incidents. It is not the way we conduct our business as is apparent with our other reviews.I believe your main contention with us was the room that was allocated to you. This was in fact an upgrade from the junior suite you booked on the request of your travel agent. They were aware of the layout of the room and in fact should have briefed you before you checked in.

In addition I also want to address a few of your other complaints;
We are a tropical country and it is to be expected that there would be some form of flies, especially in the heat.
The black spots you mentioned on the wall of the shower area is in fact stone chips that is part of the terrazzo wall.
Again, the dinner that you claim was very expensive, was booked by your Travel Agent. I'd like to add that given it was a 7 course special dinner, during the peak of the festive season, the price paid was quite reasonable, especially if you compare other options around the fort.

It is also regrettable that you used foul language on my staff, which was uncalled for and caused an unnecessary spectacle with all the other guests around.

It is very clear that you have had issues with your agent here, but taking it out on the hotel is not very nice.

However, I do hope the rest of your trip was good and that your family had an enjoyable time in Sri Lanka.

We called back to confirm the reservation, having cancelled another hotel reservation in country only to have be informed that we could no longer have a reservation.  We were told that we must have lied or misrepresented ourselves (we most certainly did not) because the room we’d been offered wasn’t available to a family with a child, even one of an older age.  We were further chastised and lectured that as a “heritage” property the hotel feared that children would damage the premises we were not welcomed.  Funnily enough our daughter has been welcomed at heritage properties around the globe with far more significant art collections, and antiques; she is hardly a hooligan.  Clearly this hotel does not welcome all guests seeking to enjoy Sri Lanka’s culture and history, and is happy to leave potential guests hanging on their whims.  When we asked to speak to a manager to see if anything could be done we were told the manager didn’t return phone calls.  Sadly we will  be bypassing Galle; if you are looking to explore Sri Lanka-we recommend it, but please tread carefully where this property is concerned.

There is also no modern bathroom - a primitive shower and toilet are located in the sitting room, neither is tiled, and there was damp on the plaster in the one in our suite. We felt the whole place needed upgrading to meet the standards of luxury advertised. We stayed in some lovely heritage properties in Sri Lanka, but this was unfortunately not one of them.

I have never had issues and always found the people to be welcoming, friendly and honest!
I have admired the Galle Fort hotel since its opening and had always promised myself a stay when the opportunity arose. On a return trip to India my family and I decided to call into Sri Lanka and visit this hotel among others! A short break that we where very much looking forward to.
On first impressions the hotel itself is gorgeous and certainly lived up to expectations.
Whilst checking into our room I enquired about extending our stay another night. The gentleman ( who gave the impression of Manager.. Prattesh.or similar???) advised that he would come back to our room to advise if an extension was possible. Approx 20 minutes later Prattesh advised that we could extend however we would need to pay him cash for the extension. I then enquired if we could upgrade our room to one of the larger apartments on the top floor. Prattesh again left our room and later returned, advising that we could upgrade however again we would need to pay cash directly to him to do so...in our room!! ( a very unfamiliar process for a hotel ). After checking into the larger apartment we paid the considerable figure in cash directly to Prattesh without receipt from him!! On doing so we requested a late check out to assist with our late flight out from Colombo which he agreed would be 2pm.
On the day of our departure we met Prattesh in the morning at breakfast following his one days leave. He advised me that unfortunately we would need to leave the hotel room by 11am due to other bookings...which was not the arrangement agreed.
We packed promptly and left for another hotel for day use feeling very disgruntled, let down and annoyed at the operations of the Hotel management.
Unfortunately in haste i left my new Apple wireless EarPods in the room. When I returned to Australia I contacted the Hotel and spoke with Prattesh and discussed the return of my Ear/Air pods. He advised that they had found them and would return them via post. I offered to pay for all costs however was advised that they would be returned. Unfortunately 3 weeks later i had not received them so I contacted the Hotel and spoke with the Western GM and had the same discussion. He advised me that this would be addressed and he would notify me of associated costs. Unfortunately now almost 3 months later I have had no contact or no headphones as promised!!! Extremely poor, dishonest, inadequate and disappointing service from a hotel of this standard! I will not recommend this hotel to anyone due to our very poor experience!! Such a shame and a sham for something with so much potential!

Thank you for your criticism of our establishment and I am truly sorry that you have been left with a poor image of us. 

I have looked into your complaint and it turns out that you were not a guest of the hotel and were in fact seated next door at Fort Bazaar but ordering drinks from us as they do not have a liquor license. As I am sure you are aware we are in the busiest time of the year here in the fort. The staff here do not normally serve people outside of the hotel and this must have been a favour to you. I am sure you can understand serving people in a different premises would create some issues.

As for the price being double. I have your bill in front of me and you ordered 2 x glasses of Chardonnay, 1 x Lion Lager & 1 x Gin & Tonic coming to a total of Rs3,915 or US$26 roughly.

I hope that when you leave reviews like this you do think about the people whose livelihood will be affected by your harsh words. 

I hope you have a great year ahead,

And they took just a few of the large bills (but more than 1500$ in total), so you wouldn't notice the money was gone. We noticed the next day, when we were in a different town. And we went to the police, but they said we can only press charges in the same town it happened and we have to go to court and we have to stay in Sri Lanka for at least a week after (and we didn't have so much time), but we could tell the hotel and the police were trying to make us not press the charges.

The reviews that the rooms are tired are all true, our shower filled our bathroom up and the whole thing was quite grimy and dated. 

Corridors contained piles of dirty plates, which I can only assume attracts pests. 

Unless you get a lift somewhere, there are no options to eat nearby. The in-house buffet was the lowest quality of our entire stay - and came in at a massive $25 per person. This of course being the ‘foreign tourist price’. I was that taken aback I took a photo of the bill to check if it was a mistake.

We normally really enjoy staying at Jetwing hotels inc Beach, Lagoon and even at St Andrews on our previous visit. 
As before St Andrews is a wonderful character building. The service in the bar area was first class on this visit. As was the Xmas meal.
Check-in was our first meh experience though. We are touring and some of us are on residency visas and not tourists. Unlike other hotel stays this trip where a copy of the visa is requested and it's done, this time an unprompted point was made by staff about us having the local rate discount which I had booked online and an almost disbelief by staff it was valid for westerners. It made us feel uncomfortable.
We were placed on the ground floor opposite the small courtyard. Within 5 meters of the dining area. Being Xmas I expected it to be festive as in louder around the hotel. During dinner there was live singing. We left the dining area at 2200  where there were only 2 to 3 tables left. At 2230 the music from the area was increased by 100% which was really loud in our rooms. I assumed it was a disco, karaoke and wished I had been placed in a room further away but being Xmas I was obviously sympathetic. At 0100 the noise was louder still and the quality of the singing had decreased. Wanting to sleep a member of our party went out to enquire how much longer it would last. It was then established that after 2230 no hotel guests were involved but instead it was the staff having a private party. I find this deeply inconsiderate and rude to fee paying guests and their families they had no regard to the noise levels. Instead of waking up Xmas day feeling festive and well rested we felt tired and annoyed.

bathrooms need a very big renovation its all stained and old.

its not worth the price at all the food quality is very low very low in comparison to my last stay in 2013.
for the price charged you can get better new clean hotel rather than this.
hope the jetwing chain consider a renovation to this beautiful property and make the best out of it.","needs renovation","2021-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579216-r856969736-Jetwing_St_Andrew_s-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience as the rooms are not great. The style of the hotel is very British which is absolutely fine as that's the theme however it needs to be updated in the sense of new paint and things needing to be fixed. The room we were given was very disappointing, there were a number of marks on the walls and ceilings, the bathroom door was broken, the bathroom was dirty and had a used bar of soap which we thought was disgusting especially during times of covid, the water bottles provided were not sealed which to me meant that it has just been filled up and reused. We had lunch at the hotel and saw on 3 separate occasions 
of guest complaining to the staff. As my wife is gluten free (coeliac) and vegetarian we had to speak to the staff to see what they could do. The chef was able to make a gluten free soup however when it came out the waiter brought it accompanied with bread sticks which are not gluten free. I understand it could have been a mistake but I would expect better care. Working in a restaurant the staff should be more aware. After lunch we sat outside and ordered some drinks. My wife ordered a hot chocolate which was horrible, it tasted like it was burnt. We spoke to a staff member and they said that it didn't look right and offered to make us a new one but we declined. This drink was still included in our bill when we were checking out so had to waste 10minutes to have that removed. The dinner was ok but I would of expected better especially as it was Christmas day. The chef did walk my wife through the dishes to say what she could eat but after dinner she suffered with pain which was most likely to do with eating something which had gluten in it. We were also awaken at 3am with some people shouting outside our room which added to our bad experience.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel, the only reason I am giving it 2 stars rasher than 1 is because the chef did try to help my wife with her dietary requirements.","Dirty rooms, in need of refurbishment","2021-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579216-r824349688-Jetwing_St_Andrew_s-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Das Hotel sieht von aussen durchaus gut aus, wenn man die Kleinigkeiten nicht entdecken will.
Die Fotos sagen schon einiges aus, es wird sich bemüht, die Anlage sauber zu halten.
Ist bei der Menge an Krähen aber fast utopisch. Wie andere auch schon schrieben, kaum saubere intakte Liegen zu finden.
Immer aufpassen wo setzt man sich hin. Sonst ist Kleidung waschen angesagt....

Das Hotel wird wohl von den meisten Reisenden für 1-2 Nächste gebucht, wir waren wohl die Ausnahme mit 6Nächten.
Das bedeutet dann auch keine! Abwechslung beim FrühstücksBüffet!

Wir sind sehr früh gelandet - um 6:30Uhr schon im Hotel angekommen.
Klar da ist noch kein Zimmer fertig.... Es wurde gleich ein EarlyCheckIn angeboten, für schlappe 75USDollar?
Dafür darf man dann sofort auf ein Zimmer - Frühstück gibt es aber dennoch nicht? Das kennen wir auch schon anders.

In meinen Augen ist Management fehl besetzt, die Mitarbeiter sind im Service sehr bemüht, im Rahmen ihrer Möglichkeiten,
aber FrontOffice? pffff
Frage von mir wurde mal gestellt, wo ist die nächste Apotheke? Antwort - 50 Meter die Straße runter...
Ja da hängt ein Apotheken Schild, ein Supermarkt, SimLaden und Apotheke in einem Zimmerchen....
Es wurde aber keine Unterstützung angeboten? Sollen wir etwas besorgen?? Nichts! Und das von 3 Personen mit eher Langeweile hinter dem Counter.
Für 5 Sterne Hotel - da kennen wir anderes...","Eher nicht buchen","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r1008080128-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

After visiting the south west and south of the island, this time we decided to have a bit of convenience of the airport-proximity and stayed at Heritance Negombo for six nights in four rooms for the group. 

The hotel is perfectly located at the Negombo beach with nice surroundings and easy beach access. The lawns are very well kept. All rooms are sea facing and spacious enough. 

That’s where I run out of the positives for this place unfortunately. Comparatively, this was our worst Sri Lankan hospitality experience. Kindly let me begin:
- despite booking months in advance with requests to allocate rooms together (as travelling with 80+ old parents), albeit in the same wing, we were given rooms apart. The duty manager gave us sloppy excuses when challenged. The other request regarding birthday of a group member was completely ignored.
- one room wasn’t ready at checkin despite we arriving at 5pm. The cleaning was down in a haste with room full of mosquitoes when handed over to us. 
- the restaurant was shambles to begin with. On day one, over dinner, we were completely ignored over the other Caucasian guests with order not arriving for well over an hour. While we thought that this was an exception, unfortunately the trend was to be seen everywhere. 
- Most guests use this as one or two night stay at the start or the end of their tour. Having booked it for a long stay, we were astonished to see that breakfast spread was exactly the same every day which was a haphazard array of assortments with poor quality. Offerings at other similarly priced hotels in SL is far superior. 
- The staff lacked attention to detail and hardly acted to customers’ requirements. On regular occasions, meal (or general) requests were lost, miscommunicated or mismanaged. It reflected lack of proper training even at supervisory level. 
- My parents were left locked out of their room at 11pm for more than 30minutes due to low battery reflecting poor housekeeping but it was not that what irked us but the behaviour of a staff member who questioned us if we were valid guests for the room despite three time card renewal by the reception. 
- The restaurant menu lacked variety especially if you have dietary restrictions. My parents who were vegetarians just had couple of items on the whole a-la-carte menu to order from (imagine this is Sri Lanka which has abundance of vegetables and fruits). Even the SriLankan menu was sparse. There were no coconuts (even at outdoor bar despite being on the menu) or bananas (at breakfast) to be found during our long stay with excuses galore (again don’t forget this is land of bananas and coconuts but this place either finds Sri Lankan authenticity too demeaning or a nuisance to be bothered with). The cafe and Italian across the road, which was part of the hotel, again had very limited menu which meant that they hardly had any punters despite being at prime location and wonderful setting. 

On the whole, it was an underwhelming experience to say the least. It seemed that the management is trying hard to cater to western clients forgetting the fact the clientele are there to have an essential Sri Lankan experience.  The food offering is poorly thought through. And it might sound controversial but perhaps, they don’t want coloured guests, so I would avoid this place if you are not white as the experience reminded us of a colonial mindset (I know I’m saying this in 2025 but that’s how we felt).","A big disappointment!","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r998766173-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Made the mistake of dining over the road at the hotels cafe/ restaurant. 

Ordered a couple of cocktails, couple of starters, couple of mains and  later -a bottle of wine.
Cocktails arrived after 30 minutes - another couple arrived and these cocktails went to them! Further 15 minutes they arrived,starting to get concerned now because no sight of any service relating to the food.
After some encouragement, cajoling the starters arrived and within a few minutes we were informed that the main course were ready!!!

Not having finished our long awaited starters, we reluctantly accepted ( Didn’t want the food sitting on the side of the bench in the kitchen)

Couldn’t believe that one of the mains was cold - what a fiasco.
Manager happened to pass by, same time, all smiles , were we all well etc He got quite a shock to find out we were not!
Useless!
It’s not lower level staff that need sorting out - they will follow their lead
 Breakfast at the hotel, very uninspiring but ( because no one was going to ask me) I got up and asked the supervisor ( Who had been catching up with the head chef at breakfast, and quite a lot must be going on because they had a lot to chat to each other about)  Sarcastically I asked him if he worked here? He confirmed that he did work there and I duly ordered the coffee.

I never saw that guy again and of course, never got a cup of coffee.

Compared to the hotels we had been staying at the service was extremely poor and we were glad we didn’t stay here for longer. The rooms however are very modern and nice. We had great beach views and the hotel in general is very well kept. The hotel is on the beach so you have the option to relax at the pool and wonder onto the beach as well. The only disappointment was the service in general and food options for vegetarians. We waited close to an hour for one snack at the bar and it wasn’t full or at peak time. The bar menu had very limited options for vegetarians and they didn’t have some of these available too. The main restaurant buffet had very few vegetarian options too so we opted for the a la carte menu which was ok for one night. In general the buffet was a lot smaller to what we had seen at other hotels. The service was poor at reception, not very welcoming and they didn’t really seem bothered. Perhaps this was down to us staying one night but as paying customers we would have expected much better. I wouldn’t call this a five star hotel as the service and food for vegetarians wasn’t good enough.

The reason given for the early checkout and the unprepared rooms was that a company named MASS had planned their stay, which we found to be quite inconvenient. As paying customers, we expected a higher level of service and were not satisfied with these issues. We did not come here to hear excuses. Overall, it was a very disappointing trip, and I cannot recommend this place to anyone.

Please avoid overbooking. It seems that prioritizing larger companies and neglecting accommodation for small families is driven by a desire for more revenue.

We were shown to a table in the corner with no apology or explanation. Not one staff member acknowledged our anniversary, we weren’t even offered a complimentary drink or dessert - it was a total letdown.  The food was nice enough, but  on the other 3 nights at Negombo we ate delicious dinners at nearby restaurants, the combined cost of which was less than one meal at the Heritance!!
The dining room staff lack basic training. At all our 4 breakfasts, we had issues, a couple of examples - no place setting on the table we were seated at (3 waiters watched on as I took cutlery from another table, not moving a muscle to help), we ordered two white coffees and received 2 glasses of water!!

Whilst your terms mentions that the hotel has the option to decide if the meal plan will be a la carte or buffet, it was not communicated that no buffet would be provided for yesterday's stay.  When we called the hotel on 26th October at 3.53 pm (refer call log screenshot below) to clarify about the check in time, request for early check in and to clarify what time the buffet ends, no mention was made of the meal plan being a la carte and were in fact told that the check in after 2pm will not affect our ability to avail ourselves of the lunch buffet. This was also never communicated to us when I contacted the central reservations team to reconfirm my online booking (refer email trail below). 

To make matters worse, the standard of the food served for lunch and dinner on a la carte basis was absolutely unacceptable for a 5 star hotel dining experience. Some of my concerns included the portion sizes of the starters and mail, the quality of the soups being something I can cook up at home, and the general lack of creativity and appeal of what one would expect to be served at a 5 star hotel. In fact, the meals we had would not even pass a 3 star meal service inspection if I am being brutally honest, no offence to anyone. Even the butter was not real butter, it was margarine, how very sad.

Finally, I must bring to your attention that even the room was not to the standard of a 5 star hotel. There was no bath robe or room slippers, the hair dryer was missing (we called and asked for one and was provided with a old and worn out hair dryer, why was the room not inspected before release to a guest?). Even the mini bar was empty. The pool circulator was also switched off on both yesterday and today and as a result the water was very heavy with contaminants.

Heritance Negombo is more expensive and the service is worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not stay at Heritance Negombo. I travelled from the UK to Negombo and stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. It was the worst experience that I’ve ever had staying at a hotel.

During my stay, I woke up to noises of someone knocking on a door. Thinking it was mine, I woke up at 3am and heard loud, banging noises coming from outside my room. When I looked through the peep hole, there was a man waking around outside my room. I also heard noises from the room next door of furniture being dragged around. I decided to call reception from the phone in the hotel room, the phone rang and no one picked up. I called reception at least 4-5 times and all I got was an engaged tone.  At this time, the individual was still outside my room. 

Due to fear of safety, I decided to call my mother in law who was staying in the room next door. She also called reception many times and no one picked up. At this point, I could hear the individual walking around outside the room and whistling. I decided to call my parents who were staying with relatives and they decided to drive down to the hotel. My parents also called the hotel 10 times and, still, no one answered. My parents arrived at the hotel and went to reception to find the receptionist sleeping in the room next door. We asked to speak to the hotel manager, Mr Prasanna Silva, and we were not able to get through to him. We asked to speak to the security manager and they took c.30-40 mins to arrive. Eventually, we requested to see the security footage and we saw house keeping cleaning rooms at 3am. The hotel gave us no indication that rooms will be cleaned at this time and we did not even receive an apology. The staff did not take responsibility nor do anything to rectify this situation.

I requested that we speak to Mr Prasanna Silva, the front office manager, in the morning before we checked out as we had a flight to catch at 8am. He was no where to be seen at the hotel, he did not call to apologise for what had happened. When I eventually spoke to him, He merely told me that “nothing happened, no one tried to come in to your room, and therefore you should pay full price”. He communicated with me in a very rude and disrespectful manner, as I told him that I refuse to pay full price for my stay as I did not receive the 5* service this hotel somewhat suggests. I told Mr Prasanna that I would not be paying for the 2 x rooms for that night as neither myself or my mother in law slept that night. This was dealt by the hotel by calling the police and the whole security team arriving and surrounding my car to stop us from leaving. 

I was told that the hotels General Manager advised the hotel to call the police. They treated us as if we were thieves. It was the most horrific and distressing experience that I’ve ever faced during my stay in a hotel. It created a lot of stress for me and my family. 

The management of this hotel need to take FULL responsibility for what happened during my stay. Fortunately, I was safe and nothing happened. If someone was in danger or in need of help, there would be no one to help or even take responsibility. It is a huge security issue and disturbance to ask staff to clean rooms at 3am in the morning. Not only did it cause distress for myself, I was disturbed because of the noise that was made. It is unsafe for women who are staying by themselves. 

If you are looking to stay in a hotel in negombo, I recommend Jetwing Blue. Great staff and service. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked at the time I was staying and therefore stayed in this so called “5 star hotel”.","Poor safety and security for guests - lack of responsibly and accountability","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r908997429-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We came to Heritance mainly because we love the pool. Unfortunately the water was not clean - 2m visibility, murky greenish hue. And the smaller connected pool was closed as a third of the tiles are missing. One poor guy working at the swim up bar to service the whole outside area, whope six people stand around washing windows.

The price of everything was 2-3x other hotels. The rooms are more expensive. Wine at 12000LKR being sold for 8000LKR at neighbouring Jetwing. Massage for USD60 per hour is USD15 at Hilton. Burgers are USD20, elsewhere USD10. A humble coconut that sells for 100rupees on the street is sold for 600rupees plus service charge and taxes.

There are hardly any guests staying here, so they are cutting corners. Half the dinner and breakfast buffet is closed off, so the selection is poor. Much worse than Cinnamon or even Hilton.

Management and reception was a nightmare. They messed up our booking, took no responsibility for it, and then asked us to pay extra for our kid to have a bed that we had already paid for.

The heart of the problem is the hotel is near empty. So to make money, they just gouge you and then ask for tips. They don't have the people, so they aren't fixing the pool or providing at the buffets. Go somewhere else.","Price gouging, poor service, limited buffet and pool not maintained.

When asking for the dinner buffet during the week too, the (honest and expected) response was that it is only profitable during the weekend when external guests show up!  The breakfast buffet - by the way - has been reduced too when compared to our former stay (same argument as before).  

Furthermore, the overall service was inconsistent: some days a turn-down service was delivered with fresh towels at the evening, some other days nobody showed up. Also, getting a refill of coffee and tea at breakfast was quite difficult: at the end we most often needed to get up and approach one of the staff asking for a refill. 

On the positive side: the staff has been very friendly and ready to help.

The Hill Club is not a hotel but a club and should NOT be considered for any stay. The curtains and carpets are threadbare and the place smells mouldy. No fridge in any rooms. No air conditioners in any room.

Set on a hill amongst beautiful sculptured gardens, it looked very old colonial British.  The reality was, as we soon discovered, it was more like Fawlty Towers!

Everything inside is tired and worn.  The carpets have holes, the chairs have dips in the cushions and walls are scuffed.  

Our ‘welcome’ briefing actually had the opposite effect.  The tea was nice, but being told what to wear and when was disconcerting.  Some people knew there was a dress code, however we hadn’t been informed.

Anyway, because we hadn’t packed ball gowns we ate in the casual dining room (that was small and packed), with exactly the same menu as the formal room directly next store (that was large and almost empty). Ridiculous.  The evening meal was pure Fawlty Towers mayhem - orders all over the place, corked wine, average or inedible food, mix ups, over an hour for food to arrive, etc.  Our group universally agreed it was terrible. 

The wifi is hopeless - and they have a corkage charge if you’d brought your own drinks!  However, there’s no fridges in the rooms anyway.  And weirdly, our bathroom door had a deadlock! 

The positives - the staff were lovely and tried hard. They gave all the women flowers to celebrate International Women’s Day.  They left cookies and put hot water bottles in your bed during the turn down service!

This place might have been grand once, but it desperately needs a make over.  Also, it needs to decide if it’s a club or a hotel that is actually welcoming for guests.  They can’t expect to maintain a posh persona, when it’s not of a standard that warrants it.","Not Up to the Standard They Expect of Guests","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d447505-r997333862-The_Hill_Club-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

This was my second stay in 15 years at the Hill Cub and where as I thought it might have improved as it stated 4 * forget it!

The exterior is beautiful  and I can understand the attraction of keeping the charm of colonial feel for the tourists but seriously you need to get rid of the senior staff running the place and get staff who know how to greet and deal with customers.  

The interior requires a massive makeover, the carpets throughout the hotel are torn and worn.  There is no heating or air conditioning anywhere (and boy it can get really chilly at night.)  The bathrooms are very basic with broken tiles and can again get really cold.  You can't let any fresh air in as there are rats running up and down the water channels directly under the windows and we were afraid they would come in.  The food is second rate, frozen and cheap and even if you had the best chef in the world, they would not be able to serve anything palatable from what are they provided with.  The rest of the staff are wonderful and very amenable.

As a warning to anyone with food allergies, do not just rely on informing the senior staff of the nature of your issues, tell the more junior staff as they take note and relay it to the other staff members.  One of our party has a severe peanut allergy, which we had informed the hotel of not just prior to our visit  reminded them twice during our arrival.  Needless to say this was information was not passed to the relevant catering and serving staff and on the last night of our stay a desert with peanuts was placed.  We caught the fact that peanuts were in the dish before a mouthful was taken but when we addressed our waiters over the fact, they told us that neither they or the caterers had been informed of the issue.  Upon calling and speaking to the manager regarding the near miss he was apologetic but basically useless in addressing the matter.

We arrived at reception and were asked to complete a form, detailing our passport information and contact telephone number. We declined to give this information as we didn’t feel it was necessary to have a quick drink. While I was filling in part of the form, the guide took my (exceptionally expensive) camera and without asking permission, took photos. 

We really just wanted a drink but were pushed into a tour of the ground floor of the hotel at a cost of 300 rupees per person.  The hotel is like stepping back in time and we certainly wouldn’t choose to stay there.  The tour lasted about 10 minutes and that was more than enough for us, it was so boring. The guide continually pointed out pictures of our queen….as if we didn’t know who she was!  We were then guided into the bar. My husband went to the gents and the guide stood at my side the whole time.  Even when my husband came back he continued to stand which was more than awkward.  We then realised he wanted a tip so husband gave him some money. Would you believe he still stood and my husband said “exactly how much more do you want”. We paid him again and he left us. The tip cost 5 times the price of the tour!

Half way through the tour the guide went down the dangerous path of guessing our ages, not something I would expect from someone I met 5 minutes ago.  To my astonishment, he said “ I’m sure you would have looked much prettier when you were younger”. I was horrified at his rudeness.  To make matters worse, the guide could do with addressing his hygiene as the smell of BO was quite overpowering.  

I had a gin and tonic that I could not finish as the tonic was rancid (penguin I think).  We could not wait to get out the hotel. 

This experience was the only bad one we had during our 4 week stay.   

This hotel makes an attempt at being special but for us, the experience was poor.","Rude tour guide, over priced and bad G&Ts","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d447505-r940641403-The_Hill_Club-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

1. Regrettably, the behavior of the bartender - though probably not wilfully ill-mannered - did not meet the high standard claimed by the establishment. Their attitude was a noticeable departure from the polished and professional demeanor one would expect in such a refined setting (hugging and kissing clients on the cheek is NOT okay, and bluntly asking if the clients are a couple or friends is a bit odd in such environment). It was disappointing to have interactions that did not align with the upscale nature of the place.

2. Worth noting that the cocktails were pricey (LKR ~4,000-5000, ~USD 12-15 at the time of this comment)
