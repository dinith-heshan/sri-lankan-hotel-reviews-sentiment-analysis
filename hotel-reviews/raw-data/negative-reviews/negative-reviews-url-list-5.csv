We understand from your remarks that you were seeking a budget-friendly option and had reserved the remainder of your stay accordingly. Unfortunately, we were unable to meet your expectations regarding price.

Thank you for your feedback. We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. As the resort had just opened, we were hosting a grand opening event to express our gratitude's to the well-wishers who contributed in many ways to make this project sucessfull irrespective of many hurdles like COVID and economic crisis of Sri Lanka . We totally understand your concern and this kind of events will not be repeated again.

To compensate for the inconvenience, we provided a considerable discount on your room charge and we hope you have considered this as our genuine gesture. We deeply regret that this event affected your stay, and we are committed to improving our services to ensure a more enjoyable experience for all our guests in the future.

We appreciate your understanding and hope to have the chance to welcome you back for a more peaceful stay.

The resort opened just last month and was not yet 100% ready but it was enough to offer most of the services. 
The location is fantastic, room brand new, great pool and right on the beach. High price but consistent with the service offered.

Unfortunately we found out that during our whole stay, the owner was organising a non stop party with relative and friends (representing more than 80% of hotel capacity) for some celebration. This was drawing completely the attention of the whole staff, dinner was not available for us because staff was preparing food for the group (we were suggested to go eat outside), laundry service not available (but for party group yes) and no sleeping until midnight every night because of loud music again for entertaining owner friends and relatives.
After I complained I got some symbolic discount and lots of “sorry” from hotel management but me and my family (2 adults and 2 kids) were feeling for 3 days like being in a private party in the home of someone else in which we were not invited.

This behaviour is totally unacceptable and unprofessional for a so called 5 star luxury resort in which I paid full price and where it was much more important to entertain the owner and his friends than to offer a relaxing stay to its customers.","Beautiful brand new resort but totally unprofessional behaviour from owner","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d28052030-r966273371-Uppuveli_Beach_By_Dsk-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

Regarding the spread of food - flavorless, bland and without much to imagine.

Cannot put into words how disappointing this experience was. How we call this a five star hotel is beyond my wildest understanding.

But the breakfast was horrible. it was the worst breakfast buffer ever. the layout at the restaurant is so bad. there is hardly any space between the food served and island with food kept. Even the tables were so close to each other. I think the breakfast was over crowded and was so chaotic. It took us so much time to get our food from live counter. The tables were also messy and unclean. The bakery option for breakfast was so bad, it looked so old like the item was bad days before.

Do yourself a favour and stay anywhere else in Colombo, especially if you are a woman traveling alone. 

At Taj Samudra, there are a multitude of men in suits whose apparent job it is to make solo women travellers feel intimidated in this hotel. After ordering a poolside G&T, I was accused by 3 different men (in suits) of not being a registered guest at the hotel, despite showing them my registration confirmation. They arrived one at a time while I was sitting by the pool in my bathing suit, and the last man was beyond angry, argumentative, and rude. When I'd finally had enough and went inside to complain, they were all arguing around a computer and not ONE of them offered an apology. 

After my experience at the pool, I had a lovely dinner across the street at the Galle Face Hotel. I went to bed early, only to have two separate men knock on my door. I did not open the door, I just shouted that I was in BED! This made me rather nervous on top of everything else. 

I chose this property for its location by the sea and the pretty pool area, but I spent most of my time (and money) across the street at the Galle Face Hotel where I was treated kindly and with respect. (Stay there and not the Taj Samudra!) The Galle Face Hotel is genuine and historic. You might pay a little more, but it's worth it for the charm. 

To be fair, one gentleman in management at Taj Samudra did his best to try and right things. Chaminda Dehiwatte went out of his way to try and get me to chat with the Manager about my treatment, but I'd already had enough. He approached me when I was checking out to switch to a different hotel, and he tried his best to smooth things over, but again, it was too late. Mr. Dehiwatte offered me a free buffet lunch, which I declined – instead, I suggested he take one of my room nights off my bill. He did, which was nice but it still was a really crappy experience.

The pool was indeed lovely, but on the first day they were setting up for a wedding and it felt like being on a construction site.    

Are here good things about the hotel? My room overlooking the sea was nice and clean. The housekeeping staff did a good job, and were friendly. If you want a large Indian wedding, this could be a great place. If you want a peaceful home base in Colombo, stay absolutely anywhere else.","Single female travelers, avoid at all costs. This hotel is India, not Sri Lanka.","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r997309635-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We stayed in a sea-view room with a stunning view, but the balcony was dirty, and the bathroom fixtures were in poor condition.

The breakfast buffet is vast, with excellent Sri Lankan hoppers and breakfast rolls, but the Indian options were disappointing—some dishes were undercooked or overdone. A smaller menu with better quality would be preferable.

The hotel seemed severely understaffed, leading to long delays in room service.

I'll start with the check-in experience. It was kind of okay, it was quick but lacked that warmth which is always appreciated. It felt like everything including the ambience was very busy. People were just running around here and there. There was someone offering welcome drinks and hot towels the next day but we were not offered anything when we checked in. Similarly, we had to wait in the lobby for someone to guide us through the hotel to our room and this whole sequence gave us the feeling like we are not welcomed there. Just want to emphasize that no one was rude, it's just that the hospitality (which we thoroughly enjoyed at Taj Bentota) was missing. Everything felt very transactional, like a commercial-only engagement. 

Dining Experience: 
The food tasted AWESOME!
Was everything great there? No! We went to Navratan (the Indian speciality restaurant) for dinner and was kind of taken aback by the appearance of the restaurant. It was themed like an Indian restaurant but the aesthetics could have been better. For example, there was even no false ceiling at the venue, it looked very dim-lit, downtrodden kind of a place. On top of that, the hospitality here was again missing. The serving staff again sounded very transactional which was in complete contrast with our experience at Taj Bentota. There the staff was not just welcoming but very cheerful too, the serving staff, the chefs everyone greeted us with a smile. That smile was totally absent over here. Even though the food tasted to notch, the presentation was way below the expectation. For example, we ordered Dahi Kebab for starters, for pieces arrived with just the salad, the server served us the kebabs and took the salad away. We even had to ask for mint chutney which should have accompanied the starter. Afterall, mint chutney is the holy grail of all the starters.

Our 1 and a half year daughter was also with us at the dinner. Now, I've been to many Taj properties earlier and it had been my experience consistently that if you are staying at the property, in that case the accompanying child eats for free. My experience at all other properties was even elevated because the Chef himself used to come to us to take the order for the baby so that he can prepare the food just like how the baby's mother intends it to be. Be it Taj Exotica Goa, Cidade De Goa, Taj Lakefront Bhopal or our last destination Taj Bentota, this experience was constant. It made us believe that this is a global Taj policy and hence we ordered for the baby just like we are used to of ordering. We were shocked when the check was presented to us as it included the pricing for the full portion (not even half) for the baby too. When I asked the manager about the same, their answer was plain and straightforward that we charge for everything. Now it's not like that I cannot pay out in not willing to pay that amount, my concern is related to the experience which is not the same as other Taj Hotels. Whenever I recommend hotels to my friends (who all are young parents btw), I always highlight them this fact as an USP that Taj chefs prepare for for babies as per your will and they don't even charge for it. Infact I stayed in Ginger hotel once, and even they did not charge for the food my baby had at their restaurant. They didn't even charge for a soft dosa which I ordered through IRD for my daughter. Not just Ginger, at all other properties, even IRD, milk etc was never changed for the baby. I needed some clarity about the policy, if there's one, so I went to chat with the front desk, unfortunately, they were again clueless about the same. They later called the Director F&B (Mr Abhishek Chatterjee, if I remember the name correctly), who was the only charming person (apart from the guy at concierge desk) at this property. He also didn't knew if any such policy exists or not but he took the responsibility that he'll find out and took that time also made sure that the items ordered for the baby are not charged. To be fair, our dining bill was also revised. However, the clarification is still pending about the exact policy. It should be clarified as we don't want to communicate incorrect information as recommendation.

I also booked a Taj Club room going by the description that it allows access to the Taj Club. I thought I'll get a taste of some added benefits by availing this room as there were other cheaper options available. The first time I went to Taj Club, no one was at reception, when I went inside and called 'hello' two folks appeared, out of them one was really a character as he was trying to be way too smart. When I said no one was at reception, he quickly said that desk is not operational. If that's the case, it should be mentioned on the desk itself. From there, a vicious sequence of being over smart in every answer started. I was told that babies are not allowed in the Taj Club. If that's the case, then you should not take booking with a child guest for the Taj Club Room. If you are taking the booking then you should extend the services. Anyways, nothing except coffee and stake cookies were available and he guy offered to send it to our room so we agreed to it. Now, next day, when I thought I'll not be a pain to the guys so went in there and asked them to send the coffee to the room, this time, I was again told a rule (by a new executive) that they cannot send the things to the room. In summary, in just two days I was told that I cannot be at Taj Club with a baby but can avail the services at the room on the first day and the next day was told that I cannot be at Taj Club nor I can avail the services in my room as well. Unfortunately, not much literature is available on your website about Taj Club from where I could have confirmed the exact rules. In short, I've only wasted my money by booking a Taj Club room it seems, I could have picked any cheaper option and it would have been just the same! 

Not everything was bad! The lady at the IRD was very polite. The food was so amazing that even after having such a bad experience on the first day, we again sent for Paneer Lababdaar and Cheese Garlic Naan ( this time through IRD) and the food was again smashing! I've not had such rich Cheese Garlic Naan anywhere. 

Points to improve: 
Hospitality/Smiles
Policies should be inline with other Tajs
Rules and regulations about Child food and Taj Club should be clarified

Thank you!

The room had really bad flooring, dirty corners, with paint patching all over the switches. The wooden furniture was not been maintained at all, and the glass table had all the paint patches also. Along with that wiring was messy and instead of cleaning the switch board they have painted it white. The Ac vent was broken and filthy, seems like not been cleaned since the hotel opened up.

We truly appreciate your comments. Guest feedback is very important to us because it is the best way to know how we should focus our efforts for continuous improvement.

We regret to hear that your stay with us did not live up to the expectations you rightfully hold for Occidental Eden Beruwala. The situation you described at check-in is certainly not reflective of our standards, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the unexpected shift from your original hotel booking. We understand that first impressions are crucial, and it seems we missed the mark in delivering the seamless and welcoming experience we strive for.

Moreover, we are sorry to hear that the room you received did not meet the level of comfort we aim to provide. We offer a variety of accommodations, each with distinct features such as breathtaking ocean views and spacious living areas meant to enhance our guests' stays. It is disappointing to know that the room assigned did not align with the upgraded experience you were promised, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion regarding this matter.

Finally, the absence of our manager's follow-up falls short of our commitment to guest satisfaction and we are truly sorry for this oversight. Please rest assured this does not reflect our usual high standards.

Nonetheless, we are delighted that you enjoyed the beautiful beach location of our hotel. Our beachfront property is indeed a gem in Beruwala, and we are glad that this aspect of your stay was positive.

We are hoping to welcome you back in the future.

We were booked into the Thaala hotel a few miles down the coast, but an air conditioning failure there caused us to be bumped to the Eden. To compensate, we were promised an upgrade room.
Arriving at the Eden, it was complete chaos - looked like an airport departure lounge with people and suitcases everywhere. Eventually we were shown to our room, which was completely and totally basic.  I queried it being a standard room, which they agreed it was, so I explained we had been offered an upgrade. Suddenly they claimed the room was an upgraded one - allegedly because of the sea view.  Looking at the hotel, it would appear all the rooms had sea views, so don't really understand the logic here.
Since it belongs to a large chain, I knew we weren't going to get any sense, and we were only staying one night, so we accepted the room.  Our tour guide contacted the manager, who said he would come and talk to us. Needless to say, he didn't........

В номерах при заезде было грязно, белье и полотенца темные, работала только одна розетка, полок нет вообще, одежду абсолютно некуда положить, в 139 номер не приносили зубные наборы и воду!
Входные двери в номера вздутые/деформированные от сырости, обои в номерах в темных пятнах от сырости!!!
По сути нам принесли не дополнительные кровати , а раскладушки со старыми дырявыми и вонючими матрасами, номера ужасно маленькие по площади , это максимум соответствует 3*

06.01 после неоднократных просьб нам предложили другие номера в этом отеле, но так как они не отличались , мы ОТКАЗАЛИСЬ ОТ ПЕРЕСЕЛЕНИЯ !","Никому не рекомендую!!!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r988153832-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your review.

We are truly sorry to hear that your stay did not entirely meet your expectations. Your comfort is our top priority, and we regret that the noise from the nearby event disturbed the peace you deserved. We understand how important a good night's sleep is and apologize for the discomfort caused by the pillows. 

Regarding the beach, we strive to maintain the highest standards of cleanliness and regret that we fell short of these during your visit. We appreciate your feedback on the dining experience for vegetarians and the attentiveness of our staff. We acknowledge that every guest deserves an exceptional level of service and it seems we have missed the mark. 

Nonetheless, we are pleased that you enjoyed the quality of your room and the beautiful views it offered. It delights us to know that Dammika's service stood out positively during your dining experience. Our team takes great pride in our hotel's amenities and the serene vistas of the pool and Indian Ocean that many of our guests love.

Finally, we take note of your comments regarding the bathroom and the efficiency of our room service. Please accept our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience these issues may have caused.

We were so looking forward to these two days! Extremely disappointing! The room was good, view of the pool and a bit of the Indian Ocean visible from our room! The day we checked there was a party and the sound was so loud all the way up till late in the night! Pillows were another matter!! No sleep! 

We hoped for a good beach to relax before we headed back home! A very dirty beach! There were things washed up and not cleaned at all! Either they are short staffed or not used to giving the best hospitality! This place lacked everywhere! 

We had requested for a vegetarian food right throughout our trip and were never disappointed except for here. Food spread was good but hardly anything for vegetarians! And hospitality was at its lowest. Except for Dammika in the restaurant who was very attentive, it was as if no one really cared! Someone came up to us and told us that they would speak to the chef to organise some food but alas nothing came of it!! Just when we were heading out someone came in to ask if everything was ok!! 

The bathroom leaks. No one bothered to check. Cleaning service wasn’t great as the room was still sandy as ever. Ask for any extra coffee and it takes atleast two calls to the front desk!

Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel.

We are sorry that your stay did not fully meet your expectations. We understand that waiting for a room, especially when traveling with children, can be quite taxing; we aim for each guest to be accommodated promptly and comfortably upon arrival, and we regret any inconvenience caused by the delay.

Moreover, it is disappointing to learn of your experience at our restaurant. Our goal is to always provide prompt and accessible dining options, and we will certainly review our seating arrangements to better serve our guests during peak times.

We are concerned to hear about the issues with your room's condition and size. Our rooms are designed to provide a relaxing and clean environment, and what you described falls short of the standards we strive for. Additionally, the unpleasant odor from the bathroom is not reflective of our hygiene protocols, and we will be looking into this matter immediately.

We are sincerely sorry that the service did not meet your expectations. We will follow up on this with our team to ensure that each guest's experience is seamless and enjoyable.

We hope to welcome you again in the future.

Additionally, when we went to the restaurant for dinner around 7:30 PM, there were no tables available. We had to wait for 20 minutes before finding a place to sit. The hotel's management clearly struggled to handle a large number of guests when fully occupied.

The rooms were small, not clean, and there was an unpleasant smell coming from the bathroom.

We truly appreciate your comments. Guest feedback is very important to us because it is the best way to know how we should focus our efforts for continuous improvement.

We apologize for your stay not meeting all your expectations. We regret to hear about the inconvenience you faced with the fitness centre amenities; our intention is always to provide a fully equipped and comfortable environment for our guests to enjoy their workouts. The absence of an ocean view from your superior room is certainly not up to our standards, and we understand the disappointment this may cause. Ensuring our guests receive the room type booked is a priority, and we will look into this matter to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, we acknowledge the oversight regarding the lack of in-room items such as an iron, slippers, and bathrobes and will address this with our housekeeping team. 

Nonetheless, we are pleased that you found our hotel suitable for families. Our aim is to offer a welcoming and enjoyable experience for guests of all ages, with amenities such as the children's pool, kids' club, and family-friendly room options. We hope that these aspects, along with our attentive service, contributed positively to your stay.

Nonetheless, we are fortunate to be located on the beautiful Beruwala Beach, which offers stunning views and a serene atmosphere for our guests to enjoy. We hope that the natural beauty of our beachfront location provided some enjoyment during your stay.

Last time had a great room overlooking the sea. This time I chose garden view but that is not what we got! I booked the trip in January so I do not know why we were given the worst room in the hotel overlooking a concrete roof and service area of hotel. Our hearts sank. We were told the hotel was fully booked but later found out that some other guests that arrived same day but later than us managed to move to a different room. The hotel was mainly full with locals. 
The locals left after the weekend and this is when we were able to move to a room with a balcony. This room had a run down bathroom with peeling chrome, leaking toilet and a mouldy shower curtain. In the previous room the air con unit was leaking and I slipped over as there was a big puddle on the floor. 

The food was of a very good standard while the locals were there but when they left the standard dropped massively . I understand not as many dishes can be prepared for less guests but the standard should not drop. No longer were there tasty fried prawns or nasi goreng. Even the chicken curry disappeared. .
We did not enjoy a single meal after the locals left, just ate to fill our stomaches.

I booked a pedicure and was told they don’t have machine for gel nails but can do varnish which was fine I said. I was shown into a room with all the nail colours laid out. My feet were put in a bowl of cold water . The lady quickly gave a get a run over with an  emery board. Didn’t get rid of dry skin at all. Then a quick application of oil  no massage. I was then given a clear coat of varnish an told it was finished. I stated I wanted a colour but was told the varnish was old and no good. Another disappointment as I had stated before hand that I wanted varnish. My husband returned to the spa to check the price list. Then the lady approached us to say she would now give me a colour??? I wished I had refused to pay because it just wasn’t good enough.

The staff in hotel are wonderful. So keen to please. That’s the only positive I can say.

This is NOT a five star hotel by any means.","So disappointed","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r957352684-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

On May 25 a burglar climbed up on my balcony and entered my room at approximately 04:30 in the morning while I was sleeping. He stole a bag with my passport, driver’s license, and cash. While departing he made a noise and woke me, but I could not catch him as he jumped from the balcony unto a ledge and got away.
The very disturbing parts: 1. Hotel staff must have unlocked the balcony glass door as had locked it that morning. 2. The surveillance cameras were not working on my balcony. 3. The top bolt of the room door was removed. When the check in staff was asked for a change of rooms due to this, they said the hotel was completely booked up. This was later proven to be untrue. 4. The safe did not work properly until reprogrammed by staff after the robbery. 5. Hotel staff were seen carrying a ladder outside the hotel near my room near the time of the robbery. The cameras facing the side of the hotel with my room were off. 6. A hotel housekeeping staff was seen near my room door near the time of the robbery. 7. The hotel guard near my room facing the beach said he saw nothing. 7. After the robbery hotel staff asked me “why was I in Sri Lanka”. They also repeatedly asked me to claim the items were “lost and not stolen as this would be easier”. Hotel security told me they needed information for the police report and asked my “home address and mother’s maiden name”. As I was there for my company opening a branch in Beruwala the hotel management later said, “if we had known who you were we would have given you a room this would not have happened in”. The hotel security said if I offered a reward, I likely would get my passport back. I replied I don’t reward criminals. 8. The newspaper the Daily Mirror ran an article immediately and identified me as well as what was taken and inferred the items were ‘laying around”. The items were right next to me as I slept. When I sent a response and comments to the Daily Mirror the did not publish them. On Instagram they could not prevent my replies. 
The actions by the hotel staff from check-in, housekeeping, security, and all levels of management were highly suspicious and very disturbing. 
I strongly advise if you are going to the Beruwala area and especially if you are in the gem trade do not stay at the Occidental Eden Hotel for your personal safety and the security of your valuables. And after this experience I would avoid any hotel under the management of the Barceló Hotel Group.","Safety and Security Alert of Occidental Eden Beruwala - a Hotel of Theft","2024-05","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r956452326-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

- Zustand Zimmer gesundheitsgefährdend
- alles ist nass/ feucht, Schimmel Sicht- und deutlich riechbar 
- Klimaanlage schimmelt und verteilt Schimmelgeruch im Raum
- Klimaanlage tropft 

Alles ist nass und riecht nach Schimmel. Das Zimmer ist ebenfalls nicht mehr im besten Zustand. Auf Beschwerde wurden uns VIER verschiedene Zimmer als Tauschoption gezeigt. Die Hotelleitung hätte uns auch ein kostenloses Upgrade in die nächsthöhere Zimmerkategorie (renoviert) gegeben. Jedoch wiesen alle Zimmer das gleiche Problem auf. Teilweise sogar mit offensichtlichen großen schwarzen Schimmelflecken. Es wurde eine „Reinigung“ angeboten woraufhin wir erklären mussten, dass nur eine Sanierung oder Renovierung hilft und keine einfache Zimmerreinigung. Die Begründung des Managers hieß, dass „Asthma Patienten einen Raum ohne Tapete bekommen könnten“, dabei war auch im weiß gestrichenen Zimmer zu sehen, dass Schimmelflecken einfach nur mit Farbe übermalt werden.
Die Klimaanlage verbessert das Problem nur bedingt. Sie stinkt ebenfalls nach Schimmel und man sieht es auch offensichtlich, dass die Sporen dadurch verteilt werden. Außerdem tropft diese bei Benutzung den Zimmerboden voll. 
Man hat das Gefühl, dass man sich in ein nasses, klammes Bett setzt.
Wir baten darum das Hotel zu verlassen und unser Geld wieder zu bekommen. Da das Hotel über TUI gebucht ist, war dies leider nicht möglich. Wir entschieden uns in unserem Zimmer zu bleiben und der Manager bot uns ein Upgrade zur Halbpension an.
Nach einer Nacht im Hotel ist die Stimmung leider mehr als am Boden, alle sind mit Kopfschmerzen aufgewacht und der Urlaub ist gelaufen. So ein schlechtes Hotel hatten wir auf unser Rundreise durch Sri Lanka noch nie.","EINMAL UND NIE WIEDER!","2024-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r956129555-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

We appreciate that you took the time to share your experience with us.

We regret to hear about the issues with the window in your room and the subsequent inconveniences you faced, including the unwanted noise and presence of mosquitos. While our team strives to ensure prompt resolution to such concerns, we are saddened that our efforts did not meet your expectations. 
Regarding the alternative accommodations offered, it is disheartening to learn that they did not align with the comfort and quality that we aim to provide. The availability of rooms is an aspect we monitor closely, and we apologize for any miscommunication that may have occurred during your stay. 
We also take note of your observations regarding the beach area. Please be assured that our eco-friendly initiatives are designed to maintain the cleanliness and natural beauty of our surroundings. 
Your comments on the bedding are disconcerting, and we will certainly reflect on the standards of our linens. We believe that every guest deserves a pristine environment, and we will continue to strive for excellence in this regard.

We look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back on future occasions.

-  My room was facing the street, nearby ventilation releasing discharge air of kitchen (s. pictures) - thus a very bad smell, very noisy, mosquitos in my room due to window not closing - could not sleep. 

-  The hotel was unable to repair the window, the employees at the reception did not take it seriously: I  made them aware of that on the first evening and after the failed try of what they called 'engineers' was left to sleep in this room. I was then offered one other room after I asked again after the first night which was in a bad condition with an open hallway on the ground floor in a worse category  than the one I had. According to the hotel there were no other rooms available but according to one of the biggest booking portals there were several rooms available (not just suites) so the hotel could have easily provided me with a different room of either the same or the next category above, but was probably hoping to rent them out with the upcoming weekend. They claimed there must be a mistake on the booking site but I checked several times and there were rooms available, even after I had made them aware of there still being rooms available, which would have given them the opportunity to correct this if it really was incorrect. The hotel has in the meantime claimed I was offered several other rooms of a higher category which I did not like, which is absolutely untrue and absurd. I was just offered this one other room of a worse category until I was then given a room of the same category on day 3.

- I was given stained bedsheets, the cleaning staff was so kind to change them but the hotel management should have disposed of stained sheets in the first place
 
-  This proves my overall impression of my stay there that the hotel is adhering to a policy of saving at all cost and dishonesty - ultimately at the customers' expense.

-  beach: wastewater directly in front of hotel spa is released onto beach and into ocean so I would recommend walking a little further also because it is directly situated at the mouth of a river","Defect Room / Bad customer service","2024-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r943885537-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Uns wurde vom Reiseleiter und vom Hotelguide das Geld aus der Tasche  gezogen..Bei einen durchschnittlichen Einkommen eines Singhalesen (230€) 180-150€ pro Person für einen Tagesausflug zu verlangen und zu argumentieren, dass man versichert sei, ist eine absolute Frechheit. Der Versicherungsfall ist eingetreten (Erkrankung) und wir bekamen lediglich 50% erstattet obwohl keinerlei Kosten entstanden sind.

Das erste Zimmer musste aufgrund der Lautstärke des Nachbarzimmers gewechselt werden, obwohl upgrade versprochen wurde gab es ein downgrade , das Zimmer war kleiner.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay at EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa. I regret that we did not meet your expectations and that you left feeling disappointed with your experience.

While I am glad you appreciated the stunning location and the views from your room, I am sorry to hear about the plumbing issues and other inconveniences you encountered. I have shared your concerns with our maintenance team to address these problems immediately.

Regarding the pricing of beverages and food, we strive to maintain a balance between quality and value, but I understand your perspective. Your comments will be reviewed as we continuously evaluate our pricing to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for our guests.

I also acknowledge your feedback about the pool size and lounging area. While our property emphasizes its heritage charm and lakeside tranquility, we will look into ways to enhance the relaxation spaces for our guests.

Queen Elizabeth’s visit in 1954 is indeed a cherished part of our history, but our goal is to create an experience worthy of the present, not just rely on the past. Your feedback serves as a valuable reminder that we have areas to improve, and I sincerely apologize for falling short during your visit.

Thank you once again for your honest feedback. Should you decide to visit Polonnaruwa again, I would be grateful for the opportunity to personally ensure a better experience for you.

Warm regards,
Nuwan Wijerathne

But starting from dinner the food was not tasty. The soup had too much salt, the lamb was over roasted and some of the desert tasted as if it had gone bad. We politely raised our concerns but no substitute was offered. Neither was an apology. During lunch the next day, we were served spring rolls that were half fried. This time we complained to the manager. He offered to fix the problem but again the main dish was poorly prepared. This is quite disappointing as local travelers we accept a standard of taste. No substitute for the mistakes were offered and we were charged full amount. Once complained again they gave us 10% off. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here for 3 full meals. The chef is incompetent and I honestly feel it’s a health risk to eat old food or undercooked food.

The view and the location of the hotel is great.

They will show you the suite Queen Elizabeth stayed in 1954 and give you a tour of the property. Wake up in the morning and go for a morning walk in the island group of monuments, located next door. The museum is also right here. Breakfast was fantastic.

So why 2 stars you ask? I had the most unexpected and unacceptable experience at checkout. At check in I had requested a late checkout to which the staff nodded and said ok. Come the day of check out, the same staff member changed his mind and asked me to leave early. I don’t think I am entitled to a late checkout, but if it is promised they better honour it.

When we were making check out - they charged us second time for 2 times more price (even higher then on booking!). So we paid triple. The hotel even didn’t suggest a discount. Although the manager said it was “50% his mistake - but guys you have to pay, I let you stay as I wanted to do business”.

Going through your review what I could gather is you have completely misunderstood the 
the concept of Ekho Lake House to the former Rest House. To make matters clear the former Rest House was refurbished 05 months ago and was converted as a top end luxury boutique property.As mentioned it has a fine dinning restaurant , though the reviewer has branded the property as a glorified road side rest house , it is situated in one of the best locations in Sr Lanka . Queen Elizabeth ii stayed in this property in 1954
during her short visit to Sri Lanka.
Sorry to mention the reviewer do not understand the concept between a 05 star hotel and a boutique property.Looking at the menu & price alone will not take you any where , if you do not experience it and to come to a conclusion.
The Team at Ekho Lake House is very proud about the comments received from the clients who have been served so far.   
The reviewer has failed to understand the concept of the hotel prior to making the decision to have lunch . Had the reviewer visited the website and understood the concept, the reviewer would have opted to choose another hotel.

Regards,

Sarath Wickremasinghe

Pathetic Rude Staff",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our experience at Shangri-La Hambantota was far from what one expects from a luxury resort and left us with a lasting sense of frustration and disbelief.
We were travelling with young children after a 12-hour journey, hoping for a smooth and welcoming check-in. Instead, we were met with one of the most disorganized and poorly managed check-ins we’ve ever encountered. Despite informing the hotel in advance and requesting an expedited process, there was simply no manpower or urgency from the staff. Mr. Kamindu at the front desk was completely clueless and indifferent, showing little regard for basic hospitality. When we requested an upgrade, he first claimed there was no availability and moments later said upgrades were available for a price—an inconsistency that spoke volumes about their priorities.
The rooms allocated to us were at the very end of a long corridor, at least a 5-minute walk from the lobby—highly inconvenient for a family with small kids. Worse, the rooms were in noticeably poor condition and in no way reflected five-star quality.
When we raised these concerns with the duty manager, Mr. Lakmal, the situation only deteriorated. Instead of listening or showing any sense of accountability, he was rude, dismissive, and shockingly arrogant. He refused to help, refused to acknowledge the genuine concern of accessibility for a family with children, and instead blamed us for not requesting a “more convenient room” at the time of booking. He even had the audacity to suggest we pay for a higher category room if we wanted basic convenience.
It was a masterclass in how not to handle guest issues. Mr. Lakmal’s attitude was not just unprofessional—it was shameful for someone representing a global hospitality brand. Basic courtesy, empathy, and common sense were completely absent.
This experience has not only left us disappointed but also deeply disillusioned with the Shangri-La brand. What should have been a relaxing family getaway was marred by sheer negligence, apathy, and arrogance from key staff.","Extremely Disappointing Stay – Arrogant Management & Substandard Service","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1013906528-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

But only fakes them selves as 5 star. 
1. At check in we found out that main pool was close for the maintenance. We requested them to Atleast give us usage at adult pool , that also they said no, they tell use the baby pool for famiily , which was only 2.5 feet depth. We even requested room upgrade for which they told me it will take 2 more hours to ready those rooms. Which 5 star property does this. I have been to Mariott Welagama and Taj Bentota both were amazing but this Shangrila Hambantota is worthless in customer experience. 
2. Food I suggest only book if u are NON VEGETARIAN EATER. The. Buffet have very limited choise for vegetarian and Indian vegetarian there were only 3 items on menu. . 75% items are non vegetarian . Trust me guys Indian vegetarian will die with hunger here , Jain people please avoid this place the whole area smells of meat and fish products. No proper exhaust. Vegetarian specially jain this hotel is strict no no . The chef was pre informed about our dietary requirement . But we got 1 extra paneer vegetable for all that effort. The chef did favour on us by making that also. We requested to Atleast give one vegetarian pizza because we had no option on buffet to eat, but they said the pizza is not on buffet and chargeable. What type of hospitality is this . The manager should understand that they already have limited option and not able to eat and inspite of supporting they asked for money. Disgusting hospitality and the manger is worthless being a five star. . 
3. Morning breakfast had 3 veg items . Only inspire of head chef knowing there are vegetarian guest also after all discussion following dinner in the night. , still they could not bake us 1 or 2 eggless pastries. After some talk chef managed to do a favour again by bringing some from kitchen. These guys provide but first they spoil the mood by saying not there and than do us favour by providing little . They make channa masala and when u asked what to eat with , they told me with thick dosa. Is he really a chef or what . Who eats channa masala with dosa . They could have baked some puris with channa masala . Senseless and weird. Just hiding their inability to cater properly. 
4. No proper tagging of allergies on food items . Things that contain eggs are just named and no sign of any allergiens in food being a 5 star is shocking . Did they hire head chef someone from 3 star hotel . Some items have eggs and it’s mentioned other have eggs and still not mentioned . Is it some sort of joke. 
5. WiFi sucks . Rooms air conditioning sucks . Property is under lots of maintenance . 
6. Duty managers are sleeping and unresponsive. They keep u wait for 15- 20 min to meet with them. Like they have paid us money to come here and attend them. 
INSHORT ITS A PARADISE FOR NON VEGETARIAN EATERS. Vegetarian should refrain from booking. You pay so much in name if 5 star property and they have such low standard for customer satisfaction 

Shangrila Team please mention on website that u can’t provide and cater to vegetarian. Buffet should have Atleast 50% veg on menu. Including pastries also. Go green and start serving vegan and vegetarian. Just saving papers and washing powders won’t make u green.","POOR VARIETIES OF VEGETARIAN FOOD.

We visited right after the local new year and it was over crowded. Staff clearly looked overworked and always annoyed or just waiting for the day to get over. Ask them anything they are annoyed. Whether it was cutlery, plaster, water, slightly late checkout or whatever you ask, we had to either wait or they come back with some excuse why they cannot provide it. You’ll be surprised at the lack of interest to serve local guests. A Smile on their face is something you’ll rarely find. 

Room is spacious but the sofas and bathroom floor are full of stains. Shower area drain gives a foul smell when not in use. Buffet was repetitive. We stayed for two nights on full board basis and were regretting due to lack of choice. Restaurant staff are just running around and if you try stopping them for a second to ask something they get annoyed. I showed a table and asked if it’s available and one male staff member point blank told me that he doesn’t know. Another time I stopped another male staff to ask for something and he stopped me with a hand signal until he gave cutlery to another. Never seen such unfriendly and poor service in any other five star hotel anywhere in the world. There was one chef who came to the tables asking if everything is ok and that was it. 

Our 4YO kid had a cut on her foot near pool and when we asked pool side bar staff for a plaster they just waited for a while and came back and said they don’t have plasters. They told us to go to the nurse and get plasters ourselves and said they are not allowed to ask for plasters from the nurse. My husband was annoyed since they took long to just say this and also we saw them passing the ball to each other who would go and say no to us. We were seated very close to the bar. When we asked the nurse if there is such policy that staff cannot ask for a plaster from the nurse for a guest, she said there is no such policy. What a lie!!!

 High time you give your staff a training or give them a proper rest or raise so they won’t be this frustrated and offer bad service all the time. 

Both my husband and I are premium category members of Hilton, Marriott and have experienced stays around the world but membership is so worthless and means nothing at Shangri-la Hambantota. They will follow the checklist and give you a proactive call to ask your preferences but make zero effort to fulfil it. They will also call you in the middle of the stay but again for checklist but won’t listen to what the member has to say. Will just say ok ok and hang up. Please stop calling your regular members to ask their preferences if you cannot meet them. Don’t set expectations if you cannot meet them. Waste of time for the hotel and member both.

We booked with my husband’s membership number and someone called him two days before asking our preference and for us it was kids pool access and higher floor. Day of the check in, we called the call Center to check our stay while we were driving there and the agent told us our room was assigned and  it was a number on 3rd floor. When we arrived, they have clearly stroke off the room number given to us by call Center and given us a lower floor room which we could see on the paper they gave us for signing. Then when we told them about this, they put us to a different room which was even further away from kids pool and on a lower floor. Finally they gave us a 4th floor room which was worn out. Also we checked out from Shangri-la app and were told that app is not in sync with hotel system. We had unpaid pool side bills and we could’ve left without knowing this.  

Please learn and upgrade membership service quality standards from other chain hotels operating in Sri Lanka like Marriott, who are genuinely making an effort when a member show up. Premium category or otherwise. If not scrap the membership so we will not expect international level experience from you or choose another international brand. 

Differential treatment for local guests was pretty obvious. The property was over crowded with locals so staff had differential and derogatory attitude towards local guests and ignored  most of the time  from front desk, room service, restaurant etc. which wasn’t the case for foreign guests. Giving a special local offer does not give you permission to treat locals with lower quality service. We didn’t ask for the discounted price at poor quality service. 

Only good things were the village area and kids play area and kids pool. Life guards were good, attentive and very friendly. Rest is 3 star service disguised in Shangri-La brand. 

If you’re a local who knows what international chain hotel brands offer, then rethink before you come here as it is not going to be a five star experience. Definitely not international. We won’t be back till we hear of tangible improvements.","Not the International Shangri-La experience.

Only a boy called Ranepura was very nice, along with majority of the staff. There were a few staff on the other hand who were pompous because we are locals. I noticed even in the kids play area there were many instances where foreign kids were prioritized and given more attention. Play area was a joke!! It's absolutely filthy!!!! Doesn't look like the place has gotten a deep clean in years.. I have been to three star hotels with better and cleaner common facilities.

I wouldn't be so annoyed if we didn't have to waste so much money on such a mediocre experience at a so called 5 star hotel - I'd like to see the criteria that make this hotel a 5 star hotel and see how it's continuously assessed and updated.

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We sincerely regret that your recent stay did not meet your expectations and that you encountered challenges with your booking, dining experience, and service requests.

With regard to your reservation, we acknowledge that you initially booked two rooms under the NTB 35% offer. The day prior to arrival, you requested to amend one of the rooms to a triple occupancy. Unfortunately, as the offer was already closed, the reservation team was unable to accommodate this change and advised booking an additional room. Given that the original promotional offer was no longer available, our central reservation team extended the best possible rate for your additional booking.

We are deeply sorry for the service lapses you faced, particularly the delay in dining arrangements, the lack of responsiveness to your requests, and the inconvenience at checkout. Please rest assured that we have taken this matter seriously and have addressed these concerns with our relevant teams to prevent such occurrences in the future.

Your feedback regarding the overall guest experience and operational efficiency is invaluable to us, and we will take the necessary corrective measures to ensure better service delivery. We truly regret that your special celebration was affected and would love the opportunity to regain your trust in the future.

First, the booking process was a disaster. We originally booked a Premier Ocean King Double Room and a Premier Ocean King Triple Room for LKR 56,550 and LKR 62,400 after a 35% discount. A few days before arrival, we needed to upgrade to a triple room. Instead of a simple amendment, we were forced to make a completely new reservation. Despite a 20% local resident discount, we were charged LKR 74,400 for a Deluxe Double Room—a lower category than our original booking! If that wasn’t bad enough, we had to pay for 7 people, even though we were only 6, because there were no single rooms. Completely unreasonable.

Then came the restaurant fiasco. We were told to wait 15 minutes outside, which we agreed to. But instead of honoring this, the receptionists let in other guests who arrived after us! We even saw a group of five being quietly told to enter in pairs to get ahead. After waiting patiently, we had to demand a table, which should never happen at a hotel of this reputation.

The lack of attention to guest needs was another huge disappointment. We requested shaving kits—called multiple times—but they were never delivered. Then, at checkout, despite several reminders, no one came to collect our baggage. We had to carry our own luggage to the reception. Ironically, a staff member picking up baggage from another room told us that his team was never even informed about our request!

The problem isn’t the staff—the ones we encountered were polite, but they were clearly exhausted. This is a management failure. If the hotel can’t handle the number of guests they book, they should stop overbooking.

This was meant to be a special celebration for our father’s birthday, but instead, it was a frustrating experience filled with unfair pricing, disorganization, and ignored requests. Definitely not the standard expected from Shangri-La.","Overbooked, Overpriced & Overwhelmingly Disappointing","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1000416173-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We sincerely regret that your recent stay did not meet your expectations and that you encountered challenges with your booking, dining experience, and service requests.

With regard to your reservation, we acknowledge that you initially booked two rooms under the NTB 35% offer. The day prior to arrival, you requested to amend one of the rooms to a triple occupancy. Unfortunately, as the offer was already closed, the reservation team was unable to accommodate this change and advised booking an additional room. Given that the original promotional offer was no longer available, our central reservation team extended the best possible rate for your additional booking.

We are deeply sorry for the service lapses you faced, particularly the delay in dining arrangements, the lack of responsiveness to your requests, and the inconvenience at checkout. Please rest assured that we have taken this matter seriously and have addressed these concerns with our relevant teams to prevent such occurrences in the future.

Your feedback regarding the overall guest experience and operational efficiency is invaluable to us, and we will take the necessary corrective measures to ensure better service delivery. We truly regret that your special celebration was affected and would love the opportunity to regain your trust in the future.

Shangri-La is a beautiful property, but unfortunately, our experience was not up to the expected standard due to booking issues, overpricing, and service failures.

We originally booked a Premier Ocean King Double Room and a Premier Ocean King Triple Room with a 35% discount. A few days before arrival, we needed to upgrade one room to a triple, but instead of a simple amendment, we were forced to make a completely new booking. Despite a 20% local resident discount, we were charged LKR 74,400 for a Deluxe Double Room, which is a lower category than what we had originally booked. This felt unjustified, and we were also required to pay for 7 people, even though we were a group of 6, simply because there were no single rooms.

Dinner service was frustrating. We were asked to wait 15 minutes, which we understood given how busy the hotel was. However, we were left waiting much longer, while multiple guests who arrived after us were seated first. One group of five was even told by the receptionist to split into pairs and enter quietly—which felt completely unfair.

Additionally, basic requests were ignored. We called multiple times for shaving kits, but they were never provided. At checkout, no one came to collect our baggage, despite our reminders. We ended up carrying our own bags to the reception, and a staff member handling another room’s baggage mentioned that his team was never informed about our request.

The staff we interacted with were friendly and hardworking, but it was clear they were stretched too thin. This seems to be a management issue, and we hope the hotel either employs more staff or limits bookings to what they can handle.

We truly wanted to enjoy this stay, especially as we were celebrating a special occasion, but the experience fell short of the high standards we expected from a Shangri-La property.","Wouldn’t Return or Recommend","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1000405858-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Booking Issues

We initially booked one Premier Ocean King Double Room and one Premier Ocean King Triple Room, costing LKR 56,550 and LKR 62,400 after a 35% discount. A few days before arrival, we needed to amend our booking to upgrade the double room to a triple room. However, we were told that amendments were not possible and that we had to make a completely new reservation.

Despite the 20% local resident discount offer, we were charged LKR 74,400 for a Deluxe Double Room, which is a lower category than our originally booked Premier Ocean King rooms. The pricing seemed significantly off, and it felt like we were overcharged. Additionally, we had to pay for 7 people, even though we were only a group of 6, because single rooms were unavailable. Since we were celebrating our father’s birthday, we had no choice but to proceed.

Restaurant Experience

Our frustration didn’t end with the booking. On the night of our stay, we arrived for dinner and were asked to wait outside for 15 minutes before being seated. We understood that the hotel was busy and waited patiently. However, even after 15 minutes, we were still not let in, while other guests who arrived after us were seated before us.

We even saw a group of five whom the receptionist secretly instructed to enter in smaller groups of two. At this point, we had no choice but to speak up to get a table. This was highly unprofessional and unacceptable—especially given that we had paid for 7 people, but they couldn’t even accommodate our actual group of 6.

Service Issues – Missing Requests & Checkout Problems

The lack of attention to guest requests was another major disappointment. We requested shaving kits since they were not available in the room, but despite calling multiple times, we never received them.

During checkout, no one came to collect our baggage from the rooms, despite multiple reminders. We had to carry our own bags to the reception. A staff member who happened to be picking up baggage from a nearby room kindly helped two of us. He mentioned that his team was never informed about our baggage collection request, which shows a clear lack of coordination.

Final Thoughts

While most of the staff were kind and helpful, they seemed overworked and overwhelmed. This is not their fault—this is a management issue. The hotel should either allocate adequate staff or limit the number of bookings to ensure proper service for all guests.

What was supposed to be a special celebration turned into an unnecessarily stressful experience due to poor booking policies, questionable pricing, disorganized restaurant service, and unresponsive housekeeping. We truly hope the management takes these concerns seriously and improves their service to meet the high standards expected from a hotel of this caliber.","Disappointing Experience with Overcharging and Poor Service","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1000403484-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

We paid for the full board dine around package yet had to fight for the right to eat at any other resturant than the main buffet restaurant. This resturant must have THE most un-imaginative, lazy executive chef on the planet. Breakfast is the same, day in, day out, seriously no changes and the coffee is awful. The juices are not much better. Yes Sri Lanka is an Asian island but the lunch menu is 90% curry, as is the dinner menu - seriously????  Currently sitting in the New Year's Eve gala dinner, which has a route 68 theme. No, I haven't heard of route 68 neither. I had to spit the sushi back onto my plate as I came close to vomiting, it was old and not freshly prepared. 

The main bar has plenty of room for more tables, yet is full with just a few tables and nowhere other than 2 bars to go to in the rain. Both have limited space.

The hotel made mistakes to my bill and I had to go through each item with a fine tooth comb to counter the mistakes. 

The food menus in the two bars lack imagination, and the 'selection' is minimal. The Chinese restaurant has great tasting food, but the service is SLOW. The staff stand around chatting. It took them 10 minutes to bring a menu, one hour for the food and even longer for the first round of drinks. 

There are a few waiting staff who care but most are poorly trained and start serving part of an order, then get distracted with someone else's and you have to ask for certain things in the pool bar at least twice before you get what you asked for

I will say that the room was clean and well appointed but that's the only highlight. Everything else is shockingly bad. 

There are spaces for shops but NONE are open. Be sure to bring enough sun cream and swimwear, you won't find anywhere even close to the hotel to buy any. 

Stay at this hotel at your peril and I will be amazed if Shangri-La associate their brand with this hotel for much longer. It is FAR from a five star hotel, three at best. We are very well travelled so we have stayed at a lot of good hotels to compare.

Food was great and staff kind and attentive (although reception staff seemed a little lost)
The huge down side was very stupidly we left money in a drawer which ended up being stolen
We didn't notice until the day after we left so nothing could be done about it. We did think it was strange the amount of times housekeeping wanted to come in and now we know why
Use the safety deposit boxes if you go!! Even though they all have a code to be opened by staff if an error occurs and you can't open them

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. I want to extend our sincere apologies for the various inconveniences you experienced, which clearly fell short of the Shangri-La luxury that you were expecting and that we strive to provide.

Regarding the room allocation, I understand your disappointment in not receiving the quiet room you requested. Unfortunately, due to high demand and the unavailability of our Premier Ocean View rooms, we had to allocate you a room near families. I’m truly sorry for the disturbance this caused.

I’m also deeply concerned to hear about your experience with food poisoning after dining in the sports bar. Please know that we take such matters very seriously. An immediate investigation has been initiated by our Hygiene Manager, and preliminary records have been taken and sent for further clarification. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of food safety, and we will keep you informed of the findings.

With regard to the adults-only infinity pool, I apologize that this policy was not adequately enforced during your stay. All colleagues have been reminded to politely inform adults with children to use other pools designated for family use, ensuring that the tranquility of the adults-only pool is maintained.

I’m also sorry to hear about the service lapses you encountered, from the delayed and incorrect room service order to the poor breakfast service. These are certainly not the standards we uphold, and I will address these issues with the relevant departments to prevent such occurrences in the future.

Lastly, I regret that our calls regarding your stay and the timing of luggage assistance felt overbearing, especially the late-night call on your final evening. We will review our procedures to ensure that we provide attentive yet unobtrusive service.

Once again, I apologize for the shortcomings during your stay. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve, and I hope you will give us another opportunity to provide you with the luxury experience you deserve.

The room was dirty with a worm headboard (see picture), which certainly did not make me wish to sit up in bed!!

I asked for a quiet room and was allocated a room between two families, so not quiet at all. 

I ate fish tacos in the sports bar on night one and spent all day in bed on day two with food poisoning thus missing the reason for staying, which was to play golf. 

The staff were hit and miss, some good, others not. My partner ordered room service and had to ask twice where it was as it took so long (45mins plus). When it arrived, the order was incorrect!

There is a lovely adults only infinity pool, unfortunately the 'adults only' bit is not policed and children were often in the pool. 

Breakfast service was poor on the only day I got there. No cups/mugs for hot drinks, which meant tea/coffee arrived 25 minutes after we did. I don't know about you but I prefer to have my coffee with my breakfast, not after it. 

Overbearing at times, the room telephone is not there for you to keep calling and asking how my stay is and I certainly did not appreciate a call at 2100hrs on the final night asking what time I wanted luggage assistance in the morning. 

All of this during low occupancy so I dread to think what it is like when full.","In need of a refresh","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r966472165-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

I would like to extend my deepest apologies for the distressing experience you encountered during your recent stay with us from June 21st to June 23rd, 2024.

We have thoroughly investigated the situation regarding the loss of your husband's wedding ring. Upon receiving your report, our team conducted an exhaustive search of the room and surrounding areas. We also reviewed CCTV footage to identify any suspicious activity. Regrettably, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to locate the ring.

We fully understand the immense sentimental value the ring holds, and we are deeply saddened that we were not able to recover it for you. We acknowledge that our communication during this process was not up to the high standards we strive to maintain, and for that, we are truly sorry.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the frustration and disappointment this has caused. We value you as a guest and are committed to ensuring that such lapses do not occur in the future.

If there is anything further we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Once again, I extend our heartfelt apologies and hope that you will allow us the opportunity to restore your faith in our services in the future.

After checking out, my husband realized he had left his wedding ring in the room. We immediately contacted the hotel's support team via WhatsApp to report the loss and requested that they check the room. Despite multiple follow-ups, the hotel failed to provide any timely or meaningful updates.

What was most frustrating was the complete lack of communication and urgency from the hotel's side. A thorough check of the room should have been conducted within 24 hours of our report, yet it took weeks to receive a vague response that they were unable to locate the ring. This was after we had to repeatedly chase them for updates.

The ring holds immense sentimental value as it was engraved with our wedding date, yet the hotel's after-sales support was shockingly inadequate. Instead of resolving the issue promptly, the hotel allowed it to drag on without proper follow-up or communication, leaving us deeply disappointed.

For a hotel that prides itself on luxury and exceptional service, this experience was far from it. I would not recommend Shangri-La Hambantota to anyone who values prompt and professional customer service.","Disappointing Experience at Shangri-La Hambantota","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r964361735-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

And I had to go back and forth carrying a baby to complete the check in.
We checked in at the Araliya suite to find out that the shower drain wasn't draining the dirty water. After complaining about it they made arrangements to wipe out the shower area without fixing the drain. That's when we finally decided to check out that evening. Upon informing the staff, the management offered us a separate room with free meals as we had booked our room on BB. We decided we didn't want to utilize the free buffet option as an entire day of our vacation was already wasted. And we checked out the next day itself even if we had planned to stay for 2 nights.
The management had decided to waive off our ala carte charges when we check out. 
Additionally we observed that the rooms were not well maintained, wooden frame pieces of the Araliya suite's shower area were falling off and the bathrooms gave out a stong pungent smell.","Not recommended.","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r962861726-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

From the food to the general service, the week-long stay was nothing short of disappointing and frustrating. Most of the staff were kind and hospitable, though suffered from lack of training and understanding of the basics of hotel service. I am a solo traveler, something the staff could not understand or respect through shocked reactions and nervous laughter which was extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant. The hotel was overrun with many loud local families and young children, even in 'adult only' areas i.e. pool. Little to no information was provided at check-in about hotel services. Despite opting for the half-board package, I was initially told the restaurant was full on my first night (catering to 700+ guests for Sri Lankan new year). It was chaos. And things went downhill from there; errors with billing; sub par room service offerings which had food items missing or not matching the menu when served; an extremely basic and repetitive breakfast and dinner buffet (from which I caught food poisoning); staff hanging up the phone when not understanding me; and the list goes on. This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a negative review about a hotel, despite travelling solo across numerous countries. It is also the first time that I tried to cut short a holiday because I was so unhappy with the experience. Credit be due to the F&B Director who tried his best to rectify the situation when acknowledging all that had gone wrong. However, it was too little too late. My first visit to Sri Lanka was completely tainted by this badly, badly managed hotel which should absolutely not be labelled as a 5* luxury hotel.

However, from the moment we arrived, it was nothing but disappointment.

We reached the hotel around 2:30 PM, understanding that the standard check-in time was 3:00 PM. However, despite waiting in the lobby until then, the receptionist informed us that our room would take an additional 15 minutes. Instead of allowing us to wait in a comfortable space, we were sent to the pool area, which was unbearably hot and lacked proper seating—especially challenging when traveling with kids. Frustrated, we returned to the lobby, only to continue waiting until 3:50 PM for our room to be ready.

Upon finally entering the room at 4:00 PM, our disappointment only grew. The so-called suite was far smaller than expected. Based on the hotel’s website, a suite should be around 49m², but this particular ground-floor room clearly didn’t match those specifications. While that was partially our oversight for not checking photos in detail beforehand, the real issues began once we entered.

The room was extremely hot, and even after switching on the AC, there was no cooling effect after 30 minutes. We called for a technician at 5:30 PM, and by that time, I personally spoke to the front desk manager, who assured us of a room change and promised compensation in the form of full board and late checkout. However, even by 8:00 PM, the AC was still not functioning properly. Thankfully, the outside temperature cooled down at night, but by morning, the room became unbearably warm again. At that point, we didn’t even bother calling maintenance, as having a technician come in and out of such a small, congested space—especially with kids—would have only added to the inconvenience.

Having stayed at numerous Sri Lankan hotel chains, traveling almost every month, this was by far the worst experience we’ve had. To make matters worse, when we inquired about the full board compensation the next day, another manager dismissed it, saying we were only eligible for a late checkout.

This hotel’s service is highly unprofessional, and the way families are treated is unacceptable. I strongly advise anyone considering a stay here—especially families—to thoroughly check the hotel photos and reviews before booking. We expected a premium experience from Sheraton, but what we received was a complete disaster.","A Highly Disappointing Experience – Not Recommended for Families","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r995068479-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Новый год решили провести в новом месте, выбрали Шри Ланку. Да, мы привыкли к сервису и готовы за него всегда платить.
Все приключение началось с заселения в номер. Мы взяли номер с собственным бассейном. При заселении обнаружили пустой мини бар. Он реально был пустой, 5 звезд отель) При просьбе его заполнить-нам сказали что его придется оплачивать(что само собой разумеется и мы это понимаем). Но смех, нам пополнили через часа
три минибар)

Что касается обслуживания. Скорее всего на
Шри-Ланке его нет или не дотягивает до уровня, хотя сеть марриот славится своим
обслуживанием.
-постоянно нужно вылавливать официантов,
выпрашивать себе напитки или что-то подобное!
В первый день, попросили в обед принести виски и колу) Пол часа ждали, пять раз просили, на шестой раз истерика уже началась))) говорим, в чем проблема принести? Мы заплатим)))) ответ - а у нас колы нет, есть только пепси и после уже конфликта нам родили после шестой просьбы
пепси и виски))))
-несут бутылку открытого пива минут 10, при
пустом баре, про какие-то коктейли можно
промолчать, там по пол часа ждать надо
- В ОДИН ИЗ дней пребывания нам вообще сказали:
Пепси кончалось, и северап! Но при этом на следующий день пепси появился на столе у местных гостей ) только когда спросили почему у них есть, а для нас нет, нам принесли пепси) ПЯТЬ ЗВЕЗД ОТЕЛЬ! 
- вся еда с перцем, если вы не готовы есть
Сутра до вечера условные острые крылышки kfc )))) то вам не сюда
Это было мучение найти блюдо без перца, конечно мы не рассчитывали на турецкий олин но такого нигде не видели, на третий день просто аппетита даже ходить в ресторан не было. Все под местный контингент, вся кухня индийская. 

Мы прилетели с ребенком. Найти что-то поесть для Ребенка- мучение, все же острое невероятно. Детского меню нет вообще

Пляж это отдельная тема. Напоминает дальние времена черноморского побережья. Осталость еще что бы Раков с рыбой продавали)  Приставучие люди, с просьбой чтото купить.
Черепах вообще сначала сказали посмотреть за 1000 руб с человека, но потом за троих взяли всего лишь 8 долларов. 

постельное белье чистое. Но...допустим ушные палочки, ватные диски-приходится
Выпрашивать. На 3 людей 2 больших полотенца. А на третий день нам оставили только одно полотенце вообще на троих. Выпрашивали пол дня второе. Душевая кабина ок, чистая. Сама ванна течет струей) Это стандарт 5 звезд? Когда ты платишь, не очень маленькие деньги-ты ждешь какого-то сервиса и выбираешь Шератон.

Но как оказалось его тут нет, элементарного.
Даже дав на чай официанту, или кому-то из
персонала, тебя забывают через 5-10 минут)

А Новый год ? Мы же за ним прилетели.
Бронировали накануне стол определенный, когда на деле пришли на ужин, нам дали стол где-то на задворках, мы стали говорить, что бронировали стол абсолютно в другом месте, нам экстренно его перенесли рядом с тем местом где должен был стоять наш стол, а за реально нашим столом посадили других людей. И вот так во всем!

Сервис это не сюда, для знающих людей и
видевших много стран, не стоит, лучше за эти же деньги (за тот же номер -600к за 4 дня) полететь на мальдивы, где все будет топ!!!!","Худший сервис , не понимаю отзывы на пять звезд, либо люди не знают какой должен быть сервис в 5 звезд отелях","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r987355788-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

My son sustained an injury during our stay, which required medical attention. After we arrived in Colombo, we had to consult another doctor for further treatment. It was a stressful and upsetting experience for our family.

What disappointed us the most was the lack of follow-up from the hotel management after we checked out. Despite the seriousness of the situation, no one reached out to inquire about my son's condition or offer any support. This level of indifference was deeply disheartening and not what we expected from a reputed establishment.

Furthermore, it seems this incident could have been prevented if the pool and surrounding areas were regularly inspected for potential hazards. This raises serious concerns about the hotel’s safety measures and commitment to guest well-being.

While my son is now recovering, the lack of accountability and empathy from the hotel has left us feeling incredibly disappointed. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and prioritizes guest safety and care in the future.","Safety Concerns and Lack of Care from Management","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r987040399-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback following your recent visit to Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort. 
Your detailed feedback provides valuable insights into various aspects of your stay. It's evident that several areas, such as the Check-In experience, Spa experience, and your request for the dental kit, did not meet your expectations. Your observations highlight important areas for improvement, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by these shortcomings.
We are truly sorry for the delays you encountered during check-in and with the delivery of your luggage. These lapses in efficiency are unacceptable, and I have addressed them with our Front Office team to ensure such oversights are not repeated.
Additionally, we apologize for the inconvenience caused by the unmanned spa desk and the failure to deliver your requested dental kit. This falls short of the high standards we aim to maintain. I have shared your feedback with the relevant teams, and we are taking steps to enhance our internal communication and responsiveness to guest needs.
We value your concerns and are committed to making necessary improvements. I understand your concerns and hope you appreciate the measures taken to restore your faith in our services. 
Thank you again for bringing these issues to our attention. We hope you will enjoy the remainder of your stay with us.

Unfortunately, the buffet was a huge disappointment from start to finish.
Starting with the soup—it was completely tasteless, lacking any depth or flavor. Moving on to the salad corner, there were barely any options available. The only decent item was the corn salad. The fish salad was another letdown; the fish pieces were so dry and unappealing, they looked and tasted far from fresh.
For the main course, the only rice option available was plain rice. Not even fried rice or anything remotely interesting to choose from. Only spaghetti was found tasty at main dish. The chicken was also disappointing—only a few boiled pieces, and when they were finished, we had to wait a frustrating 15-20 minutes for a refill. This delay in service for such basic dishes was unacceptable, especially for a large group.
The dessert corner was slightly better compared to the rest of the buffet, but even then, some items were not tasty at all. The sago pudding, caramel, and watalappan were especially bad, lacking any real flavor.
Overall, the buffet was severely lacking in variety, quality, and service. For a five-star hotel, we expected much more in terms of options and taste. This lunch buffet was definitely not worth the price, and our entire group left feeling disappointed. Would not recommend for a large group or anyone expecting a true five-star experience.","Disappointing Sheraton Buffet Experience","2024-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r969273864-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for the review and for having stayed with us. We are aware of the concerns you raised and had provided you with rational explanations. While we do not see the situation that arose upon your arrival as a confrontation, it is important for us to highlight that the hotel has a specific entrance and a process associated with an arrival that ensures the necessary security checks in the best interest of our guests and associates alike. 

Furthermore, we have also explained this to you during my meeting with you, and also informed that we will offer the suite upgrade. We wish to state that our property is sought after by many guests and the swimming pool in particular is a highlight, given that it is one of the largest along the south coast. We experienced a power failure at noon time and trust you would appreciate your departure time was extended till 16.00HRS as previously agreed. In honoring the privacy requirement of the team, we do not encourage the creation of separate social media chat groups without the consent of the associate concerned, and this was the reason for my exit from that group.

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, no shops, no restaurants around. It’s indeed not a real resort as there is just a small swimming pool as facility. Beach is close, but there will be no beach chairs/towels offered by the hotel. The beach is not under the hotels’ supervision. There are many outside local vendors beyond, who try hard to sell you their water sports, massages, etc.
Not just I didn’t receive a warm welcome from the hotel as other hotel, there was an serious (arrogance) issue on general staffs attitude. There was an incident to me that staffs were unfriendly showing me the direction to checkin, even I asked for. No recognition of elite members were received. You have to use your SNA if you want to have a possible upgrade. The worst thing was 99% of the time at the stay would be no wifi working in your room. The GM (Mr. Xxxx, who I was able to WhatsApp, cut his conversation off from my message without any reason. It was kinda odd and impolite to do so. The GM, who took over the position 5 months ago, put himself away from his duty as he didn’t try to do anything during the confrontation with me. I suppose he will send me a message like, “I am sorry for what happened, and hope to have improvement during your next stay”.
The age of hotel was not old but the maintenance was terrible! Stains could be seen on the sofa, water was dripping at toilet hose.) I have no comments on food as I was not feeling a good hospitality from most of the staffs. Electricity was totally cut at 12pm as its like the hotel tried to kick me out despite the 4pm late checkout was confirmed. Chat room with Bonvoy App was cut too! That moments were like in prison!

Шведский стол. Очень изобильный. Есть и морепродукты , и местная кухня. Очень вкусно. 
Также хочется отметить традиционное для сети Марриот качество постели. Спалось на нем прекрасно. 
Пляж в этом месте отличный. Можно спокойно купаться - волны не такие сильные. Всё очень живописно , если пройти налево и направо. 
Теперь о недостатках. К сожалению, их больше. Персонал очень не вежлив, чувствовалось, что тебе здесь не рады, делают одолжение. Наигранные улыбки. В день выезда чуть позже 12 на несколько минут персонал стал стучаться в дверь и требовать освободить номер. Разве это достойно такой сети отелей ? 
Когда попытался расплатиться на ресепшн картой Юнион Пэй, персонал сказал, что терминал для российских карт не работает. Хотя, в других местах и отелях на Шри-Ланке всё работало без проблем и удавалось оплатить везде. Такое поведение я объясняю неклиенториентированностью, что опять же, очень странно для отеля такой сети, как Марриот и для сервиса. 
Также я хочу отметить, что в этом отеле не оказалось ортопедических подушек или любых других подушек - при попытке узнать про эту возможность, мне грубо ответили , что других подушек нет и всё. В общем, за персонал, сервис и его отношение - жирный минус и плохая оценка","Из плюсов - отличный завтрак и пляж","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r942741091-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback following your recent visit to Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort. 

At the onset, we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations. The reservations were made two days before your arrival, and the travel agent cancelled the booking as you didn't arrive as per the initial booking. When you visited the property, we had to liaise with the travel agent and make a fresh booking to accommodate you. This caused the delay as there was communication between the hotel reservation and the travel agent. However, our team did their utmost best to allocate the rooms as early as possible.
 
Regarding the reception air conditioning, I would like to educate you about the architectural aspect of the resort. We are a beachfront property, and taking advantage of the same, the lobby is designed so that the breeze will flow across the reception to the lobby entrance. However, as Sri Lanka is a tropical country, there could be days when the humidity is above average. During such days, we accommodate our guests in our Sho lounge, allowing them to enjoy snacks and beverages until the rooms get ready. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you upon your arrival. 

As clarified before, the travel agent cancelled your initial reservation; hence, we have sold those king-bed rooms, and upon arrival, the availability was only for twin rooms. As you requested, the rooms should be upper floor rooms too, so we were compelled to offer those twin rooms. I hope you will understand that the hotel is operating at its peak during December. 

The rooms are cleaned daily as per a schedule, and in the meantime, towels will be changed upon request, and the amenities will be replenished as well. However, if the rooms are in a Do Not Disturb state, the service will not be provided respecting the guest's privacy. 
We have multiple outlets for our guests to enjoy any alcohol/ non-alcohol beverages. It is a practice that we do not allow the guests to bring their alcohol into the public venues of the property. 

Kindly note that the beach is public, and the vendors selling sun loungers outside the hotel fence are beyond our control. Plenty of sun loungers are available on our pool lawn for sunbathing, which many guests enjoy throughout their stay. 

As a responsible hospitality service provider, it is our duty to look after all our guests and to ensure that they have a pleasant stay with us. Our team offered service recovery for the mishaps that occurred due to the reservation cancellation. However, we take your feedback very seriously and address it with all departments concerned to ensure we mitigate the shortcomings as we progress. 

Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience caused. We sincerely hope this experience will not deter you from visiting us in the future. 

Sincerely, 
Mano Gunasekera
General Manager

2)По приезду в Шератон админы  с респешна продержали нас 4 часа в жаре т.к. в ресепшн нет кондиционеров, ссылаясь на то что тур компания не подтверждает наш заезд и всякие разные причины вплоть до того что ""мадам"" с ресепшена заявила что мы вообще безденежные что бы о чем то спорить с ними. Не могу сказать что у нас такой маленький багаж знаний по отелям, но даже в каком то guest house других стран админы не вели себя на столько мерзко, сколько позволили себе в достаточно известной сетке отелей всего мира. Были в культурном шоке от встречи.                                                                                          
3)Далее были бронированы номера с 1 большой кроватью ""кинг сайз"", хочу еще раз напомнить у нас идет ранее бронирование, чего в нашем случае, а нас 14 человек парами, спали как брат и сестра на разных кроватях.                                                                      4) Номера убирают по желанию персонала, когда захотели и что в номере посчитали нужным убрать. Не доставляют мыло мойку, полотенца не меняют, на 4 день пребывания пришлось обращаться в ресепшн, и это обращение было исполнено всего лишь 1 раз. Что не соответствует уровня 5 звездочного отеля.                                                                                                                                            5) у бассейна со своими напитками запрещено находиться, надо платить. Были удивлены такому сервису.                                                                                             
6) на пляже за шезлонги и зонты отдельно оплачиваешь. Хотя первые 3 дня мы были в Мариоте (одна и та же сетка отелей) там на пляже охранники подбегали забирали окурки и жестяные банки от пива что бы бросить их в урну не то что платить за шезлонги.                                                                                                     
7) персонал на ресепшене злопамятный! после такой встречи пару админов  отворачивались видя нас делая вид что нас нет. благо там 3 стойки.                                                 
Вот это все что касаемо данного отеля. По еде в принципе относительно нормально, персонал в ресторане дружелюбный, без проблем можно было сделать доставку до номера.                                                                                            и небольшой PS при выходе с отеля мы познакомились и подружились с замечательным гидом Сарат Watsapp +94770805223 организованные им экскурсии обошлись нам почти в два раза дешевле, чем предлагал туроператор от фирмы. Человек он очень приятный, не навязывает ничего, чуть владеет русским. Если надо куда то съездить он откликается сразу. Обращайтесь.              
 И далее обращение непосредственно к Вам Мистер Mano Gunasekera, General Manager, Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort: Вы отвечаете только на положительные отзывы?! От Вас лично нам 20 отдыхавшим у вас в отеле гостей извинения не нужны!!! Примите к сведению, что ваш персонал и Вы лично как старший менеджер не справляетесь со своими прямыми обязанностями, у вашего персонала нет элементарной этики по отношению к вашим гостям!

Если не хотите испортить себе отдых и сэкономить деньги не берите данный отель , есть с чем сравнивать на Шри-Ланке не в первой.. 
по порядку : 
Из плюсов встретили с барабанами + прохладительный напиток, пляж .. и все 

Минусы: 
Все включено - это нечего - точнее вообще нечего все строго в выделенное время только по расписанию с 6-30 до 10-30 завтрак, с 12-30 до15 обед, 19 до 22-30 ужин.. в баре все по расписанию - с 11-23 только лимонады, пиво, вино
Есть еще бар в нем с 19-23 так же лимонады, пиво , вино .. так же предлагают с 16-17 перекусы из сэндвичей и чай-кофе 

Все .. захотел перекусить в другое время плати - вся еда и напитки платная - и цены приличные так - хочешь быть сытым ешь в обед до отвала что бы с с 15-17 не помереть с голоду 

По еде нет нечего такого что б прям вау, довольно примитивное все.
Мини бара - нету - только за оплату если попросить за деньги покупай у них же в баре наполнят ..

Номера убиты - щеток нет, везите с собой. Из того что положили шампуни и гели остальных принадлежностей как принято в all inclusive нету .. все с собой 

Шезлонги на пляже платные 1$ час аренды 

В общем не стоит своих денег

At the onset, we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations. We have noted your concerns about the guest room's maintenance and upkeep.

We have placed a card in all guest bathrooms, educating the guests about changing bathroom linen procedures.

Thank you for sharing your experience following your recent visit to Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort.

At the onset, we apologize for the inconvenience caused during your stay with us. 

The room allocations are done based on the room category that you have selected. During your previous stay, you enjoyed a different category, and the same room was occupied during your stay. Hence, upon your request, our team respectfully denied your request. We have noted your concern about the availability of seafood dishes. The seafood options are primarily available on our a la carte menus and offered both at the Main and Olive restaurants. The layout of the buffet varies in different seasons and purely depends on the nationality mix of the hotel as we cater to a multi-national portfolio of guests during the peak season. We have set times for the restaurant operations, and we are more than happy to cater to our guests even if they are late for their meals. This will not differ from serving our guests the quality of cuisine that we offer at all times. 

Sri Lanka is a tropical country and experiences monsoon rains during specific periods of the year. Unlike other years, November was a month when we experienced a high rainfall, which caused the dampness. Also, the monsoon rain causes an increase in the breeding of mosquitos. However, our utmost priority is to protect our guests and associates. Keeping this in mind, we do fogging thrice a week to ensure the environment is safe for our guests to enjoy their holiday. 

It is our sincere desire to exceed the expectations of all our guests, and it saddens us to know that we have not been able to achieve it this time. Your feedback is well received, as it is essential to us in the process of continuous improvement in our product and services towards our guests.

We hope this experience will not deter you from visiting us in the future. 

At your service, we remain.

Общее впечатление об отеле : это тройка … для Sheratona это самый худший отель … Поверьте , мы много путешествуем , и нам есть с чем сравнивать ..","Отдых в отеле февраль 2023 и ноябрь 2023 года","2023-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r928459659-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Слышимость в номере колоссальная - слышно каждое слово соседей, детей играющих в холле.

Низкое качество алкоголя. Про то что входит в типо “все включено» вообще молчу, там то только шриланкийские напитки низкого качества, про то что можно заказать по меню - игристое с оценками в Vivino 3,3, просекко нет и Дон переньон за 500 €. Странно для отеля сети Marriott иметь такую плохую винную карту.
Магазинов поблизости где можно было бы купить хотя бы просекко - нет. 
И нет напитков без сахара.
Если вы не пьёте пепси и дешевый алкоголь - не берите all inclusive. 

По еде - мы ехали за тунцом, лососем и устрицами. Ничего подобного нет даже в меню alacarte. Только креветки, крабы и местные виды белых рыб.

По морю - Всегда большие волны, спокойного моря не было. 
Пляж не принадлежит отелю, территория отеля огорожена сеткой, за ограждением много местных «гидов» пытающихся впарить разные экскурсии. Ты лежишь у бассейна, а они собрались человек 5-10 и ждут когда ты выйдешь и подходят очень навязчиво.

Но самое ужасное - это слышимость в номерах, мы не высыпаемся. Это не про комфортный отдых, который ожидаешь от отеля сети Marriot.
И очень много Комаров!","Не рекомендую, никакой шумоизоляции, не комфортно, плохой алкоголь.","2023-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r922883537-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Если вы были в Турции или Египте на «все включено» - сюда ехать не стоит) самый большой минус - еда. 90% мяса - острое. Раз в три дня дают говядину, так в основном только курица в карри, либо какая-то рыба типа минтая. Морепродуктов не увидите, раз в 2-3 дня могут быть кальмары и огрызки малюсеньких недоочищенных креветок. Если написано «паста с морепродуктами» - там будут макароны в соусе и 1% рыбы. Фруктов толком не было, наполовину зеленые арбузы и бананы, можешь быть папайя. Миллион видов острого риса, один вид картошки каждый день, пустые макароны (якобы паста). На завтрак всегда одно и то же - хлопья с молоком, омлет/яичница, булки. Хорошо, что дети в этот раз остались с бабушкой, им было бы просто нечего есть. 2 раза была пицца простенькая, которую тут же сметали. Захотите поменять отель - не сможете, будут уговаривать остаться, «наши гости всегда счастливы». Мы говорили с другими гостями, они не счастливы, не обольщайтесь) отдельно стоит упомянуть, что в промежуток с 16.30 до 17.30 обещают закуски для все включено)))) их либо нет, либо стоит одна тарелка каких-то овощей и тарелка с кексами на ВЕСЬ отель, это смешно) в первый наш день еще и стоял сотрудник смотрел, чтобы много не накладывали себе😂 потом мы пожаловались, вроде, убрали его. Мы с мужем алкоголь не пьем, брали колу, фанту или спрайт в баре, из автомата там все разбавлено водой. Один раз выцепили вкусный напиток с маракуйей, на следующий день нам уже сказали, что это «welcomе» напиток не для «все включено»😄 все включено - это все включено, владельцы и администрация отеля, это обращение к вам) 

Из хорошего - неплохие номера, но сначала нам дали с раздельными односпальными кроватями номер (видя, что пара муж и жена), пришлось просить менять. Пол в номере красит ноги) убирались нормально, туалетную бумагу почему-то не давали😄полки не протирали в ванной точно, там у нас как умер муравей в первый день, так и лежал.  Приходят убираться в основном в самую жару, когда все прячутся от солнца, видимо, чтоб им говорили, что уборка не нужна) море хорошее, но бывают сильные волны, муж цепочку потерял. Лежаков хватает далеко не всегда, маленький пляж. Зато наливают газировку из бутылок) рядом с отелем есть пара ресторанчиков, можно поесть, мне понравилось в принципе, брала креветки, муж свинину, сказал невкусно. В «О2» угостили еще какой-то рыбой и мороженым) до Маравилы 40 минут пешком, но там особо ничего нет. На все экскурсии очень долго ехать, имейте ввиду! Анимации никакой нет, орущая музыка под ухом на ужинах. Бассейн хороший, но там плещутся вороны, можно подхватить что-нибудь 99%. Два дня в 6 утра косили газон прям у домиков с номерами, кошмар. 
Есть бильярд, большой и настольный теннис, можно взять велосипеды покататься, это плюс. Но большинство помещений и инвентарь убитые, требуют немедленной замены. 

В ноябре шли дожди почти каждый вечер, один день дождь был с обеда до самой ночи. А так всегда +29/+31. Народ улыбчивый, все стараются помочь, если обратиться с вопросом.","В общем, если вы хотите потратить деньги с умом, сюда ехать не стоит) отель чисто переночевать, на 4* не тянет.","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r980934151-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

Einige blieben direkt am Buffet und bedienten ohne ein Löffel. 200 Tiere die noch nie essen gesehen haben. Andere Gäste hatten nur Schock. Wir ekelten uns weiter zu essen und der gebuchte relax Tag hat nicht mal angefangen. Wir sowie andere Gäste beschwerten sich an die zuständigen Hotel Personal. Sie sagten nur das sie auch Nix machen könne. Die hatten wohl für eine Woche das Hotel gebucht.  Ohne vernünftiges Mittagessen gingen wir weiter zum Pool wo uns versichert wurde das diese 200 Büffel erst 18 Uhr ins Pool kommen. Keine 30 Minuten später stiegen sie ohne entsprechende Bekleidung mit Shirt und Jeans oder was auch immer die anhaben ins Pool. Es war so ekelig. Wir waren öfters andere Hotels aber das haben noch nie erlebt.  Alle raus aus Pool und unsere Kinder direkt mit. Unsere Tagesausflug war in 2 stunden zu Ende mit ein Schock. Bei Hotel Manger beschwert aber er meinte auch das er Nix machen kann. Wir würden schöne Kekse bekommen für Abends Tee als  Entschädigung. Es war nur peinlich und lachhaft. Keine richtige Anlaufstelle für Beschwerden. Wir wurden mit Lächeln und Kopfnicken getröstet ohne eine vernünftige Lösung. Geld futsch Tag im Eimer.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka, from June 11 to June 16, 2025. While I had high expectations based on the hotel's reputation, my experience fell short in several key areas.

Check-In Experience: Upon arrival, the check-in process was relatively smooth; however, I was disappointed to find that the hotel could not accommodate the specific room I had originally opted for. This was my first indication that my stay might not meet my expectations.

Laundry Service Discrepancy: The most significant issue arose during my checkout. I had received a confirmed email outlining the room tariff, which included 4 pieces of laundry per day. Given my 5-night stay, I was entitled to a total of 20 pieces of laundry. Unfortunately, I did not utilize the laundry service during the first three days of my stay. However, on the 4th and 5th days, I submitted 13 pieces and 7 pieces of laundry, respectively.

At checkout, the billing staff initially requested payment for all 20 pieces of laundry. Subsequently, I was informed that I was only eligible for 8 pieces, as the hotel staff claimed that my lack of usage during the first three days limited my entitlement. Despite my attempts to clarify the situation and present the confirmed inclusion in my tariff, the staff remained unyielding and dismissive. As a result, I was compelled to pay for 12 pieces of laundry, amounting to LKR 5139.00, in addition to an extra USD 45 for the inclusion of the laundry service.

Staff Conduct: I must also address the demeanor of the front office staff during this encounter. Their attitude was not only unwelcoming but also hostile, which exacerbated an already frustrating situation. This lack of professionalism is concerning, especially for a hotel of your standing, and it detracts from the overall guest experience.

Conclusion: While Kingsbury Hotel is well-regarded among both local and international guests, my experience has raised concerns about the rigidity of staff policies and the overall guest service. I believe that addressing these issues is crucial not only for the hotel's reputation but also for the positive image of Sri Lanka as a travel destination.

I hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration to improve future guest experiences. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Kaustav Das","Feedback on My Recent Stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka","2025-06","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1013414555-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

First of all, when we came by our car, there was no doorman to open the hotel doors or even the back doors of the car. I went there in the third week of March for my best friend's birthday. We were 4 friends in total, and it was our treat for the birthday boy. To my surprise, there was no staff to ask about where Harbour Court was, since it was our first time visiting The Kingsbury. Our first choice was our usual hotel which is a luxury 5-star hotel in Colombo; I prefer not to say their name on here and it is a top ranked hotel on this platform. Yet there were no proper staff or the ones available were very busy with foreign guests. I think they have no interest in serving local Sri Lankan people, where we felt very discriminated against. After asking a person seated on the lobby chairs, who I think was a guest too, we finally found out. We went to Harbour Court. Again, they disappointed me. I made a reservation around 2 pm by calling the hotel for the dinner buffet and asked to reserve a table with a view, that means a 4-pax table near the big glass window. They told me they would surely reserve the relevant table near the window. But the girl at the restaurant reception reserved a table far away from the window and very near to the buffet, where people were busy picking food. It made us very stressed because it was crowded, and we couldn’t even have a little private conversation because people in the food queue could hear us.
OK, that is bearable, we can forgive it. But I was very amazed to see that in this kind of luxury fine dining, there are no waiters. For the whole crowded restaurant, I could find only 3 or 4 managers wearing coats who had no interest in serving guest's requirements, they were just talking and laughing with each other. I saw only one waiter in a waiter suit. We wanted cool water for our glasses after coming to the table with the food. We wanted to say this to a waiter, but there was only one waiter, and I saw maybe three people with ties and white shirts serving others, but they were busy serving the other half of the restaurant. We were wondering, where are these people who are working? These are not fake stories, and I too couldn't believe that we had to face these awful things in this kind of a luxury hotel.

Then, finally, after a few minutes of looking for anyone, a manager came. I can’t remember his name, but he was a bit bald-headed. After asking, he went to bring cold water. Then again, they failed to meet our requirement. They brought OLU water instead of normal filtered water with ice. I think the bottle costs 400 rupees, but with tax and everything, it should be around 600, I guess. The manager brought three OLU water bottles instead of what we asked; normal filtered water with ice. Is there any intention to cost guests more by making profits cunningly? We had to use these OLU bottles because if we reject them, we would have waited another half an hour looking for a waiter to bring us water. I want to mention that one of the managers came and offered us the drinks menu. One of my friends politely said we’ll order later in the eating session because we wanted to. Shockingly, this guy came again and again, insisting that we order some cocktails by being a big headache. He kept recommending different kinds of drinks, disturbing our conversations. Since it was my friend's birthday, I went to the reception girl and requested to sing happy birthday to my friend. I want to mention that on the occasion, there were other people having birthdays and two girls and one boy were singing happy birthday to them. It was unusual they were busy doing that. Somehow, even after two requests, they forgot to wish my friend. It would have made his day!!! After two requests, I stopped asking them to sing and I dropped that idea, thinking never ever coming to this hotel again, and I will not recommend it to anyone. 

I want to strictly ask that, don't you guys care about your guests??? The reason I say that is because including myself, we are big fans of egg hoppers. The action station was queued with a lot of people willing to get hoppers. I think they should put two or more chefs to do that.

After all these things, the main part of the buffet is food, right? I thought we would forget all these shocking disappointments after eating good soothing food with some mouth-watering seafood. But I don���t know the reason, shockingly, we were so unfortunate because the food was extremely disappointing. Steamed rice and biriyani were the only rice options. Not even fried rice was there. Is Kingsbury an Indian hotel like Taj Samudra??? Because 60% of the food was Indian food! The beef was very chewy and not even slightly tender, resulting in me giving back my plate with that low quality beef. My friends strongly recommended that Kingsbury dinner buffet has more seafood varieties than other hotels, but being a seafood lover, I could barely find any seafood. I was wondering where this so-called legacy of Kingsbury has gone. So disappointing! The only seafood was some butter-fried pieces. Thinking something is better than nothing, I ate them. Again, as usual, it was disappointing. They had a very thin small fillet of fish under a big butter-fried layer. 
To be more specific, there was only chewy low-quality cuttlefish and fish with big layers of butter and oil. I mean, what is this guys? How can you make people feel mislead and take huge amounts of money for these low-quality food collections while claiming a very high standard five-star hotel? Then we came to the dessert section. Being a big ice-cream lover, I straightly went to the ice-cream kottu action station. To my huge disappointment, the guy in the dessert section said very rudely, ""There's no ice cream kottu, and we can't provide it since the board of the ice cream kottu maker is broken and not freezing to be eligible to make ice cream kottu."" Guys, this reflects a lack of attention to basic hospitality standards.  Can’t you guys try to repair it as soon as possible and provide the specific dessert again? Instead of being rude to guests. Then I tried to get normal ice cream, but the same rude guy serving ice cream was pouring scoops as little as laddus. Only two little scoops. It was disappointing to see such limited portions being served, especially for a high end buffet. Then the small chocolate pieces were finished, and only dark chocolate and mint chocolate was left, and they were not restocking for people. It’s very sad to see two tables away from us getting a birthday singing with a small cake but not us.

So, thank you very much Kingsbury for showing your true colors!! I am not coming to Kingsbury again and will not recommend it to others. These positive reviews about this Kingsbury are also very false because after paying the bill this manager guy came and asked from the four of us to write a good review with 5 stars mentioning his name. I felt very sad about these guys begging for good reviews on this platform. Finally, to whoever reading this, I wanna say I strongly advise others to reconsider before visiting Kingsbury!","A Huge Dissapointment about this Kingsbury","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1013056155-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The beef biriyani rice was not only dry but also excessively spicy, the beef was undercooked with an overwhelming amount of sodium, and the chicken's taste was also subpar. 

While the other items included in the sawan were of average quality, the biriyani's poor execution significantly impacted the overall experience.

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We deeply regret that your experience at Honey Beach Club did not meet the high standards you and your friends expected, especially on such a special occasion. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the discomfort and inconvenience you encountered throughout your visit.

It is concerning to hear about the lack of professionalism and service from our staff, especially in regards to the initial greeting, the handling of your cake, and the rain-related issues. This does not reflect the level of service we strive to provide at our establishment. The lack of proper communication and management during the rain, as well as the issue with the drinks, are areas we will address immediately to ensure this does not happen again in the future.

We truly appreciate your positive mention of the staff member who helped with your clothes. Rest assured, we will take your feedback seriously and review our procedures to improve service consistency, especially during unforeseen circumstances like weather changes.

Yesterday, we came for my best friend’s bride to be party just six of us. We made a reservation at Honey Beach Club for six people. When we made the reservation, we clearly asked what would happen if it rained. They assured us that if it rained, they would arrange seating in an indoor area.

From the beginning, it was a terrible experience. When I arrived, I went to the restroom with my friend, and there were three ladies in black uniforms. They were shouting without any discipline and rudely asked me to move. It was very uncomfortable. Is that what hospitality looks like in a star-class hotel? We felt like we were in a street restaurant.

After that, we returned to our table. When my other friends arrived with a cake, no one provided a knife or a side plate until we asked for it. We did not expect such poor service from a hotel of this standard.

Then, it started to rain, and we wanted to place an order, but no staff members were available. We waited, and as the rain got heavier, no one took responsibility for the guests. Eventually, we moved inside, and at least the F&B staff acknowledged us, but where were the managers? I saw one person in a full suit, but he didn’t even smile at the guests.

To make matters worse, all our drinks got caught in the rain, and instead of replacing them immediately, they brought the drinks  now mixed with rainwater back to our table. Can anyone drink that? We had to ask for new drinks, and only then did they provide them.

However, I want to appreciate one lady who helped us dry our clothes .her service was commendable.

I’m also a hotelier, which is why we chose this venue for such a special occasion, but it turned out to be the worst experience we’ve had at a star-class hotel. There were so many staff members in full suits perhaps managers but what’s the point of having them if they don’t lead their team or step in when guests are facing issues?

Why should we spend our money on this kind of service ?","Worst experience.","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r996507216-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Over the years, I have always admired the impeccable service and professionalism of the hotel staff, particularly the concierge team. Unfortunately, my recent experience has left me very disappointed.
Ahead of my trip to Sri Lanka, I emailed the concierge team on December 15th, 2024, requesting assistance with booking five first-class train tickets for my journey from Colombo to Ella on December 27th and for the return trip on December 30th. I also highlighted how their support in the past had been excellent. However, to my surprise, I did not receive any response neither a confirmation nor an explanation if they were unable to assist. I trusted that I would receive a confirmation or at least a reply in time, and because of that, I missed my planned trip to Ella entirely. I had to settle for traveling only to the southern region of the country instead, which was very disappointing as I had looked forward to this experience for a long time.
As a frequent visitor to this hotel every two years, I expected better communication, especially since the concierge team has previously been very reliable, even during peak seasons. If they were unable to arrange the booking, a simple response acknowledging my request would have been appreciated. I am deeply disappointed with the lack of communication this time, and I hope the management takes this feedback seriously.

We ordered 3 (1.5 kg each) herb and garlic roasted chicken with veggies but the portion of veggies was not worth the money. The chicken was bland and lacked flavour.

Recycled Food in Buffet: The dinner buffet had the same items as the next day’s breakfast and dinner. It felt like leftover food was being reused across multiple meals, which is completely unacceptable.
Uncleaned Mugs and Cups: The mugs and cups in the rooms were dirty and not properly cleaned, raising hygiene concerns.
Dirty Pillows and Towels: Pillows and towels had stains, and even the replacements provided were visibly dirty, with patches and marks.
Rusty and Smelly Bathroom: The bathroom was in terrible condition—rusty fixtures, dirty surfaces, and a strong unpleasant odor. It was impossible to use the bathroom comfortably.
Unsealed Water Bottles: The water bottles provided were unsealed, looking like they were refilled, which is highly concerning from a hygiene perspective.
Non-Functional Locker: The in-room locker was rusty and didn’t work at all, making it completely useless.
AC Turned Off: The air conditioning was inexplicably turned off on the second day at the buffet area leaving the room uncomfortably warm.
Poor Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi was only functional inside the room and did not work anywhere else in the hotel, which was highly inconvenient.
TV Remote Not Working: The TV remote didn’t work, which added to the frustration during our stay.
Unfair Extra Charges: We were charged extra for room service when we simply asked for replacements for the dirty towels and cups. This was not something we ordered, but a basic necessity due to their negligence.
No Toothbrush or Toothpaste: We were surprised to learn that the hotel doesn't provide basic essentials like toothbrush and toothpaste. When we asked, they told us they generally don't provide them. This is highly unusual as most other hotels provide these essentials as a standard service.
Despite paying Rs150,000+, the experience was far below what should be expected from any hotel. The lack of cleanliness, subpar food hygiene, and additional, unfair charges left us deeply disappointed.

We thank you for taking your time on posting a review on TripAdvisor about Bansei resort. We have warmly welcome you all and gave all the hotel instructions with room facilities. as a practice Housekeeping department released the rooms once they checked all the room amenities are in order only.
We have clearly informed upon check in time that room amenities can use within the hotel promises and not allow to bring out of the hotel. therefore at check out time for missing sanitizer bottle we had to apply additional cost accordingly.

And regarding breakfast normally we serve between 07.30 Hrs to 09.30 Hrs at the Main restaurant. As you had with five adults group we had to arranged one table for you all for the breakfast. Anyhow you all came as one couple firstly, then other three one by one. Therefore it takes little bit time to serve the breakfast as it was course by course  personalize service meal however it didn't take that much time as you mentioned  and Kindly requesting you If any issues like above you may inform us during the time of service then only we can re-correct the issues and make your holiday memorable one. 

At the checked out time I was told by you that it has taken nearly one hour to serve the breakfast. But in your TripAdvisor comment you have mentioned two hours. Coral rock hotel we greatly value guest feedback.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and giving us the opportunity to serve you.

The hotel was unclean and loud, and there was a Russian scuba diving school running out of the swimming pool, which I found interfered greatly with my use of the pool and exposed me to lots of second-hand cigarette smoke (smoking was freely allowed around the pool, which didn't suit me as I have bad asthma).

I elected not to stay at the hotel for my further booked night, as it was not what I was expecting and I didn't feel safe or comfortable staying here alone (ie, without my tour group). For the sake of clarity, I've divided the following into issues with the room and issues with the service (which was why I didn't feel safe/welcome) below.

Issues with the room (cleanliness/hygiene): 
Our toilet seat had blood stains on it and our bathroom was full of black mould. There was also black mould in the wardrobe. 
There were also dead bugs on the curtains. I understand that tropical climates such as Sri Lanka often mean bugs +++, but we did not have this problem with any of our other rooms in the country. 
Additionally, I ate at their breakfast buffet on the final morning and noticed a plate of food that was covered in insects. I pointed this out to a staff member who shooed them away and left the plate of food out for other people to eat. I had to be quite assertive about how this was unacceptable and this food was unsafe to eat before the plate was taken away from the buffet. 

Issues with the service:
When I went to speak to reception about the state of my room they were very rude. Basically I felt that I had been mislead by their listing on booking.com (which lists the hotel as 4 stars - it is actually 3 stars, which is quite generous), and I did not want to spend my extra night there. I offered a compromise solution: I was happy to pay the amount that they had paid this website - 20% and then cancel my room for a partial refund. They rejected this and said that they had a blanket policy of no refunds (they then asked me to formally cancel on the website so that they could re-sell the room, which I did not feel inclined to do, so evidence suggests that my cancellation 3-days in advance of the booking would not have left them out of pocket). They also refused to cancel for a man on my tour whose flight was changed and were quite rude during that conversation too.
Interestingly, throughout this whole conversation about me wanting to cancel my booking they did not once ask me why I was unhappy (principally the blood stains on my toilet seat and the mould, which was triggering my asthma), and they became aggressive and defensive. Later that day I had to get my tour guide to speak to the hotel about the issues with my room (as they basically refused to engage with me about this - to their credit they did replace the blood-stained toilet seat after my tour guide spoke to them). 
If you look at the 1-2 star reviews on this website you will notice that most of them have received aggressive/defensive replies from hotel management. I suspect that this review will prompt a similar reply. Rather than argue with unhappy guests they should consider asking for ways to improve and offering apologies to paying guests whose expectations were not met.","Unsanitary and unfriendly hotel in beautiful location","2018-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r641510952-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We thank you for taking your time on posting a review on TripAdvisor about Bansei resort

On arrival we have allocated you a nice deluxe room at our property with noisy of sea waves and we would like to bring you that upon arrival also you were requesting money refund without seen the room saying that adding charges of government taxes then we explained correct figures (Government rule) and it was mentioned in the booking.com voucher also.
  
The booking we received under Non refundable basis from Booking.com and it is very clearly mentioned in the booking voucher which you have got room payment can be taken at the same time.

Around 01.45pm , you  informed to the hotel reception saying that room is not clean , however the room was cleaned and was checked by our hotel house keeper, Anyway we have reclined the room as per your request however the pictures which you have attached with your feedback is not the reality and pictures was very old pictures more than two years back (it was downloaded)

Due to the fully booked situation on 07.04.2018 we couldn't change your room to another room however at the same time we informed to you we will give free upgrade to our most expensive room category called super deluxe for last night and have offered meal upgrade from Bed and Breakfast basis to Half board basis on free of charge.

However still your comment was to leave the hotel asking refund.

This is our positive and genuine comment against to the feedback.

This trip took us to this place: Coral Rock by Bansei 

Arrived with the driver in the hotel, the luggage was carried directly into the interior. The check-in took place sitting on the sofa. With a welcome-drink in my hand, I found it somewhat difficult to fill in the information on the sheet. A table or just the reception would be better suited. At check-in, the amount was deducted directly from the credit card provided at booking.com. This without asking. Too bad, I would have paid cash.
We have received an upgrade, we were very happy about that. The room and the bathroom were very large. We had in the bathroom also a bathtub with whirlpool bath (in such a warm place a bit superfluous, but a ""nice to have""). The hotel area is clean. The ants in the room we could remove immediately. The breakfast buffet is great. A large selection of food. Fortunately, there is also a typical local corner with dahl, curry, etc. Various juices, fruits, sweets, typical American breakfast (with beans and sausages) as well as cheese and cold cuts (superfluous for me). Great!
Staff in the restaurant: The trainee are ""discreetly ordered around"" by the Chef de Service. The trainee do not speak with the guests (maybe they are not allowed). The Chef de Service show up at the guests and conduct small talk.
The cutlery is not completely changed at breakfast after each guest. Only the ""used things"" are renewed. The cutlery already lying on the table, which looks ""still clean"" is used again (for the next guest). This is very unhygienic! Please change this immediately. That's why (e.g.) the placemats were unhygienic. Teach your trainee! They do not know better then and make mistakes. Pity! We only booked B&B and decided to have once lunch at the hotel. It was okay. Nothing special. 
The front desk talks about the guests as they think you do not understand Singhalese. Stupid only if our colleague lives in Sri Lanka for years. 
The pool area is very nice. For towels you have to ask at the front desk. During the day, ""a pigeon crapped on the bath towel"". When I wanted to get a new bath towel, I first had to justify “why”. When I showed them the dirty cloth, I got a new one. Very elaborate and not service oriented. 
The stay was very pleasant. But in a tourist-town like Hikkaduwa, I expect more. The two ladies at the front desk are very nice and accommodating. The gentlemen are fine. In the hotel complex often only my partner was greeted. A ""hello sir"" when I am (as a woman) with my partner; is disrespectful.

Recommendations in Hikkaduwa:
Mom's Coral Beach Restaurant: Food was good, the music was very loud and the service was ok. 
Isira Coffee Shop (No 06 Waulagoda Road, Hikkaduwa 80240, Sri Lanka): Unbelievably good food and very nice hosts. A mix between locals and tourists. Here you must have been.

Overhead shower did not work and the toilet did not flush efficiently. But we thought let’s give this place a go. Then we went to bed!!! Could not sleep due to the noise from the main road below our ‘balcony’ which was a mouldy dirty space with no chairs that has been clad with slats just to obstruct any light that is much needed to brighten the room. Check out the next morning after having the money deducted from our account as soon as the booking had been placed. $584!!! No refund offered as ‘the money had already been taken’ what a waste, they did offer a room upgrade but not until the final 2 nights of our stay as they had no availability. Did not want to end our fantastic trip to Sri Lanka in such a hovel with a bad taste in our mouth from poor management who lied to booking.com as to avoid any refund. Can get better rooms in the area for $30. Avoid at all costs you will only be disappointed for the overpriced rooms. Also the spa is a joke did not even use my free foot massage after watching a guy inspect the voucher for a few minutes and literally stoke my misses foot for 20 mins in what looked like a maintenance cubicle with a table in it rather than a spa. Also tv did not work which they replaced but still terrible reception, breakfast was cold when we arrived at 8:30 and only opened at 7:30-9:30 also no sun loungers at 8:30 as had been reserved with towels by other guest. Not enough beach in front of hotel to lounge on the beach. Birds on the outside dining tables and sun lounges. Wifi also poor. Massive disappointment and biggest regret of Sri Lanka trip.

On top of that we have prebook’ed our Christmas dinner where excellent food including an enormous variety on the terrace facing the ocean.

Thank you so much for your review of your stay at Bansei resort Hikkaduwa posted on TripAdvisor.
In this case we had same complained afternoon time from the another in house guest that your team playing loud music at the first floor lobby area. Myself and Front Office Manager has explained the guest and they have understood very well and still we did not inform you to regards. 

Around 8pm you have complained to the reception that the music was loud.But as you know they have not use any DJ or other electric instrument except Bongo.
However with my advice the front office manager talk to you and apologized from you at the same time. 

As well as front office manager short it out after talking with other guest who was singing at the pool deck area and they have stopped at around 9.20pm.

So as usually every resort type hotels have music till 10.30pm.
 
Anyway if you feel uncomfortable at your stayed in Coral Rock by Bansei resort once again apologize for the inconvenience.

Please feel free to be in touch with me directly for any further queries.

This was not a nice place to stay. Filthy and unfriendly!

736452214

When we arrived at the hotel we had high expectations. The hotel looked very nice. Then they showed us the room. It was a kind of bungalow with sitting room, bathroom and bedroom. But it all looked very outdated and expired. The bathroom was filthy: hear from previous visitors, soapholder looked as it wasn't washed for a long time. Dead bugs on the floor.
Next day when we came back at lunch the room wasn't done. We asked at reception and they promised us to do so in the afternoon. At evening room still wasn't done. Again reception promised us to do so. The only thing that happened was that we received 2 clean towels!
At the restaurant for breakfast we couldn't sit where we wanted. Although the hotel was almost empty we could not take place at a table by the window because it was a table of 4 and we where with 2. When we mentioned all other 4 person tables at the window where occupied by only 2 people they ignored us. If the restaurant would be overcrowded by visitors i can understand there statement but after us nobody entered the restaurant any more and only 4 tables of the 20 where occupied.
Breakfast was from 7:00 til 9:00. We arrived at 7:10 and a lot of plates on the buffet where already empty.","This was not a nice place to stay.

First hand experience is wonderful , that is from the reception when booking the hotel via phone and at the check in . 

After that lot of disappointing factors. Started with room having very poor air conditioning and ceiling fans were rotating at snails speed . We found it very difficult to bare as the climate is so warm. 

We Informed reception and after couple of minutes 2 technicians came . We explain the scenario and they checked and called someone and requested to change the room . Then after another 15minutes a lady came , I think she is the house keeper , checked the A/c and Fans again and went off. After about 10 minutes she came again and informed that they are going to change the room. 

These checking should have been done by them before my arrival and wasting guest's time to do their checks is not at all reasonable. 

The entire show took more than good 1- 1 1/2 hours and our evening was half ruined. 

Next is the lunch , nothing to select . Only two options either to go with Nasi Goren or to  go with English something . Its a disaster.
 
Pool is ok & clean, but no life savers where the deep end is 8 feet . Pool attendant is so friendly and helpful. 

After a disappointing lunch we expect something special for dinner . That again it was like a nightmare   nothing much to select . They had a grill corner with only chicken and fish . This is not at all acceptable from a hotel in this caliber. Never seen prawns or crabs or any other meat item during our stay other than Chicken and Fish.

Not much of a difference in  breakfast , so I'm not going to explain more on that . In short it is a total loss . No entertainment , No proper service , No good food , No comforts . Very disappointing stay. 

In our stay we did not notice many guests , may be because of their very poor standards, no one is willing to come here.","Not up to standards needs lot of improvements","2016-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1500185-d308528-r420907286-Tamarind_Tree_Garden_Resort-Katunayake_Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Thanks for your review. The name Asbestos for the roofing is misleading. The roofing is made of corrugated fibre cement. Asbestos is not used anymore since decades, only the name is still used for this type of roofing.
We offer both toast bread and local white bread for breakfast. As most guests request toast bread it's the default, but local white bread is available.

Perhaps pre-COVID this place was a palace.
When we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff, however, walking to our room we felt something was off. Lots of bare concrete, akin to a low-security prison complex. The views from the room were…basic. It was effectively just bracken and bush. The bedroom and bed was full of bugs, perfect for people who want to to be bitten, or want extra crunch when they roll over in the night.
The shower came off the wall in my hand.
The internet was insufficient. Given it’s locality, one is basically trapped inside the compound, and expected to pay through the nose for low-quality food. Menu highlights include french fries for nearly 2000 rupees, and  plain spaghetti. When I enquired further, I was relieved to find out I could order a separate sauce. Delightful, I’m sure.
Oh, and each and every time I bothered the ‘helpful’ staff for anything; bottle of coke etc, I was expected to pay a service charge.
My advice; avoid. If not, order everything all at once.

Maybe stuff has changed. Maybe this place has got old but I trusted the reviews for this one and BOY could I not have been more naive. An absolute soulless, personality free white complex, that looked nothing like the pictures,
had no redeeming features and was about
as relaxing as taking cyanide. Our room was
crawling with bugs, mainly on the bed so we
ended up sleeping on their squashed corpses
The mossie nets did nothing -I had stuff
crawling over me all night. I'm aware we are in
the jungle but I've stayed in a tent in the middle
of the Amazon, a rainforest in Borneo and a
wooden shack in the Yucatan and a boat on
the Ganges that wasn't this awful. I was itching
all night. The place looks like a grey, flower free
concrete prison compound, with a dirty, pit like pool slap bang in the middle for your to awkwardly sit at and stare at nothing while the staff walk past. The balcony has hard, had cushion less wooden chairs that looked into bracken, mud and stuff they were building. No
idea which hut had 'views?' all the power went
off randomly in the night. The shower barely
worked (couldn't get the rainforest head to run
any warm water so had to use the power free
handheld bit), metal bits kept falling off it and at one point it just completely fell off the wall (picture included). 
The food was nice but three times the price of
anywhere else in Sri Lanka as they know you are
stuck in the middle of nowhere. As an example
a side of fries cost nearly 6 dollars. Another 
delicacy' was a plate of plain pasta without sauce. No joke. The fact this place was 50 or so bucks (without add on) a night begs belief, it was worth about 20 and that's being
kind. I've stayed in better hostels. The rooms The rooms are sparse with no free toiletries and one pillow each. I've never felt more mislead by reviews and the photos of a pretty flowery garden that didn't exist. We were meant to stay two nights but barely lasted one. We cancelled our planned safari too as I wanted to run away screaming and also dread to think how bad that would have been. It was the most disheartening place we have stayed in our month in Sri Lanka. Never believing reviews or heavily filtered photos again. - a proper insta vs reality scenario I wish hadn't been privy to. Overall, one night, a meal for 2, a couple of drinks, in dumpy cell ended up costing nearly 85 dollars (every single time someone brings something to your room, however small - you get charged). I'm revolted with my experience and wish I'd asked for compensation ","Our worst experience in Sri Lanka - ugly room, broken shower, a view of mud, soulless rooms, crawling with bugs and unbelievably","2023-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d13804085-r891237202-Jungle_Paradise-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

This has been an absolutely infuriating experience, and I would strongly urge everyone to steer clear of this hotel. They do not honor their reservations, and can cancel your booking at any time if the price goes up as your travel date nears.

We had booked this property in advance via Agoda from 24th Dec for 2N.
We reached Nuwara Eliya on 24th evening around 7pm and the hotel informed that they had cancelled all bookings via Agoda due to some payment issue with the company.

Well, they should have just delisted their property on Agoda in that case rather than causing a nightmare for the guests during busy holiday season. Not to say ruining our Christmas eve. 

Thankfully, they had availability in more expensive segment. We went with the same.
Price was much cheaper than Agoda- They had still not delisted and continued to take bookings!!

Room was comfortable. Heater was not very effective though.

The staff was extremely rude and seem to prefer only Sri Lankan guests.
They refused to pack breakfast for the early morning trek at Hortons Plains- which is quite common and given.

The lady manager created a ruckus for checking out at 12:15pm rather than 12Noon. 15minutes!! which they completely ruined our christmas eve.","Extremely Rude staff.

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent experience at Araliya Green Hills Hotel. We deeply regret the inconvenience and distress caused during your visit and sincerely apologize for the challenges you faced.

We understand how frustrating and disappointing it must have been to arrive at the hotel after hours of travel, only to encounter issues with your booking. Please allow us to clarify that the situation was a result of an ongoing dispute with a third-party booking platform. While this is by no means an excuse, we recognize that it has caused significant disruptions for our valued guests, and we are actively working to resolve the matter to prevent further incidents.

We regret that this situation may have led to an impression of unethical behavior. This is certainly not reflective of our values or commitment to providing a welcoming experience to all our guests. Your feedback is invaluable to us as we continue to improve our processes and communication to avoid similar situations in the future.

Once again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment caused. We hope you might consider giving us another opportunity in the future to provide you with the exceptional service and hospitality we are known for.

Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact us directly at your earliest convenience.

We deeply regret that your booking through Agoda was not honored as expected and understand how upsetting it must have been to arrive late in the evening on New Year’s Day only to face such a situation. The reported cancellation and the misunderstanding between the hotel and Agoda are truly unfortunate, and we are investigating this matter thoroughly to ensure such incidents do not happen in the future.

Regarding the offer of a room at a higher rate, we apologize if this came across as an attempt to take advantage of the season. It was not our intention, and we are committed to improving communication and transparency in situations like this.

Nous avons ensuite voulu boire un verre à l’étage indiqué, mais il n’y avait personne pour nous servir. À cet endroit se trouvait également la piscine, qui paraissait agréable sur les photos, mais elle s’est révélée petite et froide.

Un autre point à noter est que pour accéder à l’espace spa, nous avons dû utiliser la lampe de notre téléphone car le couloir n’était pas éclairé.

Pour le dîner, nous sommes descendus dans la salle à manger située au demi sous-sol. L’espace était vaste et bruyant, bien que peu fréquenté à ce moment-là. Nous avons commandé deux mojitos, mais avons attendu plus de 15 minutes avant d’être servis.

Enfin, notre chambre donnait sur une arrière-cour où se tenait un mariage, ce qui nous a exposés à la musique forte jusqu’à minuit. Heureusement, le bruit s’est arrêté à ce moment-là, car nous devions nous lever tôt à 4h30 pour visiter le parc Horton Plains.

Firstly, I had read a few reviews ahead of time, and it got good reviews, but I also made sure to check online for the menu.  It had several pictures of an extensive menu displayed (roughly 3-4 pages worth including burgers, pizza, etc.) yet when I sat down and asked the waiter for the menu he passed me a tablet with a single page (only 5 or 6 items on the menu).  I tried scrolling thinking there were more, but it would not scroll!  So I decided on the wok rice with chicken and pineapple juice.  The food preparation took a normal amount of time, and the pineapple juice was good, however, the wok rice with chicken was absolutely horrible.  There was next to no taste, and the only spice was the black pepper added to the chicken.  After spending 2 weeks in Sri Lanka and having some amazing food, this was by far the worst meal I had.  But it does not end there... after finishing I moved my plate to the opposite side of the table and waited.  It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the waiter finally realized I was done (and only because his coworker noticed and sent him over).  When it came time to pay (I had checked before eating that card was OK, which I was told it was) the waiter brought my bill over, did not show it, and took my card which he disappeared upstairs for 3-4 minutes and came back with my receipt.  At no point during my meal did the waiter come by and ask how the meal was, or if I wanted anything else.  This place was absolutely disappointing, and I was very upset with the lack of service and quality of the food.  Something else I noticed, I had been eating all across Sri Lanka for the last 2 weeks (including Colombo) and the only charges on my bill were service charge (mostly 10% of the bill), however, this place I noticed added a 'goverment tax' of almost a third of the bill which I had not seen on any other receipt I received over my entire stay in Sri Lanka.  I would not recommend this place.","Food and service was horrible, not to mention ridiculous prices  (along with an unknown charge)","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r992103428-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

This is to inform you of a disappointed service & treatment by your ME Colombo staff.

We chose your hotel for this with past personal experience. But, I was shocked.

* Requested place was not given. It was not reserved at all and another team occupied that location at the same time. Your team confirmed to give the place that I requested by sending a photograph of the location
* The given chairs were not comfortable at all. 
* Team was not allowed to get into the lift from the ground floor and asked to go to the 1st floor to use the lift. But, a customer who came in an Audi was allowed (discrimination) 
* Doorman didn't have a smile at all
* None of the roof top waiters were friendly and had frowning faces like my team is a threat and a pain to them
*Tea or Iced Coffee preference was not asked and all were given Iced Coffee (Iced Coffee was not good at all)
*Also, one of our team fallen sick on the same day night

Thoroughly disappointed. Please speak to me if you require further details.

The amount paid for a person was comparatively lesser than most of places but its not that cheap either. They spend so much on social media marketing and when we try to get some information no one follows up. It has been over months and no response was still received for inquiries.

However, the buffet barely qualifies as a buffet since the varieties and the spread was very little. Even their salad bar exceeds items from thier mains. Most of the items were vegetarian including the soup and you could barely find seafood. Only a fillets of swordfish was available and the seafood noodles had cut up small prawns which is not that much(hard to find the pieces) . Action station was also available but also vegetarian. Their only rice main which is the biriyani is made from ""keeri samba"" instead of basmathi rice. 

They don't fill up the food trays more often and that tray isn't filled all the way so you have small portions inside those. Desserts were okay and was delicious. Overall the food tastes good and presentation was okay. 

The only perk of the buffet is that they let  you use the pool. The pool has an incredible view and had to give some stars for that.

I would not go for buffet anytime soon there since with an small additional amount you could have a decent buffet minus the pool somewhere else.","The Buffet","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r936930358-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Firstly front of house staff were very helpful during our stay and a special mention to the gentleman, Mr Lalith, working the bar at the pool.
Our room was good but the floor was not cleaned very well as the soles of our feet were “black” from walking around in bare feet.  
The servicing of the room was lacking due to attention to detail in just some minor areas – we had to ask to have the toilet rolls and coffee replaced on a couple of occasions.
Now the major problems of the hotel.  We were on level 5 and were faced with constant barking of the dog from the penthouse above.  I believe the owner might live there.  Not what residents want to hear as they try to go to sleep.  
The roof top swimming pool – great set up and view of Colombo however here are the problems:-
•	It is a very small area yet day users were in regular attendance not leaving much seating/space for hotel guests.  
•	On one day they were 10+ men basically taking up one half of the pool area and they were also drinking.  No issue with having a drink but two bottles of Bacardi and glasses in the actual swimming pool!!
•	On another day a group of 7 day users taking up too much space and they didn’t have money to pay their bill.  Not fair on the staff.
•	The parties held at night again are not fair to hotel guests trying to get to sleep but the music is quite easily heard on level 5.  When they finally stopped a staff member was dragging the furniture across the tiles which again was quite loud on level 5.  I actually had to get out of bed and go up to the pool area to ask the staff member to lift the furniture rather than dragging the furniture.     
•	The hotel needs to decide are they running a hotel or running a nightclub?  
The building is not sound proof and we would not recommend to anyone if you want a decent nights sleep.","Hotel or Nightclub?","2020-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r751840097-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your comments even though you were you were not staying with us, sir
understand your situation and regret for the inconvenience.

Room rates were agreed by someone else and had had paid for the initial period. the hotel agreed to charge the same rate since it was a very special rate offered to the group which was paid by you.
we agreed to take the amount from you since the shortage of funds you had as you mentioned.

Thank you for your comments and regret for the inconvenience caused at the last minute/

But it is really sad to see the same since the rate issue was sorted 2 days prior to your departure and there were no guests kept waiting... For your information, sir we will and will not hold our valuable guests back for a third party issue, Sir. Your family were well taken care of, but we had to keep them informed.
Rates were agreed few days back and was paid for a period and part of the balance was paid by you as per the money you had, sir.

Hope you understand, sir.

As mentioned please contact us directly for your next trip to Sri Lanka.
will make sure that you get the best!

The rooms we booked we were told the price was different to the price we were charged in the end. Which we paid in FULL with there signature stating we had paid in full. 
After leaving a few of my family members stayed on 2 days. This is where the biggest issue arose as they were told that the bill hadn't been cleared and they would have to clear the remaining amount of $500+ if they wish to leave the hotel. 
we were shocked when we heard this. After much argument they said if the dont pay they cant leave.
During the period if argument which we had over the phone as we were back home. My family was held in the hotel unable to leave. With them being now late for the flight we had no choice but to pay the remaining amount.

When booking holiday the hotel was for Englishbreakfast buffet. Only time it was was when the weekend came and the hotel was still not full we had buffet on for the weekend.
Pool area needed attention concrete edges were breaking up.
Stairways were not lit when needed.
The staff were polite and helpful, pools boys were great.

Poor breakfast (little choice, staff can’t cook a proper omelette, no fresh bread) and one day they just removed the whole buffet and made us order from a tiny a la carte menu

Low quality room (you get an ancient key, a/c makes huge noise, no black out curtains). Furniture on balcony worthless. Bed okay though. Sound proving not optimal either. 

Pool area makes no sense (staff seem more content to speak to eachother than actually work). When I asked for another parasol they initially told me that our daughters just had to sit somewhere else. Pool shallow. Beach useless, no swimming in the ocean. 

They say they have a gym but it is actually in their sister hotel Jetwing Blue which did have a proper breakfast room and buffet. 

Huge craw problem that steal your food or snacks. Constant noise of craws can be irritating (but same at other negombo hotels).

Thank you very much for taking your time to share your review on TripAdvisor, following your most recent stay at Jetwing Beach.
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment you experienced during your visit.
We understand your frustration and we apologize for the misunderstanding regarding the pool usage policy.
Our hotel has been operating as an adults-only property since September 2023 as we have been accommodating the Emirates Airlines cabin crew, and will continue till 30th April 2024. Hence, we do not accommodate guests under 18 years. Also, as a policy, when the hotel is running on high occupancy, we limit accepting non-resident guests to use the swimming pool, provided that the resources such as sun loungers are limited. This is done purely to avoid any inconvenience to both our resident and non-resident guests and is not based on any discriminatory term. However, we understand that these factors should’ve been communicated to you in an appropriate manner.
We strive to provide exceptional service to all our guests, regardless of nationality or background, and it is disheartening to know that we fell short of meeting your expectations on this occasion.
We appreciate your valuable feedback as it helps us to identify areas for improvement and to ensure that all our guests have a positive experience.
Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience caused, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with the excellent service that you deserve.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Thank you very much for taking your time to share your feedback based on your experience in making an online reservation at Jetwing Beach.
We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused due to the confusion in the rates and the subsequent communication by our reservations team. As you have correctly mentioned in your comments, the room rates were significantly low on the day in question, and this was due to an error by our team who uploads and maintains online rates.
Our actual rate was LKR 33,900 and the rate your booking had picked was LKR 2,301.56 which is a rate Jetwing Beach will never offer even at the best promotional campaign.
Although we spoke to you to explain about this genuine human error in feeding the rates into the system, upon your dissent to pay the normal rate, we accommodated your booking being a responsible organization which places the interests of our guests in the first place.
We trust that you did enjoy the stay and our hospitality, and hope you would continue to patronize Jetwing Beach despite this experience.

Pretty usual right? After several hours I got an email from the Jetwing reservation team saying the rates were lower because of a system glitch and now I have to pay more than what I agreed to. 

It did not look like a glitch to me as I refreshed the website multiple times to be sure the rates are correct. As any other customer I'd expect Jetwing Beach to honor my reservation which was already confirmed and paid in full. But the reservation team insisted that I pay the ""new"" rate. This behavior from a 5-star hotel is unacceptable and utterly disappointing. I would avoid this hotel next time as I don't want to be scammed again.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor after your recent stay at Jetwing Beach. We genuinely appreciate your valuable input.
We sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by the tax calculations. It seems that we were unable to effectively communicate how the taxes were calculated during your visit. Please allow us to clarify: in accordance with government regulations, all purchases made at the hotel are subject to a 10% service charge, 2.5% Social Security Contribution Levy, and 15% Value Added Tax (VAT). VAT is applied on top of the service charge and the Social Security Levy.
We have made an effort to mention this in all our menus in a clear and concise manner, however we will also ensure that our associates are re-trained to properly communicate to this our guests, to avoid any confusion in the future. 
Despite the issue regarding the tax calculation, we hope your vacation has been a pleasant one and that you had an amazing time visiting Sri Lanka. We are grateful for your understanding and would like to assure you that your feedback will be taken seriously and used to enhance the guest experience.
We thank you once again and we hope this experience will not deter you from providing us with a second chance to restore your lost confidence with a better and improved stay in the future.

For the most part the staff were very nice, there were excellent cocktails which are reasonably priced (although beware prices don’t include tax unlike most places so they seem cheaper than they are) and the room was clean and comfortable. Also on the weekend they do a street food thing across from the hotel where the food is really authentic (read ferociously spicy), super tasty and cheap. 
Overall though I was not a fan. We stayed for 1 night at the end of our trip. Firstly I just didn’t like the area, I wish we had gone back to Colombo. The beach is fine but full of hawkers and mosquitoes. 
The biggest thing that put me off was my experience by the pool. My husband was going to the gym (which is in the other hotel) so I went to sit by the pool. As others have mentioned none of the loungers are actually on hotel property, all on the beach and although there are palm trees they do not provide full shade. Getting towels I had to speak to the attendant who gave me the 3rd degree on who I was, if I was a stewardess, where my friends were etc, not in an accusatory way, just really creepy. The towels themselves were gross by the way, totally threadbare and filthy. So already uncomfortable I went to sit down (with the attendant still hovering trying to talk to me) and realised a hawker was already making her way towards me trying to engage. I felt so uncomfortable on my own I just packed pack up and left and hid in the room until my husband came back. 
At breakfast they were doing the set menu thing which I find very odd as surely there is more waste that way as people have to order more to get the selection they want. They did give us the option to go next door to the jetwing blue buffet which we did, but again you have to run the gauntlet of hawkers. 
Overall as I said I would much rather have been back in Colombo. The 30 min transfer time you save is not worth staying in the hotel or area in my opinion.","Hit and miss","2023-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r883384231-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

And horribly old. The beach is a no better place to be - old and broken deck chairs and stained cushions. Stray dogs and crows add to the ambience. Sellers are constantly trying to sell products at the beach. 

The restaurant and the food offered at the beach are average - the chairs and tables are so old and badly maintained that the whole place make u only happier when it comes time to leave.

The room was really worn down, with a lot of the furniture and appliances needing urgent replacing. Air conditioning was old and moody. Some of the wall mounted appliances were coming off, others just didn't work at all. The sound proofing was very poor, if you happened to have any neighbours next door you could easily hear all their conversations, same for any traffic down the corridor...

Hotel restaurant was average, food selection was ok, however on the first two nights there was a set menu instead of buffet and some of my courses arrived cold. I was advised guests staying at the Jetwing Beach could use all the amenities of Jetwing Blue, yet the one day I tried I was told it was impossible to even get a drink from the bar unless I'll pay in cash (no card accepted).

The beach is very long and wide, but completely overrun by hawkers who kept staring and nagging hotel guests all day long. Due to the proximity to the port it was also quite dirty... 

I really love animals but the amount of stray dogs that were practically residing in the restaurant was a bit too much even for me. Same goes for the number of ravens/crows that were all over the place and stealing food whenever you left it unattended forever a split second.

The only really good thing about this hotel was the staff - great, kind and friendly people who made my 3 day stay bearable.","Disappointing hotel","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r833387749-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Our 3 night stay did not live up to what this hotel is promoted to be. 

Firstly I would like to note the good things: welcome on reception.
Room was kept well clean (this is despite a minor issue on day 1 but when we raised it housekeeping were terribly apologetic and kept the room spotless thereafter) 
Because the occupancy was low we got an A-La carte menu instead of Buffett at dinner, on 2 nights and the food was very good. 
We had a very good experience in the spa. 
The drinks are reasonably priced. 

Despite the above we would not recommend staying here.

COVID measures are not followed.  Many staff do not wear the mask properly. At the Buffett there were no gloves and minimum sanitising stations. 

The service in the restaurant was slow, the staff are not very observant / attentive and it seems that only the manager knows how to open a bottle of wine.

The Buffett was not properly prepared e.g. forks were provided instead of tongues for fruit , cake , salad dishes which made it very awkward to pick up the food and as a result there was food spilled on floor and I did witness guests using their hands to pick up food which was very unhygienic.  On our first experience of evening Buffett, it was 7.20 PM before it was ready despite the restaurant opening at 7.00 PM.  

The pictures are misleading.The pool area is actually overlooking a public beach. And all the sun loungers are on that public beach. You therefore end up with all the local beach sellers coming up to you constantly throughout the day trying to sell to you. It is really uncomfortable and not at all relaxing everyone therefore tries to take a sun lounger in the back row which is closest to the hotel. There are also lots of stray dogs wondering around and many times they would end up under your sun lounger or next to you in the restaurant.

There are 5 umbrellas and only 4 are working. If you get there late and all the umbrellas are taken, you need to sit under the palm trees for shade and be close to all the local beach sellers who will sit and stare at you. This is very uncomfortable and I don’t think it helps that the pool attendants/ lifeguards seem to know them and will stand there chatting with them for a long time (usually with mask down) 

There are 3 side tables available only, so again If you are late and don’t get one you have to hold your drink or risk putting it on the sand  next to a stray dog.

The staff are generally friendly but there is a lack of attention to detail and attentiveness. E.g. they will serve food and drinks on the beach but will not come back to take away the plates / cups when you finished unless they are returning from serving some one else. That famous Sri-Lankan hospitality is lacking, it did seem that some of the staff were overstretched in some areas and over staffed in others and there was a general lack of motivation. 

This place is really on suited to being an a one night stop over to / from the airport. 

When we booked it (via emirates) it was promoted as luxury destination and good end to our honeymoon trip around Sri-Lanka but  unfortunately it really did not live up to the same standards as other hotels we visited during our honeymoon.","Would not return or recommend for more than one night","2022-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r830048586-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We are really saddened to hear that your experience with us at Jetwing Beach did not meet your expectations. 

It is more disappointing that we fell short in extending a world class service that Jetwing is known for following the remarkable experience you had in our sister properties at Yala and Jaffna. We would like to extend our most sincere apologies for having disappointed you. We will certainly be looking into this seriously to ensure that this would not repeat itself in the future. 
 
We hope that this would not deter you from visiting us once more and allow us to restore your faith in our hotel and brand once more.

I am deeply saddened upon reading your review and truly disappointed in knowing you had been let down in all aspects by not meeting the quality of service we are known for. 

We are truly sorry to hear of the injuries to the children and I am sure it must have been very disturbing. Wish we had been informed of the incident as it happened so that we could have provided professional medical care. Immediate steps are been taken to check the entire pool to ensure safety. 

We at Jetwing consider guest feedback to be of utmost importance as it helps us for continuous improvement. Concerns of the feedback is shared with the team in order to find solutions for the service inconsistency and to improve service delivery. The root causes for the service issues will be identified and solved promptly.

We sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity to serve you.

Maybe we visited at the wrong time time then!?! I generally don’t bother to do reviews but felt I had to make an acceptation with this one. 
This is my review for the hotel in low season:
 Rooms were VERY basic and dated in furniture, decor. 
Also...why make the rooms so dark with poor lighting...just don’t get that!!
The pool very poor; one was overly chlorinated (3 days we where there I could see used wrappers left floating around the pool) whilst the children’s pool very poor state. All three children playing there had cuts on their feet to poor standard of tiles and general pool maintenance.(tiles coming away from the floor of pool, side of pool...even the concrete supports weathered away and crumbling. Complained to management about this...it only took until we checked out and literally loading suitcases onto the bus for management to acknowledge  my complaint and talk to me mumbling a pathetic excuse about “...only just being told”
Restaurant had wild local stray dogs freely running through with ...restaurant staff just standing by looking on! Restaurant staff VERY slow to deal with customer requests even for a simple glass of water...waited 20 minutes before getting it myself from back of the restaurant. Restaurant staff really looked as if they couldn’t be bothered and didn’t want to be there. 
Generally very poor hotel and disappointing stay.","Disappointing stay, woeful rooms, pool and facilities, restaurant staff were very poor and very lacking in hospitality","2019-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d308529-r691631500-Jetwing_Beach-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

I called the front desk who sent a couple guys to douse my bathroom in pesticide and kill the roach. The very next night - yet again - when I got up to go to the bathroom in the night, I found a live roach crawling on the shower mat. It ran into a hole in the wall. That's three giant cockroaches in the span of two days. I hate cockroaches and knowing that my room - and thus the entire hotel - was crawling with them made me jumpy, paranoid and highly uncomfortable throughout my stay. I realize that roaches live in tropical places like Sri Lanka, but this is the only hotel during my two week stay that I encountered this issue. In addition to the roaches, the property itself needs a complete makeover. The door in our bathroom was detached, for example, and the AC was not functioning properly.

This is definitely not the same standard or category as the other Jetwing hotels we were fortunate to have stayed at namely Vil Uyana and Yala. 
 
. The sun loungers were broken with torn and worn mattresses.

. The beach was strewn with joint butts, plastic bottles and drink cans and nothing like the glorious, clean beaches we had left behind in Bentota.

. The swimming pool was dirty with rust spots on every tile and generally not enticing. 

. Beach vendors selling their goods were intrusive.

. The rooms were large, clean but tired.

. The staff were indifferent and certainly not as friendly or welcoming as other staff we had encountered on the rest of our 15 day tour of Sri Lanka.

.  At lunchtime we witnessed a chef at The Deck place king prawns on skewers without wearing gloves and then handling cheese and salad without washing his hands.   We were nervous about eating anything there due to the lack of basic food hygiene and heaven help anyone with a seafood allergy.  We then went to the main restaurant and ordered a cheese sandwich from the main kitchen! 

For this reason we were not taking any chances and decided to eat dinner (a la carte) at Jetwing Blue just next door.  A completely different property and synonymous with what we would expect and had experienced of the Jetwing brand.

Thank you for writing down about your experience about us. While we  received several very positive reviews, for which we thank our valued guests. We have also received some constructive criticism, which we have not replied to but we have acted on this particular review however, in our guests have been exactly that, for which we are truly grateful.
 First and foremost you came walk in late night, meaning you haven't booked any room in the hotel. Still we accommodate you. Personally being the manager on duty I showed you the room and you said you liked it. Before I hand over the room, I asked you both to wait to have a final touch of cleaning. After you came in the room few minutes later you came down and asked the staff about the mosquitoes insects. Our hotel is situated in the middle of the jungle surrounded with trees and lake. Once you open /close the door and the balcony there is the tendency they  will come inside the room. The next day morning after taking your breakfast and everything once paying the bill you start bargaining about the rates. We are still kind enough to give you discount. Anyway, we are not surprised that you will make this such drama here in tripadvisor.  As a Small boutique hotel we are really disappointed accommodate you as our guest despite of our hospitality and kindness that we gave you. I am hoping this won't happen again in the other hotel that you will visit.

The Manager arranged for us to shower at another hotel 20 minutes away - was NOT ideal for a large family... though I appreciated this offer and only a couple of us took up this .. 

2) WATER LEAKAGE from the ceiling and bathroom wall into our room (Number 1) -  - there was water filled up on part of the floor after overnight rains.   I am not talking about a small annoying 'drip drip' once every few minutes... part of the floor had large puddles... like someone took 2 coffee mugs filled with water and spilled it...  LUCKILY our bag was not under the leak or in the puddle.  I'm not sure what I would have done if it had all gotten wet... 

3) No working wifi .. it was 'barely' working.. it wasn't the end of the world and I realize I am in a Developing nation.. but in today's day and age, you come to depend on using Wifi for many basic things.. and the hotel says it provides 'wifi'!   

Again the Manager showed us their 3 wifi routers.. but which were only working 'every now and then. .... and only  if you sat in the lobby.

Thanks again to the Staff for understanding and admitting they were sorry to have ruined our vacation.  The Manager tried to make up by packing us lunch on our last day and was super nice... and we said we know it's not 'their fault' .. but it IS the Manager's responsibility to work with the Owner have #1-2 fixed ASAP.  That's just plain unacceptable.

Unrelated - the distance from the main road to the hotel is 2 Km (1.3 miles)..and about half is a 'dirt road'.. so not an easy or fun walk esp if it rains.. .  So don't expect to take a walk or stroll  after dinner to some nearby shops or be able to catch a tuk tuk or taxi.. You Better have a car here.","Sorry to give such a low rating.. but here are 3 solid reasons why","2017-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d11702205-r548241849-Athena_Lake_by_Seedevi-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback regarding your stay in our Themed Suite with Plunge Pool. We truly appreciate you bringing these matters to our attention, as it helps us understand where we fell short of your expectations and identify areas for improvement.

We are genuinely disappointed to hear that your experience did not align with the luxurious and royal experience we aim to provide, especially considering you booked our highest room category. We sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered regarding the condition of the room and the overall cleanliness. We understand how these issues could significantly detract from your comfort and enjoyment.

We also regret the shortcomings in our service. The check-in process should have been seamless and welcoming, and we apologize for the delays you experienced. We are addressing the communication issues regarding the room service and housekeeping to ensure our staff provides attentive and accurate service in the future. We also acknowledge your concerns about the overall dining experience, and we are working to improve the quality and presentation of our service.

During our internal investigation, we noted that you interacted with several key team members, particularly from our Front Office and Food & Beverage departments, on multiple occasions.

We understand that this does not change the past, but we want to emphasize that your satisfaction is our priority.

Overall 3/10 
I will actively tell people not to go; it was a waste of a perfectly good weekend.

Room quality 3/10 
From mouldy ceilings above the bed to algae or moss on the side of the plunge pool to dirty-looking bathtub nozzles, water jets or whatever you call them things, they truly hit the mark of a six-figure room stay.

Service 5/10 
All in all, a few of the staff were attentive, but from the check-in and check-out experiences to ""room service not listening to what was asked"" and ""housekeeping doing loud repairs on a Sunday morning behind my room,"" while they were moving the lawn mower below my balcony, it was just a disaster.

Food 5/10
It wasn't bad, apart from the cold BBQ and the not-so-great coffee, we wouldn't complain. But nothing good, nothing to make you feel special or excited.

The long story

I called and made a reservation around 6 p.m. on a Saturday for one of their ""Themed Suites with Plunge Pool,"" which is supposed to be the most expensive room category, boasting about royalty. 

I called and mentioned that I would like to check in about 45 minutes on a half-board basis. I gave my name and number to confirm the reservation.

What I expected-  to get down, give my keys to the valle and mention that I'm checking-in, walk to the reception, get greeted warmly, ask me about  anything .... (why I made the reservation this late, where I'm coming from, make conversation) tell me a little bit about the hotel, the story, serve a welcome drink and get my paperwork done while I enjoy the view/ drink/ architecture etc. for them to be ready and get me set with a room (including my bags being brought to it) quickly so I can get settled.

Or better yet, get asked about why I'm making the booking so late on the call itself, update me on the check-in procedure, ask if I'm driving, advise me on the easiest/ most convenient parking (reserve a parking spot) and get the paperwork ready for me to sign when I get in, so I can pay and get to the room.

What happened- 
My wife pulls our little car up to the entrance. We mentioned our name, and we are checking in. We get down, and they start unloading the bags. Then, we get told there is no valet service and that we need to find a parking spot, which might be on the other side of the road. (luckily, this did not happen, as one of the staff realized how unhappy we were and said we could park just a few meters from the entrance)

We go to the check-in counter, and one of the staff mentions that they are the person who answered my call and we have to check in on the 1st floor and proceed to take us up the elevator (no special greeting, just hi sir, let me take you upstairs)

We go up to the 1st floor, and I give them my credit card and ID card ... 10 minutes later, someone comes with a welcome drink trolly with a king coconut, pineapple and some other fruit as decoration (yes, instantly while looking at it when I asked for a king coconut, he mentioned this was only for decoration and they had ambarella and some other fruit juices), and I was utterly disappointed about the false adverting on the trolly and opted to have water insted of their options. 

Fast-forward 10 more minutes. The front office person to whom I gave my cards returned a form that I had to fill out and sign so I could pay. Finally, about 30 minutes later, we are taken to the room, given a small intro on where the kitchen, jacuzzi bath, and plunge pool are, and left to relax. When we asked about the bags, they took another 15 minutes to arrive. 

They had a special BBQ for dinner: chicken, pork, beef and seafood. While most of the meat was cold, a queue of people at the seafood stall waited for prawns. (yes I understand when the meat is left out for a while, they goes cold, but when you have staff at each of the stations dwindling their thumbs, the least they can do is ask the guest if they want it reheated or made fresh) 

While the restaurant was relatively busy during dinner service, I did not notice any urgency overall. I had to hold my hand up for a few minutes at a time, looking to get someone's attention so I could ask for a couple of wine glasses, a fresh fork (yes, the cutlery that I left on the side plate was taken along with the other plate), or a toothpick. 

When I returned to the room, I called room service and asked for an ice bucket (I did mention that I wanted to use it to chill a bottle of wine) and  I got a bucket with less than half the ice and by itself, no cloth, plate, or stand.  

The following morning, we had a huge puddle of sweat on the coffee table from the ice bucket, so we chose to go to the balcony for our morning coffee. Once on the balcony, it felt like my old place in Melbourne, with my annoying neighbour doing the lawnmowing every Sunday morning. (yes, when I looked, we had the lawnmower going right under us) 

It gets even better when we return to the room; we hear a constant loud banging from behind and later find out that some construction is going on behind the room. 

I won't say much about breakfast. It was neither excellent nor horrible. I had adjusted my expectations at this points, mainly after dinner, lawnmowing and construction morning, but the icing on the cake was the bathtub/jacuzzi and the plunge pool that we did not feel was hygienic to get in.

I mean, with all of the inlets/ outlets looking brown and marks/ spots on other areas, this looked like the amenities at Galleface Hotel before the renovation (the kind you don't want to use.. We also had lime/ green stuff around the plunge pool, mold kind of black spots on the ceiling over the bed and even managed to have a horrible check out experience. 

So either I expect too much, or somebody has lost the ball here.","How Jetwing ruined a perfectly good weekend","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r998623710-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We regret to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations. We would like to address your concerns, particularly regarding the tax policies in Sri Lanka. Taxes on goods and services, including those at hotels, are mandated by the government and are standard across the country. These taxes contribute to the maintenance and development of public infrastructure and services, ensuring that both residents and visitors can enjoy a better experience in Sri Lanka. While this might make some items appear more expensive, it is a common practice in many countries around the world.
We apologize if our service did not meet your expectations and for any inconvenience caused. Your feedback about the slow service and other aspects of your stay will be shared with our team to ensure such lapses do not occur in the future.

The overall view from the hotel and the ambience was great. The staff were very helpful as well.

However, the bathtub in the room was dirty and had strands of hair all over. 

Additionally, the breakfast was a major let down. First there was a set menu not a buffet (understandingly it was a weekday, but would have appreciated if this was communicated in advance), but the main issue was that the food didnt seem fresh, especially the pol rotti which was very stiff. Whilst the menu tried to replicate the buffet, it was no where close to being one. 

Given that this was our first trip for the year, it was a major let down for us.

We were part of a large group, most of which had already checked in. Myself and friend staying in another room were welcomed and asked to wait as they arrange. After about 1.5 frustrating hours of being bitten by mosquitoes my friend finally got her room (with wine glasses that had lipstick stains on them mind you). We were kept waiting, and finally after 2 hours I told them that we are going to go wait in a friends room to send the keys there. Another 30 elapsed and still nothing, it was 7.30 now and we were expected at function by 8 pm hence this was very frustrating. I stormed towards the reception (they saw me coming and seemed ammused by how angry I was) and demanded to know what was going on... one guy finally told me that they are overbooked by 1 room and will be glad to upgrade us to a suite at their nearby hotel. (one which did not even AC rooms) It was almost comical at this point, I had to sit them down and conduct a Hospitality 101 class to teach them that you dont and cant move a room booked under a group. I said if they had no other choice they will have to offer me a car with a driver for the entire night so I can travel up and down, to which they just looked at me with blank faces not knowing how to respond. Finally after indicating to them that I am going to call the owners of the property if they did not sort out my room within 15 mins, we were given a room which was suppose to be a suite but was not much nicer than the standard room my friends were in. 

This experience pretty much ruined our mood for NYE.

However, surprisingly they failed to impress us. 

The check-in was fast and the room was lovely. A balcony with a great sea view was a pleasant addition to the room. They had the room decorated and sent us a complimentary cake which was a nice touch.

However, the food was horrendous. Since the crowd was very less, food was served on a set menu basis understandably. But the portions were tiny and not filling at all. The waiters simply said we can't request more food or order anything from the ala carte menu. Further to that, the choice of food in the set menus were very limited. However during the third meal, we complained to the manager Mr. Nishantha (was very helpful) and he arranged a few additional portions. One would expect to be able to order a decent amount of food if the hotel doesn't offer a buffet. 

On the last day they allowed us to order from their ala carte menu. We ordered two pizzas which were over burnt and tasteless. Only the breakfast was good and upto standard.

At around 12 noon on our last day, the front office called us and requested us to vacate the room by 12 noon. I can understand this request if the hotel was fully packed and had a crowd waiting  to check in. But  I'm sure there wasn't more than 5 rooms occupied that day. This was a utter joke, specially from a reputed chain like Jetwing!

Overall it was a very poor experience and will have doubts to visit this hotel again! I hope the staff and management learns how to treat their customers from their sister hotel, Jetwing Lake.

We spent 3 days at Jetwing Lake and we had a wonderful time there but when we come to Jetwing Lighthouse, it was the worse experience. The food is not up to the standard in Jetwing Lighthouse and the staff is not friendly as well. The last day I had a fried rice and it had some steel wool (used to scrub the wok) in it. I make a complaint regarding this for the chef as well. We had the same meal menu for the two days we spent there. As a Sri Lankan hotel, I expected traditional rice and curry on the menu but it only had foreign dishes and sandwiches only. When we requested rice and curry, the staff told that they are not preparing them due to the less crowd. But in Jetwing Lake we had rice and curry even there is less crowd. Really disappointed about the service quality and food.","Worst experience ever","2020-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r779168238-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking time to post your review on TripAdvisor.

First and foremost, we would like to apologize to you most sincerely for the many inconveniences you have faced while staying with us. We are rather disappointed in knowing that you were not satisfied with our a la carte menu and the service we offered. We will certainly look into all areas you have mentioned with great interest. Thank you for letting us know of our shortcomings, so we are able to rectify them immediately. 

It saddens us greatly to know that you will not visit us again, but we genuinely hope you will give us another chance to show you the true hospitality of Jetwing Lighthouse.

Ayubowan! (May you live longer)

It was pretty spacious and had enough amenities. However, the rest was so poor.

Starting with the restaurant, they had no buffet. Only offered ala cart for all 2 meals (Dinner & Breakfast) we had. Had to choose from a limited menu. Adding further to our disappointment, they took too much time in-between the dishes, although we decided everything (starters, mains, desserts) at one go for them.

The breakfast had more options although it was ala cart. However, again the disappointing delay. Some of the food we ordered never came and we too forgot about it. However, the restaurant should have been more attentive to bring all ordered food to their guests or should have left the menu card with the guests (or are they expecting us to remember everything we order??).

Then comes the Spa. On our seconds day, said the spa was closed for men because they had no staff.

Further, during our dinner, the restaurant manager came in to ask how was the food. Our response was 'fairly ok'. That's it! he never asked why? or what can we do to improve? Nothing!!

The same happened during checkout when they asked how was the stay, we said 'it's alright other than food'. Again, the end of the conversation. Never bothered to ask why.

We do understand the hotel was short-staffed due to a lack of guests in these difficult times (COVID19) but they should have informed us what to expect when the reservation was made.

Overall, utterly disappointed and not worth going again.","Not worth it!","2020-07","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r759708735-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

On checkout we had to wait whilst our room was checked. No problems for us with that. We were then asked if we had the body lotion, approx 20-30ml little bottle from the bathroom guest toiletries. We were asked to return it, which embarrassed us greatly in the front foyer of the hotel. They made us feel like thieves. Every single hotel we have stayed in throughout many countries, the guest mini toiletries are complimentry for guests to use and take. If there had been a sign in the bathroom regarding leaving excess toiletries, we may have found it unusual and different from every other hotel, but it wouldn't have been a problem.
I suggest management do this re signage, to avoid embarrassment of future guests.
Keep in mind this is supposed to be an upmarket hotel, not a budget hotel. We spent a lot of money with them.
So our issue is not with the general hotel or staff, but the management. What could have been a fantastic memory of this hotel has been soured.

Please see below my initial review, as I stand by my assessment of the general staff and Spa;
Beautiful hotel, with heritage feel.
Comfortable and clean rooms, comfy bed. All general staff members, from front desk, restaurant, bar etc.. very friendly and helpful. And, Praveen, Vimukthi and Chamidu looked after us well.
The Blackpool Hotel Laama Spa (managed by Sam and Sia) was wonderful! Ethan and Sia gave us a very relaxing and reviving Javanese style massage, which was perfect after doing the Worlds End walk . Really worth having one of their spa/massage treatments whilst you are staying here. Reasonably priced for a quality and professional treatment.
The chefs provided delicious food, from set menus through to buffet.","Very disappointing after initial promising start😥","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d9554036-r953161567-The_Blackpool_Resort_Spa-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The staff were very friendly and very willing to help but we felt they lacked experience and authority to act on their own. 
The room was brilliant but was in block 3 so was outside the WIFI range.  When we arrived the room had no security safe and the room fridge was on but broken. A security box and replacement fridge was delivered but the second fridge also did not work and whilst we had a security box it kind of defeats the object if you can pick it up and walk away. 
The tv worked but had a poor picture but did have an English film channel. 

The food was very good and there was a great selection one night then a fixed menu the second night.  The bar was good but a little on the pricy side for Sri Lanka. Wine was silly prices after tax the cheapest bottle was around £40.. we bought good wine locally for £8 if the prices were more reasonable we would have bought from the hotel. 

We had a petty issue with water which soured our visit. We had put empty bottles outside the room the previous evening and they were removed rather than replaced then we could not get more free replacement water as reception suggested we had kept the empty glass bottles…. ??? 
They tried to charge us for the replacement water but we argued it away and were given replacement water free of charge in the end.  

TBH we stayed in some amazing hotels but this was not one of them. The money money attitude was poor, WIFi unavailable in the room and the location were poor.

Upon check-in, we got welcome drinks a hot chocolate which was one of the best. I booked a deluxe room with a bathtub as we have a little girl and mountain views when we got shown our room our views were of local housing and our bathroom never had a shower. When I asked the manager he advised that this is their deluxe rooms and they do not have a bathtub, I was disappointed and felt cheated as they lied, but just got on with it. 

Once we unpacked we thought we'll freshen up, have a quick shower and go down to have dinner. The shower only produced hot water for 3 minutes and we were advised we need to wait 30-45min for hot water again. This made me angry and I asked for a change, I asked for an upgrade and they showed me a smaller room and the male manager was trying to convince me that this is a better room. I declined and then he goes we are fully booked. 

At night we switched the TV on and all the channels were fuzzy, lastly the safe was broken too. Most of this only got sorted on our last day. When I asked if they could do something as I never got the room I promised they refused and hid behind the fact that I booked with 3rd party.

We stayed in a guest house that had better facilities than this. 

PROS - welcome hot chocolate, clean room, quite

CONS - male staff unhelpful, facilities are poor, breakfast average, not worth the money

We read your comments in the Tripadvisor.
Our fundamental value is to ensure that each guest leaves the Hotel as Ambassador of the Hotel.. In the event of a problem we make every endeavor to solve the problem prior to departure. As a matter of fact.The Blackpool Hotel guarantees a very happy departure to all guests. 
In the event of a problem at the departure time the Team Members are not only well trained to deal with the same but to find a peaceful solution too.
Therefore, there is a very slim chance of the Guests being offended nor to affront.
Furthermore, we do not congregate in the Lobby as it gives a downbeat feeling to all around.
The whole event has been misconstrued.

HOWEVER at the very end of our trip, after we had all gotten into the van, the manager ran out to our van saying we needed to pay for a dirty towel that they had found in our room. The entire management was in the lobby, demanding we pay 800rupees for this towel which we HAD NOT USED. When the cleaning staff that allegedly found the towel came, we asked him where he had found it. He had no answers. We, very politely told them we had not used it and were not going to pay. They told security to close the gates so we could not leave. Unfortunately we had to catch the train to Ella, so had to pay and leave as we were getting late.

But what came after our stay was both SHOCKING and UNACCEPTABLE.

We were absolutely shocked to find out the hotel sent 2 people to track us down in our next destination. We woke up in the morning in our new hotel and were about to enjoy our breakfast only to be told by the receptionist that 2 casually dressed men on motor bikes were waiting for us outside and wanted to speak to us (they called our driver to ask about our location without giving him reasons). It turns out the Blackpool Hotel had a mix-up and assumed we left the hotel the day before without checking out and settling the bill. We showed the 2 men the invoice and payment confirmation and they just left! I am still confused and angry at how a reputable hotel, which supposedly won a hotel of the year award, could do such a thing. If the hotel believed we did not pay then they could request their payment through booking.com which has our credit card, not send 2 people on a 4 hour journey!!!

We read your review and wish to give below your comments. Our Guests travel from all over the globe, however, many travelers hail from the Europe. An average height of an European is 6 feet and they have comfortably slept without any ado. This has been happening cyclically since the inception. We are surprised to note that your husband's toes were out of the base of the bed. 
The Blackpool Hotel takes pride in providing  the best of food and service at all time to all discerning travelers. The Hotel was occupied to capacity during your stay with different nationalities and we are glad to say that all guests were completely satisfied with the food. Our core value is to ensure that all requests are accommodated at any degree. The Leader of the F&B exerted himself to assist you in respect of vegetarian food. As a matter of fact there were multiple options of vegetarian available in the Buffet and in addition the Hotel offered additional items of vegetarian to your family.
The markings are very clearly recorded in the swimming pool and we are surprised that you missed it.
We wish to inform you that you opted to leave on your own volition. The Blackpool Hotel has won Culinary awards and the most coveted World Luxury Awards. Winning these awards are no cakewalk.  Close scrutiny of guest satisfaction survey, standard of food, levels of service, comfort etc., are few of the yardsticks they bank on.
We have had numerous Indian guests who make special requests in respect of food and the Hotel invariably accommodates all requests and all our comments speaks volumes of the same.
The First aid is a basic necessity of any Hotel of repute and we wish to inform you that at The Blackpool Hotel it is maintained departmentally. 
Many a guest do ask about places of interest, dining out and our Team members are proficient and has the knowledge to answer appropriately. These questions are regularly posed by guests and it is really surprising if they do not answer the queries.
We understand that there were no arguments displeasure shown by guests during your brief stay in the lobby.
There were three different vouchers for three days and the Management is of view that your premature departure was a pre planned episode.

I dnt know understand why TA removed my previous one. 

I am a great believer of the TA community. It has never failed in leading us to some fabulous hotels. So I am still scratching my head on how this hotel could be on top. 

This is definitely not luxury. The bed was small (not even queen) and my husband’s toes were sticking out - he is 5’10”. The food during breakfast was average and dinner was terrible. There was limited options for vegetarians and even that was too spicy for the kids. The F&B manager was unable to fix this.

And most bizarre- the hotel asked us (with two small toddlers) to impromptu leave the hotel on Christmas Eve (though we had booked for 3 nights!), because the owner/CEO apparently didn’t like my husband’s questions!! This was to inquire if there was a shallow end for our 5 year old daughter and pool timings (we were using it at 645pm and as per the rules it’s open till 9pm). He said this was not the time to use the pool!! He also claimed it was international standards, but there was no shallow end or Kids pool, safety jackets or markings for depth! This apparently is the only pool in Nuwara Eliya. The hotel follows none of the required safety protocol. The way the owner was arguing about it needlessly over something which clearly was lacking felt very unnecessary. We must have really affected his ego because we had the manger at our door within half an hour telling us to leave.

And mind you, he threw us out not for creating a scene, being rude or damaging property or picking a fight! Just for asking questions!?! Who does that, and that too on Christmas Eve with 2 toddlers in night!?! And the general manager Muthuramesh didn’t have the spine to stand up to him, and told us so to our face! Oh and this hotel’s favourite line is “this isn’t lip service”. For every mess they make, they use that line.

They even refused to refund our money! For the additional 2 nights we hadn’t yet spent, we insisted and finally after 1.5 hours of waiting on the porch (with Kids) got a cancellation confirmation on email, else we would have been charged for that as well. The 3 nights stay here would have been around $1000! So definitely no small change. 

This is not a luxury hotel for this kind of terrible service. I honestly dnt know how they have received these awards. They didn’t have a first aid kit with necessary items. Just dettol and betadine solution. They weren’t able to respond to simple queries on food or travel around nuwara. While we were waiting for our refund, we saw 3 other customers arguing with the staff about payment issues, delayed taxis,etc. there are already reviews on that. 

Just writing this reminds us of the shock of being told to leave over such an irrelevant conversation and the panic of trying to find a hotel on Christmas Eve with two kids. 

Thankfully the Grand had a last room available on Christmas Eve and Christmas turned out to be wonderful. We should have just gone there in the first place! That’s far superior and you will have a much better experience. Please don’t make the mistake of booking at Blackpool ever!","Avoid","2017-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d9554036-r550900027-The_Blackpool_Resort_Spa-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for the comments you have shared in the TripAdvisor..
We have reviewed your comments and ascertained that you checked during very early hours in the morning.
The restaurant Team members have checked with yourself pertaining to your basis and it was found out that the package starts with dinner. Consequently, they have billed you for the breakfast. Thereafter, on your request the Team members have cancelled the bill.
The Blackpool is a Hotel of repute particularly for the unassuming service standards, delicious food and top notch hospitality.
We are astonished to learn that you experienced very rude staff which is very remote.
Many a comment we have received are mainly on the friendliness of the Staff.
Please do no take this event as a point of judgement, however, visit us again and the The Blackpool Hotel team members will take care of you immensely.

Thank you for the comments you have posted 
The Blackpool Hotel is strategically located which showcases natural verdant surroundings around the Hotel.
In retrospect the Hotel has hosted countless number of guests and nigh on  all guests have showered their appreciation with regard to the rooms, dining areas, outdoor pool and the location.
The Hotel consists of three modern elevators which facilitates ease of travel to any location within the Hotel. In addition each building is closely connected and guests rarely find it dreary to walk around.
We are surprised that you found it tedious to move around.
One of our unique features is the outdoor warm water pool and many guests do enjoy a dip after a arduous day. The temperature maintained in the  pool is  reasonably warm at all times.

Our aim is to provide a comfortable and relaxing environment, and we regret that we did not meet your expectations. Furthermore, we understand your concerns about the room ambiance and are looking into the lighting situation to ensure our guests can enjoy their personal activities unhindered.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delays in housekeeping service and are reviewing our procedures to prevent such occurrences in the future. Additionally, we recognize the importance of a well-functioning room, from the air conditioning to the electric jug, and we are addressing these concerns with our maintenance team.

We also take note of your feedback regarding our location and the perceived value of our food and beverage offerings.

Location… In short miles from anywhere and certainly not anywhere near Dambulla.
Unless you have your own transport they have you by the balls with ridiculously over priced drinks and below average buffets.
Never have we stayed in such a low light room. By which we mean even with every internal light turned on it is impossible to read a normal book.
We are here as part of a group tour, so somewhat locked in, but not tour operators fault.
Every person on our tour has had an issue… Air con not working, Air con remote batteries flat, No hot water, Broken hair dryer, Weird safe with no instructions, No towel rack, No coffee sachets, Electric jug not working, Coffee mate curdling coffee… and more.

Thank you for your review.

We do apologize for the technical problems you encountered; there are absolutely no excuses for such details to be overlooked as all rooms should be thoroughly checked on a daily basis. We will make sure that the procedure is reinforced. However, we do not seem to find any record that our team were made aware of this while staying with us as in this case we would have, of course, changed you to another room.

Your enthusiasm for our team is very much appreciated and will be a great source of motivation, we will certainly not hesitate to convey your compliments to all of them.

I’ll start with the positives, large room, efficient air conditioning, lovely gardens, good size pool and wonderful staff.

Our room, described as ‘ Enjoy a magnificent space… The Duplex room promises guests an unforgettable stay with everything needed for total comfort’. 

As long as by ‘magnificent’ and ‘every comfort’ you don’t mind shabby furniture, light fittings, bathroom, bedding and towels then you will not be disappointed.  

Nothing has been looked at closely in this room (703) for years, it needs a complete remodel and everything replacing.

Even the basics were missing, two coat hangers and one (office type) chair to sit on on the balcony…

I don’t write this review with any pleasure but the hotel really should be marketing itself differently as the photos and description were not my reality in any shape or form.

Rooms
I switched rooms because the air condition was extremely loud in my first room + the bathroom was filthy (mold in shower, surfaces haven’t been cleaned in weeks/months etc). The second room was better regarding the noise of the AC but the bathroom was similarly filthy. I desinfected the toilet myself. There was dirt everywhere and no proper cleaning seems to happen in this hotel.  
Bed sheets and mattress also full of spots. 

Pool
The pool itself is nice. The (newly installed?) water fountain doesn’t make any sense to me, it just makes the place noisier.
The pool bar and staff is underwhelming. Staff inattentive, you have to ask for everything starting with a towel and topper for the sunbeds. Foods and drinks can be ordered but don’t expect the staff to come and ask you if you would like to order something… drinks were fine, food arrived cold.

Pool towels/towels sometimes with spots and/or bad smell.

Public shower and toilet by the pool are also in a disgusting condition, same as in the room.

Restaurant
I booked half board and the variety of food was good and as expected. No complaints here. 
The staff in the restaurant is much better than at the pool. 
However, cleanliness issues are also present here. Table cloths show dirt from dinner the day before etc…

Apparently the hotel is under a new management and in the process of renovating the rooms, as I was told twice while raising the issues with management. I don’t see how the very basics like regularly cleaning the rooms can be excused by a new management… this should be one of the core processes in a hotel. This hotel lacks basic standards. There is enough staff around to make this hotel better but no one seems to care. 

Overall my stay was disappointing and I expected much more. Directly after checkin in I felt that I had made a mistake by booking this hotel.

To be fair, management apologized and dropped my additional room charges (in a rather complicated process with lots of waiting in the lobby) which was nice but I’d rather stayed in a clean hotel instead that had met my expectations.","Filthy hotel with lots of lost potential","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r980970712-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

We are sorry that your stay did not fully meet your expectations. Our hotel aims to be an oasis of comfort, and we regret to hear about the inconvenience you faced. Regarding the distance to the city center, we understand that our tranquil location may not suit all our guests, and we appreciate your perspective on this matter. We also apologize for the delay in delivering an extra towel. We aim for prompt and efficient service, and it seems we fell short in this instance.

Our team is trained to handle guest concerns with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. It is disheartening to learn that your interaction with our reception staff did not reflect the high standards we strive to uphold. We take the presence of local wildlife within our rooms seriously, and have measures in place to prevent such occurrences, though it seems these were not effective on this occasion. Additionally, we regret the issue you experienced with the shower door and the unfortunate incident by the pool. Our guest safety is paramount, and we will review our procedures and facilities to prevent these situations in the future.

Finally, we are sorry that our quality of service did not meet your expectations. We will follow up on your comments to ensure our usual high standards going forward. Nonetheless, we are proud of our hotel's location, which is conveniently situated close to cultural landmarks like the Dambulla Cave Temple and Sigiriya Rock Fortress, and offers a range of amenities designed to enhance the experience of our valued guests.

We hope that you will allow us the opportunity to provide you with an improved stay in the future.

En principio pintaba bastante bien, pero en la realidad dejaba mucho que desear. 
Cabañas chulísimas, espaciosas, pero en las que faltaba limpieza y se veían deficiencias, como que la puerta del baño al exterior tenía un gran espacio por debajo por el que podían colarse toda clase de bichos, la ducha, con dos alcachofas a las que no le han quitado la cal desde que las colocaron, la silicona de la mampara, un poco sucilla, y, para rematar, por la ducha entraban sapos. El personal sacó a uno de mi ducha, y cuando fui a ducharme, lavándome el pelo obviamente tenía los ojos cerrados, pues al abrirlos, otro sapo mirándome. No es nada agradable ducharse pensando que el sapo iba a saltar hacia mí. Y ya, pues el resto de la estancia, mirando por todos los rincones, no descansé nada. Creo que la cadena @barcelohoteles debería prestar más atención a sus hoteles por el mundo, a ese alojamiento le sobra alguna estrella.
La única tarde libre en la que podíamos disfrutar de las instalaciones, no pudimos usar la piscina porque el agua estaba verde, no se veía el fondo.

It's especially close to a couple of the key sights - including Sigiriya and the Dambulla cave temple.  It's a good hour or so from Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura.

Having arrived via quiet, rural roads passing paddy fields and lakes, the hotel on first appearances looks impressive, and actually the expansive, lush grounds and the way rooms are grouped in separate buildings makes for the feeling of seclusion, peace and quiet. As the hotel is not that old, and for the most part it has not suffered too much deterioration or neglect (as it unfortunately seems building lovely, luxury hotels and then not investing in them to keeping things working seems to be a common and besetting Sri Lankan hotel sin, not unique to this hotel) we were initially very happy.  There were a few niggles with the room – curtains that do not close or keep out the light, umpteen light switches which made no sense or did nothing, power sockets in inconvenient places for charging devices, but again pretty commonly found in other hotels.   

I would warn though that the hotel website is inaccurate and if you are selecting it for specific mentioned amenities and facilities, beware.

Of the restaurants mentioned, only the large buffet restaurant is operational. We could not find the second evening restaurant, it’s clearly closed and the space repurposed.  The pizza restaurant is a small building near the pool that has clearly not been used, judging by the grime and mess, for ages.       

The area close to the pool described as changing facilities have nowhere dry to change nor anywhere to leave clothes, plus the shower at these facilities have no shower mat so best to change in your room even if it’s some distance away, and we got no robes and slippers.  They really serve as just a toilet close to the pool area.   

Some room categories are listed as having a jacuzzi.  Ours had one (as we got a room upgrade).  However, it was outside on a patio beyond a locked door from our bathroom and we could see from peering over the wall from our side patio that the jacuzzi and the whole area was neglected, filthy and probably no longer working.  Not sure if others are in a similar state of disrepair.          

Other disappointments included:

Major failings in regard to the day to day dining room, catering and kitchen operations and a lack of hands on management showing any interest.  I won’t go into details because after 2 complaints were made to the hotel on our behalf by our very proactive travel organiser, we did receive apologies and a bottle of wine on our last evening.  I would strongly advise for the widest menu choices and sufficient food, you go for dinner the moment the dining room opens, especially if the hotel is full of large tour groups. 

The second general aspect needing improvement is overall customer facing staff training and consistent service levels.  Reception was often unmanned, and nearby staff who offer assistance in their absence are willing but unreliable.  Turn down service seems to be hit and miss, we had charming staff our first night, never saw them after that and nor did the room next door.  When we needed more bottled water, we had a long wait.   Also, it was very clear staff are not just badly trained, some blatantly work for tips.  Yet there was an entire cricket team of smiley staff constantly sweeping leaves and tidying up the grounds.   

This is a hotel that could be a marvellous 5 star hotel – the facilities are mostly all there, but it seems the current operators are not interested and with tourism numbers on the increase, are filling their hotel anyway.","So disappointing","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d3308737-r941532845-Occidental_Paradise_Dambulla-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

We sincerely apologise, rest assured we have noted your comments and will address them with the corresponding heads of department.

We regret you did not make a member of our management aware of the issues and concerns you mention while on-site so that we could have taken the necessary action to ensure that your experience lived up to your expectations.

First of all, it is our responsibility to investigate on all feedback be it positive or negative so that we may improve on the same and as such having investigated the same, we would like to bring to your attention the following;

As for the construction taking place on a site opposite to the hotel, unfortunately the same is beyond our control as it is not construction to do with the hotel and leaves us with no jurisdiction to intervene. nevertheless as rightfully observed there is indeed a lot happening in Colombo as the city is rapidly developing.

Secondly with reference to your booking changes, We regret to inform that there is a protocol to follow for any prepaid existing booking  which we receives through the online platform .Therefore we are compel to adhere to their cancellation policies. 

Finally, every hotel has their own  policies that allowing guests to visit your hotel room during your stay. By implementing these policies, hotels aim to provide a safe, comfortable, and enjoyable experience for the guests. However, it is always better to check with the front desk beforehand to confirm the specific rules of the hotel you are staying at. 

Furthermore,we will share this with our team so that they may also correct and improve on some of the areas as you have stated.However,please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.  

Thank you for staying at Mandarina Colombo.

It was better than in every way - rooms were cleaner and felt fresher, the service was friendlier etc. I had recommended this hotel to family. We returned to the hotel this weekend, together with relatives who also booked a stay. We stayed in a room for three adults on the 4th floor. It was an oddly configured layout but aside from that the AC units didn’t work - they kept shutting off during the night and then spluttering back to life loudly - so loud that we woke up multiple times in the night every time it restarted. Probably about 8 or 9 times during the night! One of the units was also malfunctioning to the point that it was spraying out a fine mist of water (sounds nicer than it was) so one of our bags On the floor beneath the unit it was damp the whole time until we realised. Our relatives on the 6th floor reported the same issues with their room plus a blocked bathroom sink. On check-out, the staff were perfectly pleasant but didn’t even ask how our stay was. The service this time around was generally lacking. Thankfully we only booked to stay two nights. I won’t return or recommend going forward.","It used to be great, now not worth it.

In contrast, the rest of the staff exhibited a lack of basic courtesy in their interactions with customers, raising questions about their suitability for customer-facing roles.

We take this opportunity to thank you for selecting our property and for the time taken in sharing your feedback with regard to your recent stay at Mandarina Colombo.
It is upsetting us to see your statement which is published though we have given you an especial rate for your direct bookings.Secondly we offered a complimentary breakfast for your entire previous stay as a courtesy for a long stay customer. We honored your request as a loyalty customer. 
However once again we offered an special rate for your guest when you request to share the room as we were unable to proceed on complimentary basis. As you know that there is a limit of offering free of charge for anything which we always try to negotiate as per the guest requirement.
Having read your review we are very disappointed with your comments and feel that it is very unfair to write such a review while been benefited as a loyal customer.

We sincerely do hope that we have been just enough with our justification and wish you all the best for all your future travels.

Thank you for your feedback, but we do not appreciate your negative and incorrect comments especially when our colleague she was found to be rightfully doing what she was instructed to do by your organisation

To put into perspective, when you arrived to the hotel, you were booked through your organisation for isolation purposes and that meant that you are mandated to stay in your room at all times and musisolate in regulation with your organisation and shipping vessel requirements to ensure that you maintain your Covid-19 negative status until you board the vessel.

This also goes to mean that you cannot have anyone in the room with you and cannot have your wife with you either, but despite our best efforts in informing you of these regulations which your company has requested you to abide by, it fell on deaf ears and it is not fair for you to hold that against us and therein make falsified accusations in a public forum that you were delayed in check-in and that our colleague mis-treated you.

All our colleague did was inform you that you can stay in the room and but your wife would not be able to join in the same room as it was against your own company regulation. 

As for your room, according to our records, your room was ready, but you had decided that you would go out for a bit before returning to check-in as you wanted to spend more time with your wife as she was not permitted to check-in to the same room with you and this is again in line with your company requirements.

Your wife then decided to book a separate room to stay overnight but then this was only a ruse as we have clear evidence that you did break the company protocol and grant her access to your room. 

We as such take this review as a form of rebellious action from you to hurt our reputation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"433 Galle Road Colombo 03, Colombo 00300 Sri Lanka","Colombo","Sri Lanka","00300",,"433 Galle Road","Colombo 03","12002902","6.900072","Colombo, Western Province","79.85357","Mandarina Colombo","1432","4.6","28","30","57","296","1021","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293962-d12002902-Reviews-Mandarina_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.mandarinacolombo.com/","2022-01-18","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"First of all ,I came to checking very late around 5:00 pm but still the room was not ready and the receptionist(Dilki)asked half an hour more to wait.

"0","824368356","en","12002902",,"Marketing","825318553","en","2022-01-18","Sales  Manager","Dear MRJ2121,

Thank you very much for your critical feedback and for sharing your feelings openly on a public forum. We truly appreciate your feedback, but we must take this opportunity to elaborate on some facts which you have brought to our attention.

1. We at Mandarina Colombo dare not discriminate. We welcome guests from all 4 corners of the globe and we welcome them with open arms, like Michael Jackson said, ""it don't matter if your black or white"" and that goes without saying ""it don't matter to us if you are gay or straight"". We as a hotel want our guests to be happy and are in the business of making sure our guests love the hotel, their stay and feel refreshed before they checkout. It is very sad that we have not been able to uphold this promise to you and we have taken action against it where we have initiated a training program internally to highlight this very fact.

2. Yes, the hotel has gone through a tough time and understandably with Covid-19 being the cause of all the doom and gloom all over the world, the hotel too has had a tough time with the upkeep and maintenance, especially when we had to stretch thin in the past 2 years to keep the hotel operational with zero tourists and as such much of the maintenance issues you have raised are now being rectified with all seriousness and it goes without saying, the entire building is being critically looked into from a maintenance stand point but will be back to its glory in no time.

3. We are not a Halal Hotel by definition, but yes we do refrain from selling/serving or permitting liquor or alcohol consumption which is our prerogative and but  you are more than welcome to help yourself to drinks outside the hotel in the many bars/clubs located in Colombo.. This very fact is also highlighted in all online Forums where we publicly come out on being a dry concept property.

4. Housekeeping too has been a major impacted area and what you have observed is 100% right and we would not deny it. Again with much of the hotel operation having to be thinned out for the last 2 years, we have now had to get back in gear and that means hiring new associates and that is not easy when the workforce in the country is actively seeking to go overseas for employment, but we have now sought our employees and we are surely getting back on track to ensure that all guest rooms are cleaned faster, better and on demand.

5. As for the chairs, we have an option for guests who would like to take that extra precaution and stay in the room and who would like to have their meals delivered to the room and as such keeping in line with their wishes, we have a chair outside where the food is left for the guest to take into their room. 

6. As for the pool/restaurant, well we are a city hotel and we have to make do with the land which is available to us and as such, we can only go up and the building has been designed to ensure we have all the amenities of a worthy city hotel. Personal preferences may differ, some may not like to be seen when in the pool and some may not like to be seen when having their meal, but we definitely understand that we cannot satisfy 100% of the guests 100% of the time.

We sincerely do hope that we have been able to clarify much of your personal opinions about the hotel but would have loved it and sincerely appreciated if these concerns would have been brought directly to us during your stay as opposed to a public post after the stay as it not only hurts the property who is trying to revive its place in the post Covid-19 era and also deprives us from ensuing that we learn on the job by interacting with our guests.and show how genuinely humbled we are in ensuring our guests have a good stay.","3024","567417391","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/d2/1a/2f/mandarina-colombo.jpg","4032","3024","567417390","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/d2/1a/2e/mandarina-colombo.jpg","4032","3024","567417393","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/d2/1a/31/mandarina-colombo.jpg","4032","3024","567417394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/d2/1a/32/mandarina-colombo.jpg","4032",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"433 Galle Road Colombo 03, Colombo 00300 Sri Lanka","Colombo","Sri Lanka","00300",,"433 Galle Road","Colombo 03","12002902","6.900072","Colombo, Western Province","79.85357","Mandarina Colombo","1432","4.6","28","30","57","296","1021","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293962-d12002902-Reviews-Mandarina_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.mandarinacolombo.com/","2022-01-08","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This was the worst hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka. I had high hopes as the photos look really nice. They price showed as $130 USD and it was marked down to $58USD. At this property, you get what your pay for. First off the room was not clean. The ceiling was stained from the AC unit, the bathroom had a styrofoam square covering something, and the sink was full of black mold. There was construction so you could not go on the balcony- I get that and understand they are remodeling. The staff was not friendly at all. When we booked we did not know this was a halal hotel. I don’t have an issue with that but my boyfriend thinks they were not friendly to us because we are gay. I try to put faith in humanity and think they were just not friendly people and did not discriminate because were gay. There was baseboard missing by the entry way.  We got back to the hotel at 3pm and our room was not cleaned. We asked the guy actively cleaning other rooms so we asked him to clean out and he say it was next. Maybe he did not clean because two guys were staying there?! Who knows. There was also random chairs outside of each room except ours, not sure the meaning behind that. Last the pool was small and there was not an area to lay out by the pool. It was an awkward set up because the people eating at the restaurant could easily see you in the pool. The rooftop is also under remodeling. When we checked out people were also not friendly. I did ask them to print out a few documents and they did that complementary.  I don’t recommended for anyone to stay here so please spend your money elsewhere.

Thank you very much for your feedback but i believe that you have gravely mistaken us for another property.

The reason is because of several factors.

1. We do not employ casual labour in our property, all our associates are 100% permanent and so there is no possibility for anyone to claim that they are casual labour.

2. We operate a central heating system/boiler which provides 24/7 hot water and does not have a room to room system for maintenance as its all centrally controlled and so if there was no hot water in your room then this would be the case in several other rooms, which cannot be as we had no other instances of this nature.

3. As for the AC, again we operate an individual AC unit per room and this is so that the guests have full control of how they would like the comfort level to be in the room and since all our units are regularly checked and so there could not be any possibility that any unit was malfunctioning.

Furthermore, you have stated that you have stayed with us on 31st October 2020, but yet the review is posted on 13th October 2020. How could it be possible for you to have stayed on 31st October 2020, when we are still only half way through October as a month.

We are glad that you did find the food and beverage to be good along with the pool, but yet we think it would be unfair for us to take the positive feedback as ours as we believe that the entire feedback has been written in grave error.

We sincerely do hope that you will seek out the correct property next time before writing a review.

Warm Regards,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay with us at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa. We truly regret to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations.

Please allow us to clarify regarding the charge for the bed linen. Our housekeeping and supervisory team thoroughly inspected the room upon your departure, and it was evident that the bed sheet had significant stains caused by food gravy. We would like to reassure you that it is not our practice to charge guests for minor marks or light stains, as we understand occasional wear and tear is part of normal hotel use.

However, in this case, the gravy stains were deep and permanent, despite our laundry team’s best efforts to restore the linen. As a result, the linen was deemed unfit for reuse. In such instances, we are left with no option but to apply a minimal charge to cover the damage, which was clearly communicated at checkout.

We sincerely regret if this caused disappointment and assure you that the decision was made only after careful review.

Regarding the concern about room ventilation, we will review your room allocation and share the feedback with our team to ensure all comfort standards are met consistently.

We value all our guests and appreciate your feedback as it helps us continue to improve. Should you choose to return to Colombo, we would be grateful for the opportunity to welcome you again and provide you with a more seamless and enjoyable experience.

Best Regards 
The Colombo Court Hotel & Spa Family

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced, and I deeply regret that your visit did not meet your expectations.

We understand how frustrating it must have been to deal with the construction noise. While we strive to improve our facilities, we should have communicated this situation more clearly to avoid disrupting your plans. We truly regret any discomfort this caused, especially when you were looking for a relaxing stay.

We also acknowledge your disappointment about the rooftop bar being closed for renovations. We understand it was one of the reasons for choosing our hotel, and we apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Rest assured, we are working hard to complete the renovations and reopen it for guests to enjoy the full experience.

Regarding your concerns with the room lighting, mirror placement, and washroom ventilation, we are grateful for your valuable feedback. Your observations have been shared with our maintenance and housekeeping teams to ensure such details are addressed and corrected in future designs and services.

We also regret that our Sri Lankan breakfast didn’t meet your expectations. We aim to offer an authentic dining experience, and your comments have been shared with our culinary team to enhance the quality and presentation of our offerings. We always strive to improve our services, and your feedback helps us make necessary adjustments.

On a positive note, we are pleased to hear that our staff were friendly and supportive during your stay and that the hotel's location was convenient for you. However, we understand that your overall experience did not reflect the high standards we strive to maintain.

Please accept our sincere apologies for any discomfort you endured, and thank you again for your honest feedback. Should you choose to stay with us again, we would love the opportunity to provide you with a much-improved experience. Please don’t hesitate to contact me directly (gm@colombocourthotel.com) if you decide to return, and I will personally ensure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.

Greetings from Colombo Court Hotel & Spa!

We are deeply concerned about your recent review and the serious allegations you have made against our hotel and staff. We take such matters with the utmost seriousness and immediately launched a full investigation into the situation you described.

After thoroughly reviewing the CCTV footage and interviewing the staff involved, we have found no evidence to support your claims of inappropriate behavior. The staff member in question had no physical contact with you and only interacted with you in a professional capacity. Additionally, the footage shows that you willingly engaged in conversation with the staff, even exchanging contact information.

We also visited the tourist police in Colombo to report the incident and have cooperated fully with authorities. 

At Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, we prioritize the safety and well-being of all our guests. We handled your concerns with the seriousness they deserved, ensuring that every step of the investigation was thorough and impartial. Your feedback is important to us, but we must respectfully clarify that the accusations made in your review are not supported by the facts of the case.

If you have any further concerns, we encourage you to reach out to us directly so that we may address them.

The reviews of Colombo Court Hotel and Spa were very good so we chose to stay here. When we arrived at about 3, we asked the front desk to book a car to take us to the airport at 1:30 am. Around 6:30, I reconfirmed the car booking and was told that the car would be there at 1:20.

We tried to sleep, but the room that we were given 209, was above the pool, a bar and a common area and had a window that allowed all the noise into the room. I had my earplugs in and covered my ears with my pillow, but still couldn't sleep until about 11 pm.

We went downstairs at 1:20 and waited for the car. By 1:30, the car still wasn't there, so we asked the front desk to follow up and were told that it would be there in 2 to 3 minutes. 10 minutes later, it still hadn't arrived so we insisted that the front desk call another car. They made a call and we were told that it would be another ""2 to 3 minutes'.  Finally at 1:47, the car arrived. No idea if it was the original or 2nd car.

Naturally, the driver had to speed to the airport so that we would get there in time to check in and go through immigration. It was raining and I wasn't comfortable at all with how fast he was having to drive. The entire experience was very frustrating and anxiety-ridden, which was what I had tried to avoid by booking the car well in advance.

We were most unimpressed with our experience here.

Thank you so much for your feedback regarding your high tea reservation at the Amber Poolside. 

Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. 

After investigating this matter with my team, I came to understand that you had corresponded with my restaurant manager Nalin. All sufficient information such as a menu, pricing, and reservation details has been shared with you. He has also assisted you with regard to your meal preferences as well. Going further into my investigation I did come to notice that he had specifically requested if you would like us to replace anything on the menu. Which obviously includes the beverage item as well. However, you had responded back to him stating ""nothing to replace"" which gives us the impression that you are confident about the menu option you selected. Therefore, this clearly shows that there has been a clear misunderstanding on your end regarding the hot and cold beverage items. If you were not happy with the Iced Coffee option, you had all right to speak to our restaurant staff and replace the cold beverage with a hot one. 

Furthermore, with regard to the behavior of the restaurant staff, I have taken the necessary action by conducting training, and workshops on this matter so that they are well-trained and mannered. We will make sure sure this does not happen to any other guest. 

Thank you once again for your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you soon.

Thank you so much for your feedback. 

First and foremost, please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience that you had to go through during your stay. 

The AC machine had leaked due to a block in the AC drain lines. Before your arrival, our housekeeping team and the maintenance team check every single aspect of the room before it’s released to a guest. We inspect electrical items, furniture, bathrooms, balconies, and even the paint condition. The AC machine was also adequately serviced before your arrival. Having investigated this matter we came to know that these sorts of incidents happen once in a blue moon and we were so unfortunate to go through this. 

However, after discussing the matter with you and with your permission we sent the laptop to a local agent, and they confirmed that the computer can be recovered only if the motherboard is replaced. We also checked with them about the possibility of getting this done immediately. Unfortunately, the process would take 1 to 2 months since the agent has to order the parts from Singapore which will consume a lot of time. 

We also spoke to our insurance company, and we got 75% coverage for the laptop. This has been communicated to you and we are still awaiting your confirmation to proceed with the transaction.
 
As a responsible business, to avoid such unfortunate incidents, we have decided to replace all drain lines of the hotel with AC machines. The project has been handed over to the local agent. 

Once again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused and we wish we had control over these sorts of incidents so they can be avoided. 

Best Regards
The Management.

Thank you for taking the time to write us your feedback and also reaching out to me directly. I apologize for the delay in reply as I was investigating further into this.

While replying to your concerns highlighted I would like to inform you that we inform all guests at the time of check-in regarding any events taking place at our premisses. We like to point out that there was no event taking place at the hotel on the dates you stayed with us. We do not host events past 11 PM. But I do believe the buzz you would have heard was from our rooftop restaurant since it closes at 1 AM on weekends. Do accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Thank you for your valuable feedback. 

Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused regarding the condition of the in-room AC. 

I have discussed your feedback with the team as well and I would like to point out the following. 

Once you had informed the reception regarding the AC, our front office night Manager had sent a maintenance team member to look into the matter. I  believe both staff members visited you as well to discuss the solution that they had in place for you. When the AC was fixed our team member had informed you that it will take 30 minutes for the room to get cool down again and as an alternative option we recommended a room change for you. However, you had clearly informed our front office night manager that you prefer the room you checked in to and the AC works fine. 

I believe that my team had provided a solution to your issue. Just an insight into our operations, we run daily AC checks in all 31 rooms and we make sure that everything is at 100% condition. However, due to an unavoidable circumstance, the AC in your room had a malfunction but was rectified within a few minutes. 

We take our loving guests' feedback and reviews very seriously and we always do our best to learn from them and make sure that no other guest has a bad experience with us. A result of this is the feedback you will see prior to yours. 

I would love to welcome you once again to stay with us and experience a home away from home feeling with us. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me. 

Best Regards

Kevin Schumacher 
Operations Manager

Room interior is good but what would you do with the interiors if the split AC installed is 20 years old. The AC was just not cooling the room. We called reception people and they sent the technician immediately. Technician did the obvious job of cleaning the filter and told us to wait for 30 minutes. He himself realised the AC is not working. But then who would convince reception people. I am writing this review sitting in hotel same hot room waiting to get cool. The hotel should be proactive considering there is no one else staying because of corona scare. We had such wonderful time at location like Mirissa, Galle and Bentota, but this hotel ruined our beautiful experience of srilanka with its horrible service. Hope this review reaches them tonight because they don’t care of guests burning in their room. Like I said above and I am stressing again, never go with looks.

I appreciate when my hotel is a restorative haven in the midst of an intense city but unfortunately this hotel was anything but...

The room was fine until all the main lights went out and no one could fix them. More of a fuse issue than a burnt out light bulb. The staff tried to help by bringing extra lamps but not ideal. 
I left my stay early as a result of noise and lack of peaceful ambiance. Unfortunately I had paid in advance and that resulted in me losing a nights stay.

We stayed for one night at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, and given we had limited time we contacted them a few days before to organise a driver for 3 hours to take us around the City (we only had one night in Colombo whilst in transit) so wanted to see as much as possible. We organised 2 children's beds with them in the booking, and were really pleased to receive an email saying we had a personal butler who would organise everything and make our stay smooth.... Well it was terrible. On arrival they had the wrong room type set up, then tried to blame us even though we had the supporting documentation, and then they had it set up with only one kids bed. After sorting the rooms we then had to wait an hour for our driver to arrive (even though I had booked him from 3pm-6pm) so here we are in Colombo, wasting our 3 hour site-seeing window because the hotel was useless. Then instead of being honest, they constantly told us that the driver is ""here immediately"" which was an outright lie because it was an hour wait, with 2 toddlers in the heat whilst missing our opportunity to explore the city. This was extremely frustrating, because if they had been honest about the delay we would have taken a taxi and enjoyed our time in Colombo. Finally a driver arrived, and having explored Colombo with a reduced amount of time because of the hotels delay, we arrive back to find out the hotel had no hot water. Amazing. Unbelievable that we could be paying top dollar for such a terrible experience. Finally they had the audacity to charge us for the 3 hours driver time, even though they had wasted half of that by running late. Do not stay there.

We so enjoyed our stay here in 2013 - that's why we returned for a 3-night stay, so looking forward to enjoying what we remembered of the hotel with our friend, who was visiting Sri Lanka for the very first time. Never again. My partner and I were put to the inconvenience of moving from a suite to a much less pleasant room on the second day - no hot water! Our friend's suite was a bit of a mess - non-functional bulbs, no lights in the bathroom, a wardrobe door handle falling off. But she gritted her teeth and bore it until the final night when her room was pulsating from the din of a late-night Christmas function in the pool area and she had to be evacuated to another room in her bath robe through a crowd of guests. Meanwhile in our new room we scolded our fingers on burning water (the choice was cold or burning). 

The whole hotel has already seen better days since 2013 - scuffed, stained paintwork, upholstery crying out for refreshment etc etc. And something's certaiinly not working somewhere - staff-wise it was like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.

What really irked us was the 'function' issue. It's not the Cinnamon Grand with large banqueting suites etc - it's a medium-sized boutique hotel and any party just takes over - not only noise-wise - but the Cloud Café rooftop bar and (in the evenings) the poolside area were out of bounds to us for our whole stay. We felt totally marginalised.

Also (on the subject of left hand and right hand apparently being attached to separate bodies) it was a good job we settled our bill the night before our early-morning start for the airport. They set a record. It took more than half an hour!

We so look forward to future return trips to Colombo - but we won't ever stay here again.

However, it was a disappointment.

First, we had corresponded with the hotel to arrange for free airport pickup.  Response was slow in coming, but we did eventually get the information.  Upon landing, someone was supposed to meet us with a sign, but no one was there.  A nice guard called the hotel for us, as we had no cell service.  The driver eventually showed up and we were taken to the hotel.

At check in, I asked if the room had the bed arrangements we had requested and was told yes.  We opened the door to see that the room did not have the bedding we had reserved.  So we went back down to the counter and waited while they worked this out (we were tired after a late fight and really just wanted to sleep).  The second room, thankfully, was the one we had reserved.

In the morning, we walked into the breakfast room and sat down.  Our place mats were covered in stains, and mine had two knives instead of the usual fork, knife spoon.  The lack of cleanliness was really a turn off, and I was happy we were staying only one night.

This was just a sad hotel much in need of a facelift and some customer service training that I would have expected Ramada to provide.

The pros are few in number: the property is near to the airport, it seems to have a shuttle bus to the airport (we didn’t use it - made our own arrangements), the staff are nice and the kitchen makes a very competent Sri Lankan curry. 

But the rooms are dated and faded, and we had a problem with the air conditioner which had a bad leakage issue which required a change of room. Credit where credit is due: the team eventually shifted our room to another one nearby and they had quite full occupancy so this was not an easy fix. This was kind of them and in fact the staff as mentioned were very good in general. However the air conditioner in the changed room, whilst it didn’t drip, didn’t actually work and the room was roasting. Not what you want the night before a flight, which I suspect is what most people choose the Ramada for. 

The rooms feel in need of a deep clean, the halls are (to be frank) rather musty and it’s a bit of a rabbit warren, with long halls to walk down with luggage (there is only one lift). It’s quite dark and dingy throughout. Breakfast is unremarkable at best. Some bathrooms have a pronounced and dangerous tile lip where the door meets the hallway which we stubbed our toes on (as in, we ALL did) and needed to put a towel on it to de-risk things! 

Last and important point: the wifi is patchy as hell (didn’t work for most of the stay) and when it did work the bandwidth was poor. I imagine a number of people rely on the wifi just before a flight to load up on downloaded Netflix or Prime Video content and the Ramada Katunayake will be of virtually zero utility in this regard. They also give you internet passes per device to manually cap the devices you can use, which is a blaringly loud warning sign that the internet facilities do not pass muster.

Choose another place, I think we were considering a Taj property nearby and maybe that would have been a better option.

Pros - airport pickup was good
They put baby bed when asked for.

Cons
1. I requested them for better pricing of room over email before booking as we were to be there only for 6-7 hours. They gave me a good price initially but when I was about to book said that price will be higher as I need the room in morning hours.

2. It is 7.5 KMS away from the airport and not 300 m.

3. They charged us 12 dollars for pickup.

4. When we reached at 3:30 am they asked us to make immidiate payment for room. We said we'll do that in the morning as we were exhausted but they weren't kind enough.

5. Breakfast was very sad with v v limited choices and they charged us for it at check out while we had requested for a discounted rate for room and breakfast. 

6. The bed in the room was smaller than even queen size.

7. The shower knob was missing.

Don’t be fooled this is not a “Ramada” as I expected, but probably at best a 3 star with very little going for it.
- Poor location and surroundings, right on Negombo road, nothing to see outside, no beach or shops close by.
-Rooms were clean and ok, but the corridors and room was stinking hot as there is no AC left on. The room AC took about 1 hr to cool the room down. The corridors have no AC so very unpleasant.
-Tried to get some sleep in the early hours 12 am on, but the staff love talking and joking aloud in the corridors with no consideration to the guests.
-breakfast on the first stay was very average, restaurant was hot with flies hovering around.
-Some staff were quite ok and welcoming, some needed training in how to deal with guests.

My second stay (again approx 20 hrs) was slightly better because I apparently got a deluxe room ...but everything else was very similar.

It’s disgraceful that Sri Lankan airways use such low standard hotels for their business class guests in particular.. it will certainly make me think twice of transiting through Colombo on SL airlines if this is their transit accomodation choice for customers.

This hotel really has nothing appealing other than a uncomfortable place to rest whilst transiting for half a day or so.","The shorter the stay the better","2019-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1500185-d1514317-r652594186-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Katunayake_Colombo_International_Airport-Katunayake_Negombo_W.html",

""Nie wieder"" indeed. Regrettably we have had to ban Mr Bechtle from Suite Lanka for life. Not that he will want to visit again. We have many important points to make in response to his comments.
Mr Bechtle's booking was for 1 person, yet he arrived at the hotel with a younger woman who was unable to provide a passport and failed to provide any ID. This is against Sri Lanka regulations, but when this was raised Mr Bechtle became abusive.
Management received several complaints that Mr Bechtle was seen naked on his terrace early the next morning. We do not practice Freikörperkultur at Suite Lanka.
Mr Bechtle paid a heavily discounted price on our cheapest room, demanded an upgrade and then became abusive when he was told this was not possible.
Mr Bechtle insisted on sleeping with his door open at night. When management warned him  that this was a security risk, he again became abusive. Our night security is caring and dutiful and therefore had to spend much of the time keeping a quiet yet diligent eye on his room. This is not ""neurotic"" behaviour. It is perhaps inadvisable - ironic even - for Mr Bechtle to make such a charge!
Narigama Beach is one of the most famously broad and sandy beaches in Sri Lanka. We carry many photos of it on TripAdvisor. It is a shame that Mr Bechtle feels it is boring and would like it to be a different shape.
We warn all our guests about the possibility of strong sea currents, especially if the weather is poor or if it is outside high season. Sri Lankan seas are dangerous and Mr Bechtle is a man whose best years are behind him. He would have been informed earlier, and advised of the best places to swim, but at the time we were still sorting out his many complaints. The choice where he swims is his alone.
The room size is accurate. The site on which Mr Bechtle booked calculates room size including bathroom and terrace.
The a/c and toilet were checked before and after Mr Bechtle's arrival and they were functioning perfectly well. It is true that we intend to upgrade the bathroom in this room in May 2025 - the next stage in a series of upgrades in the past few years.
It appears from another 1-star review that Mr Bechtle also did not like the food (he forgot to mention this ). We realised this when he was on the point of leaving the hotel without paying for the food eaten either by himself or his lady companion.
Suite Lanka is committed to learning from guest comments, takes many critical points seriously, and uses the knowledge gained to try to improve our service.
During Mr Bechtle's brief stay we had a hotel full of happy and fulfilled guests as our other reviews underline.
But on Mr Bechtle, we have only one further thing to say: ""Nie wieder!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"868 Galle Rd Thiranagama, Hikkaduwa 80240 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80240",,"868 Galle Rd","Thiranagama","1181608","6.120059","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.115715","Suite Lanka","302","4.6","6","7","16","40","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d1181608-Reviews-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://suitelanka.com","2024-12-07","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ich hatte leider keine gute Erfahrung in diesem Hotel.

first of all I thank you for having chosen Suite Lanka as the place to stay on your last night of holiday.
Our first contact was your request for a rate lower than the one offered through booking.com. I offered you a very special rate. You haggled with me a couple of emails, until I gave you a very special price, which I only gave you, because  I had the impression that you were students, exploring Sri Lanka, what I had sympathy for.
When you arrived, you were assigned a room, we call ""Superior Plus"", which is the size of a Superior room (both Superior rooms were already booked), but with a bit of a higher quality furniture and equipment. It´s a full bedroom with private bathroom and terracce, with a lockable connecting door to our biggest suite (Two bedroom Suite)
You were introduced to the room as we always do it, with A/C, lights and TV switched on. Then you received your welcome drink and went to the beach. Everything seemed to be fine.
In the evening around 10pm I received a call from my manager, informing me, that your A/C was broken (remember, upon check in it was working). My staff tried to reach the maintenance person, who is generally available in case of ""emergency"" (being located at Ocean Front, we experience heavy seabreeze, especially during the months of may through november. This causes many problems with electrical items such as A/C, lights, electronics). Unfortunately he couldn´t come that late anymore, because he was in Matara at that time (60 km away).
As obviously the AC was required (every room has a strong ceiling fan over the bed as well), we decided to open the connecting door to the Two Bedroom Suite for you. So you didn´t even have to move your things, but only change the bedrooms. Now you had two bedrooms plus a living room ... and 2 functional AC systems. That´s what you called ""faffing"".
When I greeted you during breakfast, I was not sarcastic at all, but apologized for the broken AC and I was sure, that you were more than happy for how the problem has been solved.
But instead you started instantly to complain, that we should have checked the AC, before checking you in and even asked for a financial compensation. I then realized that obviously you must have been very unhappy about much more incidents, probably throughout your vacation and I left you alone. 
I am sorry, that you didn´t enjoy your stay with us and I wish you a happy winter back in UK.
With kind regards, Roland

first of all I thank you for letting us be a part of your anniversary trip and explicit praising our rooms, restaurant, staff and location. We are constantly working on mantaining a high standard to satisfy all our guests. However sometimes things can go wrong. And even as we are constantly cleaning all areas of the hotel, areas like the parking, which is open and can be accessed by outsiders, can be watched 24/7. Before you arrived, obviously somebody must have thrown a plastic bottle or so on our ground and we didn´t see that before your arrival. I apologize for that.
Your next complain referred to the way we receive our guests. Actually we don´t do the classical check in procedure, but accompany our guests straight to their rooms to have their welcome drink on their terracce while watching the sea instead of standing in front of the reception desk. Our welcome drinks are always fresh fruit juices, never from a can or made out of  powder. 
Regarding the breakfast I need to comment that we can arrange Hoppers only when ordering the day before, what you did. The reason is, that we do not produce them ourself and they can not be bought in a shop, but have to be produced fresh. Rottis are not offered by us (and they are not in our menue), as it´s a street food and definetely can be produced better in the respective snackbars. But it doesn´t mean that you had to order the same food, as we have a wide selection of breakfast items. Even if you both had Srilankan breakfast, I don´t understand the problem occuring regarding you being vegetarian. As you know the srilankan breakfast consists of different curries and it wouldn´t have been a problem to serve you a vegetarian curry while your husband enjoys his favorite kind of meat. 
In general I have the impression that you enjoyed your stay with us and I hope we can welcome you again at another occasion in the future. And if you pre-advise us about your visit, I will personally make sure, that you will have rottis at your breakfast table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"868 Galle Rd Thiranagama, Hikkaduwa 80240 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80240",,"868 Galle Rd","Thiranagama","1181608","6.120059","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.115715","Suite Lanka","302","4.6","6","7","16","40","233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d1181608-Reviews-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://suitelanka.com","2014-04-01","OTHER","2",,"Value","1","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","4","Service","3","Sleep Quality","4","We stayed here as part of a few days away for our anniversary in February and although the hotel (rooms, restaurant, staff, and location) are very nice, it is ridiculously overpriced for what it is and there are far better places to stay in Sri Lanka, (and Hikkaduwa) for a lot less.  Basically I would have loved the hotel if we had paid about 12,000 rupees bed and breakfast, but it was nearly double that and the rooms, food and service do not live up to the expectations that that price puts on them.  

To start with the (small) car park at the entrance to the hotel has some litter in it, then when we rang the bell and walked in it was as if they were not expecting us at all and there was no particular welcome or checking-in experience.  A welcome drink was however brought up to our balcony though, which we left for about 10 minutes whilst we unpacked and when we came back found that it had separated into half sugar syrup and half juice.  Breakfast was nice, we went for the Sri Lankan breakfast option, however the evening before (when we pre-ordered) one of us asked for rotti and the other for hoppers, and we were told we both had to have the same.  This would not be a big deal in a guest house at all, however when paying over one hundred pounds (including taxes) for bed and breakfast, I expect to be able to have what I want from the menu and not be confined to what my husband wants! - especially as he is a meat-eater and I am a vegetarian.  Finally, the pool is in a very unfortunate location, surrounded by high walls and near the kitchen so staff walking past constantly.  As a result is seems that it is rarely used.  

Anyway, these are not huge gripes, and I would not complain at all about these sorts of issues in a guest house.  However this is not marketed or priced as a guest house, so I expect a lot more. And moreover, in Sri Lanka, for that price, it is possible to find a lot more.","Terribly Overpriced","2014-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r199488239-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

thank you very much for taking the effort to write a comment about your stay at our Suite Lanka.

I am sorry to hear, that you obviously didn´t enjoy your stay with us. 
Regarding the rates you have mentioned, I am absolutely surprised. As you obviously stayed at the same category as your friend did, it was most probably a Superior room. The rate last year was indeed around USD 77 (plus tax & service charges).  At the moment we are charging for that room EUR 86 (inclusive of tax & service charge and breakfast for two). In Peak Season (christmas and new year) we are charging EUR 108,-. This is the absolute maximum we have always charged for that room. This can be verified by having a look in our pricelist (please refer to  www.suitelanka.com.). 
There are higher room categories however, for example the Two-Bedroom Suite at a size of 112 sqm, which we charge EUR 196 at the moment, inclusive of tax, service charge and breakfast. 
But I assume that you didn´t compare the rate of the entrance category with the rate of the biggest available suite.

However I am happy to inform you, that we have just recently completed a huge renovation of many parts of the hotel. Among them are the Superior and Deluxe rooms and their bathrooms, the restaurant, bar and poolside as well as all public areas, such as pathways, public bathrooms etc.  You may get a very good impression by having a look at our new virtual tour, which you can find on our website.
    
I hope, you will give us the chance again to prove to you that your next stay with us will be worth every single cent you are paying. If you are considering coming, please let me know in advance and I will personally make sure that you will have a great time.

We stayed here based on a friend's recommendation who loved it.  We were extremely disappointed with the property overall. Upon return we discovered that they had paid $77 per night whereas we paid in excess of $220 per night.

At $77 this property is just about acceptable.  It is really not worth anything more than that.

The pool at this property is completely useless - located behind the hotel between the hotel block and the kitchens with no view whatsoever and stagnant air.  Who needs a pool when the ocean is that beautiful? Yes, I agree - however you are paying a premium for a property with a pool.

The rooms do not have TV, phones, or any of the amenities one would expect for such a high price. The rooms are very spacious - but necessarily so - they are not nice at all and you really wouldn't want to spend any time in them with their dated furniture and dark interiors.

The location is about a 10+ minute walk down the beach to any of the popular bars and restaurants. This does not offer you much more privacy than the rest of the beach - we would have preferred to be closer to the restaurants.  There are no loud nightclubs and such on this strip where staying away would be a benefit.

The only explanation to the mixed reviews one finds on here is the price paid. If we had paid $77 we might have found this place just acceptable (not more). However at $200+ I would look elsewhere.

We spent 2 nights in Aditiya at more than double the rate (>$400 per night) and felt that was worth every penny - I have reviewed that property too.","HIGHLY OVERRATED!

Unfortunately this evening one airconditioning system broke down. The manager arranged some technical help and the next morning the system had been repaired. 
Again I am terribly sorry for that. However having the privilege of being at this stunning location, we are facing major problems with all technical equipment, caused by the seabreeze, specially during monsoon season. We are trying our outmost to prevent impact to our guests well being and I am sorry, if we have failed in your case.

As during your brief stay I have always talked to your travel agent by phone and  never to you. 
I am therefore surprised that you call me a rude man without even knowing me.
As well I like to clarify that the confirmation for the refund to you has been made already while talking to your travel agent. I will recheck with them who is the ""greedy little man"" you are mentioning in your comment.
 
Finally I would like to inform you that we have closed down the hotel in may and june 2012 for a huge renovation. Please see the result at www.suitelanka.com/tour
If you wish to make your own personal experience, please let me know when you are intending to visit again and I will make sure that you will have a great stay.

Visit as 2 couples in 2011. Its filthy. Its small. Its creepy, dark and dingy.The rooms are big, but furnishings from the 60's. The bathrooms need an overhaul. The shower had a trickle, and no hot water. The towels were the crappiest towels we had ever used, the water didn't try! It was ridiculous. Its locked up at night and there's one inept old man guard who can't speak english. There's no phone in the rooms. Only a bell, which we rung 10 times before the guard came. Our A/C leaked and flooded the room..it was hot and humid, plus there was a river in the room. We called our travel agency and said we wanted out of there. The owner, who was an extremely rude man sitting in Europe refused to believe us and refund our money. At that point we didn't care, we just wanted to get out. There were only two people present the next morning, they apologized but laughed at our awful sleepless night - we paid for the one night and got out of there asap. Our travel agency negotiated with them and got the money refunded but not before the greedy little man took some for himself. Spend some of it on your hotel and maybe people wouldn't have such an awful time. I can't believe the reviews on this hotel it should be listed as the worst hotel in the world. @ $80 a night to be paid in advance, its total crap.

We were really excited to be staying there as we thought it was going to be de luxe (considering the price!).

We had a room on ground level facing onto the beach. It was incredibly beautiful. Unfortunately, the room was not worth what they were charging for it. Everything was a bit run-down. The door locks had been eroded so much by the salty air that I got locked into the bathroom and management had to break open the door with a crowbar. The door was left broken for the remaining 3 days of our stay! The lights didn't work properly and in the evenings we found ourselves stumbling around in the darkness of our room rather frequently (and it wasn't due to power outages, just faulty electrics).

The staff were alright but mentioned a couple of times to 'give them a good review' which really irritated me because a) the hotel wasn't really up to scratch (especially after being stuck in the bathroom for ages) and b) it's up to me what type of review I decide to leave and it depends completely on my experience.

The best part about the hotel was the restaurant. The food was pretty delicious and definitely something I remember most fondly about the hotel. 

I will also say that while the beach is pretty nice, I personally found the beach in Unawatuna much better for amenities and the sea was much calmer for swimming. Also, I stayed in a nicer hotel for far cheaper!","Not worth the money","2011-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r124950896-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Neither am I the kind of person who finds it necessary to write a negative review because I found an ant on my pillow.  However as a trustworthy individual who has stayed at many hotels over the years, and several in Sri Lanka as of the time of this review, I can tell you... or rather warn you, this hotels is absolutely and completely overpriced!

This, I would assume, is the consequence of an owner who has delusions of grandeur, but deluded he is.  Even if you manage to find a good on-line rate ($157), it is still rather expensive for Sri-Lanka, but once you add the tax and service charge, it comes to around $200 a night.  Now, let me tell you, that for less that this, you can sit in the lap of luxury... right in it's lap.

Now, the hotel isn't terrible...  It was fairly clean, and yes, the balcony are big, and yes, the location is ok.  But these factors do not make a great hotel.  

It has a family run feeling, and the people are nice and they do their work well enough.  But the whole hotel wreaks of management desperate to make money and cut corners at every opportunity.  Old towels, no toiletries of in room refreshments such as coffee etc.  A milky white pool, a breakfast that can be described as such. Coffee. 1 Ring of pineapple, a slice of papaya, a juice, and 2 eggs prepared any of 3 ways.  Not to mention wild dogs who seemed to like the company of the hotel guests during breakfast.

We are also constantly reminded to keep the doors locked at all times, especially at night, something to give any traveller piece of mind.

All fine, but like I say, for $200 a night in Sri Lanka, this is a crazy joke and is clearly the result of a greedy management. 

May I recommend this... buy nice new towels, new fridges, some nice toiletries, a new filtration system for your pool, fix the doors, get some better locks on the doors, give better value drinks and food, clean the windows more !!! change the bar and entrance areas to be more inviting. Buy new uniforms. put a small fence to keep the dogs out... and then lower your price slightly, instead of investing all you money in to web site design that does not reflect the ambiance of the hotel at all.

As it stands, I will tell everybody who read this review, that for $200 do not consider this to be a wise choice for your money in any way.  Currently it is a bare bones, slightly tired base, with a nice looking frontage, that is pretending to be something it's not, with some fairly nice staff.","I would question the other recent reviews for this hotel.","2011-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r121726630-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Security man would come when he wanted,some nights no security even though they tell you its not safe to leave anything out or leave your windows open.....And many guests have had things stolen from there rooms.(cost of security man per night was 200rps £1.20p or $1.50 !!!!!)
Wanted paying in cash as he didn't want to put the money through the books as his German boss was in germany and would not know about the £600 given to him for my stay.(11 months wages for one of his staff) 
I feel sorry for the owner as he's being ripped off every day by this guy.
The prices for the rooms are way to high,you can walk down the beach and find 20 more places to stay for less and have all the services.
Charged you for complementary water after the 2days,as the bottles of complementary had ran out so you have to buy the water from him(crazy crazy)
Decided to add to the Mini bar bill 11 bottles of coke and i don't drink coke....
THIEFS!!!!
The only positive thing i can say about the place is the garden are nice and the chef is a great guy and friendly,funny and can cook well.....
Avoid this place if you can as at the beginning it all looks and feels good but a couple of days in you will start to notice all the bad things.","idiots","2008-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r24466992-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I am sorry the property did not meet your expectations but I do hope your refund at least went some way to curbing your disappointment. It is unusual for us to have this type of commentary and some of these comments are new and surprising to us. We will look into them and see what we can improve.
In the meantime, I wish you well and trust the rest of your trip was successful.

The rooms are stunning and the finishing touches are all to a very high standard so no complains there at all. It's also quite remote and private which is also something that appealed to me very much. 

What I found very disappointing was the food choice and quantity provided. For dinner I had a choice between a fish dish or a pork dish and dessert was either a trifle or fresh fruit! We ordered one of each and all I got was one meagre thin half slice of fish with a teaspoon sized dollop of mash. Mum got one small pork chop. I ordered the fresh fruit and all I got was half a banana, one triangle of watermelon and 2 half slices of pineapple! A joke considering the rate per night is nearly USD 300!! 

I ordered a carbonara separately for my 3 year old and was extremely surprised to receive something that didn't remotely resemble or taste like carbonara. My daughter didn't touch it. Any chef knowing his onions knows how to make a carbonara. 

Breakfast was also sadly another disappointment where I got one slice of bacon, I small sausage and 2 poached eggs. They don't even bake their own bread freshly. It was just bog standard shop bought sliced bread. No variety in anything whatsoever. 

Overall I won't be in a hurry to visit again. I understand the concept of fine dining but that is not the time or place for it. When we spend money on exotic holidays, food plays a great part in the overall experience. I wouldn't recommend this hotel purely because the money spent is just not worth the experience.
