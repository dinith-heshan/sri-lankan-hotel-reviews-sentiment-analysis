On the down side: the tents are not (as we expected) the wilderness but on the outskirts of town. Civilization in the form of club music could be heard well into the night - not a true wilderness experience as we had at other places outside Sri Lanka. Also, the accomodation is a bit worn and used - the tents could do with a renovation, the mosquito nets at the windows are torn, it is impossible to get natural light into the tent during daytime.

When we called to make the reservation, we clearly asked Mr. Deen (the manager at Long Feng) several times whether our vouchers and promotions would be valid for the “All You Can Eat Dim Sum.” He confirmed multiple times over the phone that they were valid. Based on his confirmation we proceeded to make our reservation and visit the restaurant.
However, after our meal, we were informed that the vouchers were in fact not applicable. This directly contradicts everything Mr. Deen told us earlier. This is not just a simple mistake — it’s a complete failure in communication and accountability on the part of someone who is supposed to be in a position of responsibility. If he wasn’t 100% sure, the bare minimum he should have done was to double-check before giving us a definite answer. Instead, he gave us false information with complete confidence, which led to an embarrassing and frustrating situation for us as customers.
Frankly, it’s unacceptable for a manager at a five-star hotel to behave in such an incompetent and careless manner. Guests rely on your managers to provide correct details about promotions etc. 
I sincerely hope you take this seriously and ensure that issues like this are addressed — both in terms of accountability for Mr. Deen’s actions, and making sure such miscommunication doesn’t happen to other guests. This kind of service is simply not acceptable from a hotel of your reputation.","Misinformation from Long Feng manager Mr.Deen","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r1010952153-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Also, the staff at the restaurant needs to be trained on when NOT to remove the food from the table! I stayed only for a day, and had only one breakfast at the hotel. My food (a lot of it I still hadn't started eating fully) was on the table and I stepped away for probably 2 minutes to grab a glass of water. When I came back, all the food had been removed! When I asked the staff why they removed mostly untouched food in such a short time, they were clueless and didn't bother to help. Again, no one bothered to ask what I was eating and if they should get me the food again. Food is an important aspect when travelling on a hectic schedule and even though they had a great variety of food, the whole experience was marred because of the restaurant staff. I found the staff in general to be unwilling to help or go the extra mile to make guests feel welcome. The rooms are fine for the price and the location is great too.

The hotel’s location is excellent, and the pool and lake next to it were great. Our room (250) had a street view, which wasn’t bad. The room had a bathtub, and they provided one 1.5-liter bottle of drinking water daily, along with Nescafe, tea, sugar, and a special sweetener for diabetics, all for free. The safe in our room was broken, and while they offered to replace it, we preferred to have it fixed after we left.
The hotel was very busy, with large groups of tourists constantly entering and leaving the lobby, which was always crowded. The breakfast area was also very crowded, and we had to wait for a table to free up. The privacy for families wasn’t well-maintained, and there wasn’t enough tranquility. The variety of breakfast options was acceptable, though. It seemed that the hotel staff, due to the high number of guests, were exhausted, and their interactions felt more formal than friendly.
Overall, the hotel didn’t seem very family- or child-friendly.

The hotel is large, modern, well appointed. Comfortable bedrooms, ample choice at breakfast (which can get busy). Our room had a Lakeside view, pretty enough, but it also overlooked the poolside bar/club which had loud music playing till the very early hours, rendering sleep a challenge. I would recommend checking this, before you book, or stay on the other side of the hotel.

However, what soured our stay was that the day after we checked in at the hotel, we were victims of a scam.

As we left the hotel to walk to the local temple in the morning (still jet lagged), a man claiming to be a hotel employee started a conversation with us. He claimed his name was Sangha Perera. He appeared to be helpful, giving us directions. As it was raining, he advised us that taking a tuk tuk around the main tourist attractions would be easier and cheaper. As he was connected to the hotel, we trusted him. He 'found' us a tuktuk, and even joined us acting as an unnoficial guide. Eventually he ended up taking us to an 'officially credited' government approved jewellery shop, which had 50% off,  he even told us a percentage of profits would be donated to tsunami orphans. We were pressurised by the shop management (all men) into purchasing items.  After that the tuktuk driver told us the ride for 2.5 hours would cost equivalent of £100 in rupees, and things got very heated until we paid up.

We reported the matter to the Jeevani Perera, Lobby Manager at Colombo Cinnamon Lakeside hotel. She told us the man did not work at the hotel, and an identical incident had happened previously. We also spoke to the hotel security officer, who said he would check hotel security videos. Later we even sent them photos of the man claiming to be an hotel employee and the tuktuk driver. We were disappointed to receive no response from them.

BE WARNED if you stay at this hotel. Scammers are working around there, and the hotel seemingly turns a blind eye, without advising guests checking in! (SEE PHOTOS OF SCAMMERS ATTACHED). Am sure the same thing goes on outside other hotels too...

We eventually went to the local police, who were helpful, and they went with us to get our money back from the jewellery shop (Lanka Sapphire Lapidary PVT Ltd., no 83 Dharmaphala Mawatha, Colombo 07), but it was not easy to do so.

No warm welcome, just a 'put your baggages through the scanner', no cool towels or cool drink until we complained. Our receptionist was non communicative, just staring at his computer for 10 minutes before I demanded to speak to a manager who asked me what was wrong! I explained the whole experience was akin to going through an airport. A soul-less place, lacking atmosphere. Was meant to stay 4 nights but fortunately we escaped after just a 1 night stay, never again. Then it took 35 minutes to check out even though we had no bill to pay and it was quiet! 4 baggage staff were all standing around whilst we sat waiting for our bags. Once again I complained to a manager who again asked what was wrong and kept saying sorry, sorry and not really understanding what I was trying to tell him. 5 Star, no way, Sri Lankan hospitality at it's worst!!

I believe most of the rooms are crying out for an update. From lighting, to bedding, to carpets to everything else. Do not feel like a five star hotel once in the room. Also, someone needs to do a thorough quality check on all rooms.

However, you cannot falter the staff, most hospitable, and Cinnamon brand is renowned for this. The biggest reason why I keep returning to their hotels. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough to bring me back to Cinnamon Lakeside though.

The Book Direct discounts and facilities that are promised if you book directly from Cinnamon website is a farce. It takes forever to get at least some of them. You won’t get them automatically, and  we had to keep asking for them all the time. Just save your time. 
But it isn’t good practice to promise benefits that the hotel is reluctant to honour.","You can be lucky!","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r989467187-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

We do generally get compliments about the decor and bathroom for your room which is particularly popular.I think it is important to clarify a response to your comment that the bathroom is “out at the back” and “not totally private”.From the main bedroom is a door to the bathroom under roof cover  half-open to a very small courtyard between it and the bedroom ( not an unusual feature in warmer climates where indoor/outdoor is common)  - the distance from the bedroom to bathroom is about 5m so not  “secluded” at all ....and importantly it is totally private

Rooms are cosy and decorated well if a little tired looking in places, and the toilet and shower are outside at the back, in a secluded spot. Just be aware! You don’t share with other guests but it’s not totally private. The rooms also let in a lot of noise from outside as they’re not totally cocooned away from the courtyard. 

The breakfast had a lot of choice, and was all delicious but was a little late in terms of timeliness. There were only two rooms occupied so I imagine if it was busier it would be more chaotic. There’s also no soya milk available so not perfect for us lactose intolerant guests. The hotel also doesn’t have a liquor licence.

We had different experiences both times and not consistent.  The hotel itself is too far from the airport to be used as an airport hotel.  Also quite far from Colombo in comparison to other Negombo hotels.  Our first stay was nice despite having a bad experience during check in when the young reception guy kept asking me to pay the balance during check in.  We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and didn’t want to miss dinner.  It was already about 8 pm.  This guy was so unprofessional and impatient so first impression was very bad.  Both dinner and breakfast were fabulous.  The room was very comfortable and it was a great stay.  The second time the air condition in the room didn’t work, meals were not great and the standard has drastically dropped.  We were very disappointed.  For the price paid no A/C in the room and the weather was extremely hot.  We were contemplating on the distance from the airport and whether we will visit again but the overall experience on our second stay really disappointed us.  They tried many times to repair the a/c wasting our time spent in the room and privacy.  We had to keep leaving the room many times.  However they still charged us for the late check out.  This should have been free.  They tried to give a different room still it was taking a long time to cool after being closed without a/c.  The hotel was not particularly busy but staff are not experienced to deal with problems which is a worry.  Agree with other reviews, not maintained the beautiful property which is a shame.

Every property has its own Pros, Cons & Areas of improvement. Let me start with the positives:

1)	Staffs – All the staffs are very welcoming, Polite, Smiling and go over & beyond to fulfill your requests
2)	We stayed in the Villas, the best decision we took. Wonderful and spacious rooms, Huge toilets with big bathtubs and my personal favorite is the “Rain Shower”
3)	Villas has a garden and Plunge Pool. When it was raining and pool was crowded, we used the plunge pool. It was good time to spend with family in the plunge pool
4)	There was a balcony in the 1st Floor, overseeing the Ocean with a swing in it. Every morning we had a great time in the Swing overseeing the Ocean with our cup of coffee
5)	Swimming Pool Lifeguard was really good. Whenever he was available, he made sure we had our towels and have been taken care of. He was proactive in his job
6)	Poolside service was great. We had ordered lot of Food & Drinks for the poolside and also to our plunge pool in our Villa, everything was taken care by butlers with great care
7)	Kids Water Park – There was a water park inside the resort and my daughter had lot of fun in the park. There are timeslots for it between 9.30 AM – 11.00 AM & 3.00 PM – 5.00 PM
8)	We went to this property to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Resort people and staff put up a great effort to set up a candle light dinner by the sea and also went one step ahead to decorate our bedroom and give us a complimentary cake.  But all went in vain when rain interrupted our dinner(We felt bad as the team put a lot of effort into this) Thank you people for making our day extra special

Cons/ Things I didn’t Like:

1)	Although they assign you a personal butler (As they say) for the Villa rooms, they are not available throughout the stay. Most of the times we had to call the restaurant and order food which is fine by me. But before that we kept calling the butler and he came with the menu after 30-45 minutes. When we called the mobile number provided by the butler, the call went to the Reception. If they are going to provide a personal butler as they say, there must be an easy way to reach him
2)	We ordered A-La-Carte all the time. When we asked if there are any set menu or other options for the Lunch/Dinner to the receptionist, we were said that the Butler would give us the menu and let me know the pricing. But Butler didn’t know the prices as he wasn’t sure. So, we just went ahead with A-La-Carte for our whole trip
3)	Most of the staffs doesn’t know English or was unable to understand English. With lot of international guests, the staffs should know English is my opinion. At least they should be able to understand English is my opinion
4)	On Saturday morning, there were around 5 gentleman who started to drink and smoke around morning 7 AM. They didn’t rent room and they were just there to utilize the pool and drinks by the Pool which is ok. But smoking by the pool and passing comments on girls passing by didn’t go well. There were around 4-5 families with kids who came to enjoy the weekend, but because of these guys, nobody turned up to the pool. There was a kid pool nearby and smoking there doesn’t seem fair to me. It was lot of inconvenience to all the people around. Tried to complain to the resort manager and he said they would be there only till 1 PM and the would leave which made me more uncomfortable. As they were getting money from the drinks these guys have, resort didn’t take any step towards our complaint
5)	Worst part is when they came out of the pool and they wanted a sunshade. So, they moved their tables nearby to our Villa (No 1) and our villa didn’t feel private any more as these peeps were looking around our Villa and it made us uncomfortable. So, we had to move in and wait till those guys went out as we didn’t want any issues. If the resort people themselves cannot do or tell anything to these guys, what are we supposed to do? Manager whom I spoke to was not really helpful
6)	Although the resort rooms are good and maintained, the outer part of the resorts are not up to the mark. They need an upgrade as soon as possible
7)	There were lot of spider webs inside the restaurant walls. Not sure if they clean them only once a week in the weekends when many people turn out to the resort for the weekend

All being said, I would strongly suggest you to take “Villa Rooms” if it fits your budget and want spacious rooms

Will it visit again and refer this property to my friends?

I don’t think so. Those 5 gentlemen who made lot of trouble changed my opinion about this property and what the resort people stand for. They keen on making money than the risk involved with these kinds of guests. If they had taken some sort of action against them or even if they had just asked to go and smoke elsewhere, I would have been happy. But end of the day money wins over any other things which I strongly don’t agree that too being in a hospitality industry

Good things first: Our kids (3 and 6) loved the water slides and the kids pool. To me this looked all a bit dated but they did not care. The beach is also quite nice and seemed suitable for children to swim (not common in Sri Lanka), though we did not use it. Also, the main pool seemed nice.

However, the resort is a bit dated and the room - we stayed in a duplex pool villa - seemed a bit worn. The restaurant tends to be depressing, a large space where tables are separated by walls, no music, no atmosphere. Same goes for the reception area.

The staff was very friendly and provided great breakfast boxes but were slightly inefficient. We were set up in the wrong room, told to change, then told to stay... and no one could provide any information about when to go to the airport to catch flight (you hear nightmare stories of having to be there 5-6 hours early but they are not true. 2 hours fully suffice).

Finally, I found the place seriously overpriced. I did not consider the price we paid good value for money. Next time I will look for an alternative.","Not sure about this one","2022-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499080-d15198149-r835824901-Wattura_Resort_Spa-Waikkal_Central_Province.html",

Pros: Stylish and generally well-maintained buildings and public areas. Very spacious and nicely decorated rooms with great amenities. Very friendly staff who went to great lengths in helping us celebrate my wife’s birthday. Excellent food quality in restaurant. Nice kids area with water slides, arcade etc.

Cons: Disappointing beach unfit for swimming and littered with plastic, despite plenty of idle staff who should be able to keep the beach area clean and tidy. Lots of bird droppings in and around pool, as well as in public areas. Surprisingly slow and uncoordinated service, not least in restaurant where there seems to be complete confusion among the waiters, which is s shame as the food is very good.

Thank you for your review, but you can imagine my surprise when i read that you had money stolen from your room. When you checked out of the hotel, you never mentioned anything - otherwise we would have investigated the matter immediately - and in fact you told the Duty Manager how much you had enjoyed your stay with us. So I am very perplexed, and if you did lose money whilst staying with us, of course I do apologise and am extremely sorry for this.

We do state in the welcome letter, and inform guests when shown to their room, as to where the safe is located and that we recommend that all valuables etc are kept in the safe.

Theft from a guest's room is totally unacceptable, and I am pleased to say is a very rare occurence. The majority of our staff have been here for a number of years, and I honestly do not recall the last time a guest had something stolen.

Since you said nothing when checking out, could you have lost the money after you left the hotel? Are you 100% certain that this happened whilst you were in the hotel?

I have sent you an email, asking for more details, and would appreciate your getting back to me. I need to look into this, and ensure that it does not happen again.
 
With best wishes, 

George Cooper

Thank you for your review. I am of course saddened that you felt we did not deliver, as we would like all guests to leave here with happy memories.

When you checked in, we gave both you and your friend upgrades to higher category rooms, for which there was little or no recognition - in fact the amount you were paying was equivalent to approximately 40% of the normal rate for those rooms. The fact that you then complain about the Luxury Pool Villa, saying you could not open the curtains and enjoy the natural light – with all due respect this is the bathroom only, where there is a mesh blind and a roman blind, so that you can maintain privacy whilst still letting in light.  The bedroom is not overlooked at all, so there is no reason not to open the curtains on the three French windows overlooking your private plunge pool. Your review makes it sound as if you had to keep ALL the windows closed, which is misleading and unfair.

I find your comments about the noise of dogs excessive.  We do have 3 dogs around the hotel as part of our security – and yest they do bark from time to time. Funnily enough I have recently stayed in 7 out of the 12 rooms in the hotel – in order to check that everything is as it should be – and on not one occasion was I woken up by dogs barking – and I am a light sleeper. I slept in both rooms that you and your friend stayed in.

With regards to the dogs in the Living Pavilion and Dining Pavilion. They are both “open” areas – no walls or doors - and as the hotel has been closed with no guests for the last few months due to the political and economic situation, it has been difficult to keep the three hotel dogs out of them. We are working on ensuring that this does not happen, but it takes time. 

When you voiced your complaints to me, I did offer that if you wanted to move to another hotel, that we would not charge for the nights not stayed, since I realized that we were possibly not the right hotel for you. However in you review, you make it out that this was unacceptable – I actually don’t know what else I could have done. As a hotelier, all too often guests use the threat of a bad review on trip advisor rather like the sword of Damocles, and we end up taking the criticism lying down. In this case I feel your comments are not wholly justified, but I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion. 

Yours, 
George Cooper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Habaraduwa Dikkumbura Road, Thittagalla West 80122 Sri Lanka","Thittagalla West","Sri Lanka","80122",,"Habaraduwa Dikkumbura Road",,"447364","6.019903","Thittagalla West, Galle District, Southern Province","80.34066","Kahanda Kanda","759","4.8","4","5","12","59","679","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33038157-d447364-Reviews-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://www.kkcollection.com/kahanda-kanda","2022-08-19","MOBILE","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"KK is a very original small property hotel.
12 villas (if I am correct ), each one being different in style and decoration, some with private pools some without, and positioned differently on a nice tea plantation and gardens.

Located 15mn from the coast , the property is surrounded by nature and villages, so an authentic environment.
We had booked 2 villas (one for myself and husband), one for our friend.
The two villas were closed to the main pool , restaurant, lounge area.
Ours (villa Kadju) was not as intimate as I’d hoped. Some maintenance small buildings used by the staff were located right behind our bathrooms so we had the windows curtains shut all day long and couldn’t benefit from natural day light. As well we could hear noise from the kitchen but did not bother much. 

The restaurant propose one set menu at 40USD per person. Also an A la carte menu is proposed , on request, with dishes bigger and 1/3rd of the price… but nothing between which is a bit frustrating.
The v BBC at area is nice with great choice of wine and cocktails.

Also the all team is working hard and is efficient and villa are well maintained and clean.

Our stay could have been relaxing if dogs from the villages around and from the property would not bark all night long or even wake you up at 6:00am. Being in the countryside you experience many natural noises : peacocks, monkeys, birds, cows and this was the case. However wandering barking dogs including untrained dogs on the property made it impossible to relax and ruined our stay. Also we noted dogs (3)  wandering in the lounge and restaurant area which does not match the hygiene norms nowadays in a hotel of a standing marketed to be ‘5 stars’.

I complain to the owner, Mr Cooper, who promptly replied with apologies for the inconvenience but would understand if we chose to leave as it may not be the place for us ! Reading this, considering the specific context in Sri Lanka at the moment is not acceptable especially if we consider the price level.
I would have loved our stay if we didn’t have this specific issue but at this stage as long as it remains this way, true that is definitely not for us!","Beautiful hotel with noise issues","2022-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r855002856-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I am sorry that we did not live up to your expectations, and that you found the food mediocre.  As for your comment about breakfast, I am rather surprised as there is a full breakfast menu, including pancakes, smashed avocado on test, choice of eggs, granola or muesli. fresh fruits etc etc. Normally we do set this up as a buffet, although when we only have two rooms, we give the guests the menu to choose from. 

I am not sure why you felt that the staff were not used to local guests, because since the Easter attacks, we have been offering very favourable rates to locals, of which you were one of the beneficiaries. I am not aware of other local guests feeling the same way, but will certainly talk to the staff about this.

Again, I am sorry that you were disappointed with your stay here at KK and hope that you might give us another chance at a later date, so that we can show you we do care for all our customers, wherever they come from. I would be happy to offer you both a very concessionary rate if you are interested  - pls write to me direct at george@kkcollection.com

Here are the Pros and Cons.

Pros 
Location
1. The property was lovely and vast. Peacocks at every turn and incredibly peaceful. 
2. Suite - we stayed in Dubu and it was one of the nicest suites we’ve stayed in. The Decor classic and dim, wooden floors and spacious. 
Cons 
1. Food - big disappointment. The menu was extremely limited and the nicest item we had out of it was the Caesar salad (which was a small portion) 
2. While the rest of the food was mediocre, breakfast was the worst. 2 small sausages and some egg and bacon with toast. I could do that at home eyes closed. 
I guess we felt there was no care in it all. Not sure if after the Easter attacks business suffered and as a result the they were cutting down. It strangely felt that way. 
I also felt the staff were not accustomed to locals. While they did their job from A to Z there was nothing exceptional. 
I must say however that whatever we ordered to the suite came quite fast. 
Sri Lanka has some of the best resorts / hotels in the world which are mostly patronized by locals. My husband and I have being to many beautiful resorts / villas but we wouldn’t return here. 
It wasn’t pointedly bad, but it was nothing to write home about either and that’s such a pity as you could do so much with a place like this.

Our party occupied 5 suites and consisted of 10 people.

This is a lovely property that is not too far away from the Imaduwa exit. The road leading from the turnoff point to the hotel is somewhat narrow but decent.

Hotel grounds and garden: The hotel sits on a 12 acre tea estate which is carefully landscaped to allow for a more authentic natural setting. 

The architecture and layout of the hotel has been beautifully planned out so that guests are immersed in the natural environs, albeit probably a little too immersed during sudden monsoonal showers!. The Koggala lake can be glimpsed through the trees from certain places but there really is no satisfactory view of it from any part of the hotel.

Since this is on the top of a hill, the grounds slope up and down towards the rooms which are at different levels, with jagged stone steps leading to them; not quite elderly friendly. 

Some paths were rather poorly lit at night as some of the garden lights were either not switched on, or malfunctioning.

Room: My husband and I stayed in the Araliya suite which is on the northern side of the property and has mainly a jungle/tea estate view.

Positives - the room is quite spacious and the decor is quite interesting with antique chests, brass bells and carved candlesticks which gave the room character. The bed was comfortable and big and my favourite was the bookcase filled with a variety of interesting books!

Negatives - My first concern was when I noticed a long line of black ants in the bathroom which I pointed out and they were cleared immediately. Unfortunately I later noticed more black ants emerging from a picture frame in the toilet and discovered a massive colony inhabiting the otherwise charming and well-stocked bookcase. I never quite recovered from this bad impression. 
In addition the shower had no door which meant the whole bathroom got wet. The mat next to the bathroom sink was also quite old and dirty. The walk-in closet was dusty with cobwebs on the clothes-hangers. The room smelt musty, and overall, felt like it had been hastily put together for us; this did not reflect well on their housekeeping standards. They did get rid of the ants after I complained, so that was good. 

Food: lunch was Sri Lankan style and offered as a buffet as our party consisted of 10 people. The food was very good although somewhat lacking in spice. The cocktails were overall good. My favourite meal was dinner, where my barramundi was cooked to perfection. Breakfast was pretty good too. No complaints there!

The service: the staff consists of some very lovely and friendly people - Malsha, Henry, and Amila, who seem eager to please, but unfortunately lack training and proper oversight ensuring smooth operations. The wonderful staff are let down by not having sufficient guidance from the management, which is such a pity. 

The manager of operations did pay us a visit during dinner to enquire about our experience. After I mentioned the ants and musty smell he offered a bottle of wine and skedaddled before I could bring up the other issues. 
We later approached him, sat him down and had a cordial discussion of some of the issues which he listened to patiently and on the whole took the criticism rather well.

Overall, this is a great hotel in a lovely location which is let down by deficient management and poor maintenance. This is such a pity, as it is obvious that a great deal of care and attention to detail has gone into the design of this place. I am personally disappointed that such a lovely and unique property doesn’t have the service and maintenance it deserves.","Beautiful hotel suffering from poor maintenance and management","2017-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r531612143-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I am sad that you were not happy with your stay at KK.

Clearly it is most unfortunate that the housekeeping staff left your bedroom door open - that is rather unusual, but I guess mistakes can happen.

We do offer a limited menu, because we want to ensure that the food we offer is fresh, and not all out of the freezer. I am sorry you though it was expensive - in fact we have not out our food costs up for 3 years now and other guests have commented on how reasonable we are.

At the end of the day, I know we cannot please everyone, as much as we would like to do so, and sadly you were not wowed by KK. I am sorry

As the owner, it saddens me deeply that you were not happy with your stay in the hotel.

Firstly I am sorry that you felt that the charge for the room was too much. We tried very hard to make your honeymoon as enjoyable as possible - we gave you a complimentary bottle of champagne on your first evening, and as requested, we sent all your meals down to your room. One evening there was a slight delay due to heavy rain - somewhat out of our control!

I gather there was an issue over the hot water, which as resolved very shortly after you called the office. Unfortunately electrical problems are not an uncommon issue here in Sri Lanka.

The Dubu Suite is in a garden setting, somewhat on its own, and the two bathrooms are open to the elements. With all the trees around, they do get a number of fallen leaves daily and it is not easy to keep the bathrooms looking immaculate all day long. Clearly you felt that there was a privacy issue and you did mention this to me on your second last morning, when I met you for the first time. I apologised to you and asked you when it would be convenient for you for us to make up the room and clean the garden. As a result, thereafter we telephoned you from the office each time someone was coming to the room, in order to provide you with more privacy.

Finally, there is nothing we can do about the bread van - it is a part of Sri Lankan way of life, and most guests find it rather quaint. although I do agree that it does start very early!

The staff was quite responsive to our complains but once we directly complained to the top manager who basically gave us the impression he didn't care....). Then this place and this room is supposed to be quiet or at least you expect it to be. Well unfortunately, the room is right above the road...so not only you can hear the traffic all day long but you will have the terrible surprise to also hear the music of the local baker truck who passes by every hour starting at 6am in the morning!
The hotel is a bit far from Galle (~ 45min by car considering the traffic) but it's ok it is manageable.","Even though the base is there, there are still so many details to improve to make it worth the price","2015-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r293205476-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Another disappointment was the shower, the hotel does request us to save water but it seems to be enforced on us by the terrible shower! The water pressure is minuscule and hot water takes approximately 5minutes. 

Maybe they should advertise that in case the shower doesnt work we can always shower from the AC! Beacuase ours started gushing like a waterfall.

We do not offer an extensive menu, as we only wish to offer the freshest of ingredients, and in addition, the chef usually comes in person to take the dinner order and is always happy to offer alternative dishes, if so desired. 

I cannot comment on the dishes that you were served, but I do sincerely regret that you did not enjoy your dinner. We do try to get things right, but sometimes they go awry – had you said so at the time, we would have naturally made a reduction on the bill.

I should like to point out that your bill was just over 8,000rps – approx $67.00. I would be interested to know where you think you can eat – as you claim - for $6 in Sri Lanka, other than at a roadside stall!

Our starters were okay (veggie spring rolls, and watermelon and feta salad, which I usually love but had the bizarre, unmentioned additions of olives and walnuts and bell peppers and gloopy French dressing), ourmains were overseasoned pork with mashed potato and incredibly spicy vegetables, and bland prawns with salad, and for dessert, we had very poor ice cream and – the one highlight – very good sorbet. It was the equivalent to a mid-range chain restaurant in the UK, and much more expensive - including lots of taxes and charges (unusual in SL in our experience) I think we paid nearly 10,000 rupees for three courses each, a bottle of still water and three beers between us, which was about 10 times some of the excellent meals we had in Sri Lanka.

However, had you done your homework, you would have realised that we are not about jacuzzis, plasma screens and other fancy toys. We like to offer a brief respite from all those trappings, and a chance to get back in touch with nature and the beautiful surroundings. 
You comment about room service is simply not true - there are always staff on hand to carry out your wishes, and all you have to do is ask. You do NOT have to book your cofee or tea the night before - what we do is ask if you would like some tea or cofee brought to your room in the morning, as part of a wake up call. Alternatively you may ask one of the staff in the morning, and it will be brought to your room.
The telephones are a recent upgrade, and since most guests travel with their mobile phones, it was decided that we did not need to have the facitlity of making outgoing calls. They arefor calling room service and housekeeping, should you require this. Incoming calls can be put through to your room, but it is not possible to make an outgoing call. We deemed this an unecessary feature.
As a Sri Lankan, you were given a largely discounted rate on your room, as thisappears to be common practice here in Sri Lanka - it would seem that your expectation levels exceeded your budget. 
We have taken note of your comments, and whilst I will not be buying Plasma screens or jacuzzis, improving the guest exerience is an on-going policy.

with regards to the lack of water in one bathroom, this has not happened before, but since thenwe have now installed Solar panel heating for the hot water, and this should never occur again. Water, I should point out, is a precious commodity and we do ask guests to be mindful of the water they use. Hopefully this problem will not arise.
I am very surprised at your comments that the staff were never around - they are usually very attentive to guests - as many reviews have testified to. 
Likewise, I am sorry that you did not like the Thai red Curry. I can confirm that both chefs here have been to Cookery School in Chiang Mai, and we usually hear nothing but praise for the food served.  I can only assume that the chef did not understand what you had said, as I know that he would have most definitely offered you an alternative. Sometimes things do get lost in translation!
Finally, all our tea harvest goes to a local co-operative and is made into black tea, which is
very strong! Hence we offer Dilmah tea to our guests, along with some infusions from fresh ingredients - mint, ginger and lemongrass. For your information, Liptons tea is a Sri Lankan product, as is Dilmah.  We believe in supporting local industry, in the same way that both the Galle Fort Hotel and ourselves buy our bed linen from the same supplier of local bed linen in Colombo.

My partner and I were the only guests at the property. 

Although with sporadic hot water (and strangely two shower heads which couldn't be used at the same time), the room was superb- spacious and overlooking the tea plantations, with several lounges to laze on throughout the day, and if you keep all the shutters open at night, wake to the sounds of birds in the morning. The grounds are well cared for and there is a gorgeous big pool for cooling off during the day. The big highlight, however, was the deliciously soft sheets- which I also slept under at the Galle Fort Hotel- who pinched whose idea?

My qualm was with the service, and more importantly- the food.

Despite being the only guests in the property, we literally had to track down any staff for food or drinks requests (they were usually found drinking tea and gossiping in the kitchen). Then, only a few of them were competent enough with English and hospitality skills to come through with the goods. However, those star staff who did manage to pull a few hours while we were there were fantastic.

The food is however, very hit and miss. One day we had a superb lunch of tomato soup with salad and fresh foccacia bread, the bread still warm from the oven, the soup perfectly spiced and loaded with fresh herbs. But the concoction labeled a Thai red curry for dinner was simply inedible. I lived in Thailand for several years and while I have had some very dubious ""Thai food"" around the world, this one took the cake. I'm sure an entire bottle of fish sauce had been emptied onto the prawns, which must have died gagging from the stench. To add salt to the wound, we were told that the ""chef"" had been specially sent to Chiang Mai to ""learn how to cook Thai food"". And, when I finally tracked down a staff member and tell them eating this curry was like sticking your nose in a bubbling broth of  pla-daek, the chef came out and glared at us as if he was the one whose sensibilities had been offended!  We weren't offered a replacement and hence ended up sharing one meal and going to bed mildly hungry.... The waiter was sympathetic though- maybe he had tried the curry too!

And finally, a question- if we are staying on a tea plantation in one of the biggest tea producing nations on earth, why are we made to drink Liptons?","beautiful setting- pitty about the food","2008-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038157-d447364-r24649108-Kahanda_Kanda-Thittagalla_West_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Business point of view:
There was no room fridge to cool your drinks or medications if you have any.
Simple basic meals took 40 minutes to prepare, which I thought was a bit long given one night there was only four guests and the second night there was six guests.
Our room was not serviced on one of our days, no big deal, but this is standard stuff.
On the day it was serviced the bathroom ammenities weren't replaced i.e. Soap, toothbrush and razor.
The building echoes any doors opening and closing and they can be loud, but sleep quality is good and we couldn't hear the other guests, other than doors.
The guys waiting tables stand so close during meals that I offered one a seat with us.
No smoke detectors and given the rooms are above the kitchen I think this should be sorted.
No Laundry service.
WiFi was excellent.
Satellite TV was excellent.

Staff:
Really really friendly and would bend over backwards to assist at all times.
The legendary Charley wasn't there but he is mentioned in other reviews and in the villa guest book.

The food is nice but not many veggie options and unfortunately you have to order prior to dinner. I understand why but it's not overly nice to have someone standing over you while you decide.

There were holes in the blanket on our bed, (better to just not put it on), not really any view from the pool which is very small or the roof terrace which is quaint. The room we stayed in was definitely outdated and some things were quite inconvenient, no bedside table on one side for instance, no fridge, no mirror in the bedroom, marks on desk and chair, etc. The room was quite small and situated next to the kitchen with a door that sort of opened on the reception/dining area so didn't feel overly private.

We have been paying about the same rate at other acccomodation for our trip across Sri Lanka, and Clove Villa is distinctly average in comparison.

The pros- breakfast was simple but really delicious, and kudos to a friendly team who were very accomodating of our packed schedule to prep breakfast for us each morning at 630.  We didn't eat dinner or lunch here.  The small pool area is gorgeous with a clean and sparkling pool and elegant garden surrounds plus comfy deck chairs and poolside loungers.  Two washbasins in a roomy bathroom was another plus.  There was a tv- possibly good for some people.  Was a safe for valuables, aircon, and shower temperature and pressure were good.

Cons- we paid extra for a deluxe room rather than standard, and although large it was dark and gloomy.  Only one tiny window in a bathroom that was tiled completely in black, and two small windows in the room one of which looked out over the lobby of the hotel (ie inside) and the other frosted over, presumably for privacy but blocked out light.  The whole room also felt a bit shabby, or tattered around the edges.  No minifridge- which surely must be a necessity in heat like this? Chocolate we had opened was eaten by bugs overnight, understandably as nowhere to keep it!

Really enjoyed the pool which was quiet and tucked away at the back of the villa, which in itself is a quiet area. Not much when it comes to facilities as this was sort of like a big house with a cosy setting. felt a bit too gloomy in the common area. 

Rooms were well designed, comfortable and very clean. No complains here at all.

Breakfast was western, very standard and simple. We would have liked to see some variety or local dishes. On one of the mornings, a big group of Indian tourists checked out early and we asked for the same dishes they had and that was good.

The Villa is directly opposite the Mahaweli Reach Hotel, so all we needed to do was cross over to the other side of the street to get to a really sumptuous buffet dinner and a brilliant spa (Spa Ceylon) treatment. It was also a nice experience walking along the river (in the hotel premises).

Honestly, I don't think this Villa deserves to be rated so high on TripAdvisor. It's good but not great.","Quite OK but not out of this world","2016-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d3447429-r372530141-Clove_Villa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Our room too was lacking character but it was clean and tidy.  What the Clove Villa lacked was safes within the bedrooms, a license to sell alcohol, a minibar, insufficient clothes hangers, a bedside table.  There was only one upright chair in the bedroom and we had the smallest veranda I have ever seen. The bathroom was very good.  The food was not of a particularly high standard and breakfast was pretty ordinary.  On the plus side there was Mr Charlie.  Here was a man who earned his keep:  he cooked the meals, he served at table, he fed the fish and, in all probability, he was the pool attendant.  He never ceased to be cheerful.

We wanted a beautiful property to relax, read a book, spend time together, eat good food, and recharge.

The property itself is indeed beautiful—newly refurbished and tastefully done. Surrounded by tea gardens and tall Eucalyptus trees, the ambiance is tranquil, with birds chirping throughout the day. With only us as guests for 2 out of our 3 nights, it was a very peaceful property.

The food was generally good in terms of taste.

So, why were we not happy with our stay and wished we had chosen a different property?

The issue was with the service and our experience with the staff.

We usually find SEA hospitality to be amazing, but the service here was neither polished nor warm and welcoming. On the night we arrived, around 11:30 PM, the staff were available to welcome us and serve hot meals, which was appreciated. But from there, things went downhill.

Despite the property advertising that breakfast, lunch, dinner, and high tea were included in the package, we encountered several issues. For breakfast, we were told we could only select one option. If we wanted both scrambled eggs and waffles, we had to pay extra - no problem, but usually when you say meals are covered, you don't put such limitations. Right after Stafford Bungalow we stayed at another 5-star beach property which also came with a full package and there, the chef and staff went above and beyond and even made us meals which were not on the menu! 

For lunch, we ordered Sri Lankan rice and curry, but were told it wasn't available without ample notice—notice that wasn't mentioned the night before or at breakfast. High tea, advertised on their website and social media, was just a slice of sponge cake and tea. When questioned, they said the full high tea was paid, but they hadn’t asked if we wanted it. The chef later offered complimentary high tea for the next day but repeatedly asked us to have a light lunch to avoid too much food - making us feel like we were eating too much. 

My impression is that they thought they'd get away with a low-effort high-tea. When they saw that we complained, they lied saying it was paid. And later to cover it, the chef said we will offer it as a complimentary service to us. 

Cheese platters advertised online were another issue. When requested, the butler seemed confused, eventually serving basic cheese more suitable for a sandwich.

During checkout, we were repeatedly asked to return an adapter we had left in the room. Despite informing them where it was, they couldn't find it until we personally pointed it out. It made us feel like they thought we were stealing it and taking it with us. 

Overall, we felt hesitant to order food, worried if it was available or if we'd be made to feel like we were eating a lot. Whether due to laziness since we were the only guests or a possible racist undertone—favoring Western guests over us Asians—the service left much to be desired.

It's a shame that such a beautiful property left us with a sour taste. Perhaps others, especially from Europe or the USA, might receive better service, but we did not have the positive experience we hoped for.","Beautiful property, but the staff and service left us wanting!

The room is well kept with sufficient furniture and the right comfort. Food was delightful and the chef happy to discuss the preference of meals. 
Only drawback was the level of understanding. Though they may have tried to do their best, estate workers aren’t professionals without the right training in hospitality which reflects badly. When we were asked to speak to the Manager, unfortunately could not find anyone who looked a professional. 
We feel this could be improved by recruiting professional staff or giving a proper training to the existing ones.

While this property generally gets very good reviews, I think we were unlucky on two accounts. Firstly the weather; it was pouring for most of the time we were there. We did however managed to have one high tea on the lawn, which was lovely. 
Secondly, and much more importantly,  the manager was not at the property during most of our stay.  This meant we encountered a number of hiccups, which may not necessarily be the norm. Our driver had not been to the property before and had trouble getting directions from the staff.  The staff did not speak much English so when we arrived we did not get a proper over view of the property. There was no internet during our stay so when we tried to download the property web site (to get our own information) this was also impossible. The staff’s lack of English meant that breakfast orders were mixed up and other requests were confused. The dinner for the two nights we were there was exactly the same- a choice of Sri Lanka or chicken dinner.

We stayed in the generously sized front room, which actually has a private terrace over looking the garden. The room was suppose to be a double room but it was actually two single beds pushed together.  The beds were not the same height as the mattresses were of different thicknesses. The rainy weather meant the room was quite damp. I tried to be “green” and not ask for the towels to be changed after one use but this was a mistake as the towels did not dry all day. 

The manager arrived back during our stay, but we were disappointed when one couple, who asked, were given a tour of the property but no one else was invited to join in.

While this review may sound a bit harsh the price of the bungalows is not cheap so one tends to expect top-notch service. The property is lovely and with a little more attention to detail from staff and management this property could take its rightful place among many of the other period bungalows which offer accommodation in tea country. Please at least print off the hotel web site information and leave it in a folder in the room. Please make sure some one with good English is resident at all times.","Beautiful place but be sure to visit when the manager is in","2016-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r344729928-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Having breakfast and afternoon tea on the lawn is delightful. The setting is charming, the staff are friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere amongst the mostly UK guests resident whilst we were there convivial.

However, it is a fair step from the town of Nurawa Eliya along a twisting hill road that ends in what is little more than a dirt track. So, whilst there is insufficient to entertain you for long at the bungalow itself, going anywhere else does feel like a bit of a flog. Furthermore, the choice of food and drink is very limited and the quality of the former uninspiring.","On balance, it's a miss from us","2016-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d4007613-r342666094-Stafford_Bungalow-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Just to put this review in context, there are some aspects of the hotel that are just not suited to my tastes and requirements (no fault of the hotel though). 

So here are the things you need to know before booking Niyagama: it’s 20 mins plus to Galle and there are no restaurants and shops in the vicinity, there is no TV in the room nor a kettle to make coffee or tea, no room service and alcohol is not served in the premises. Children below 12 aren’t allowed in (the silence is one of the highlights of the property). 

The positives during my stay were that I was offered an upgrade and a late check out, which was very nice of them. 

But here is where I began to have conflicted feelings about this place. The hotel arranges tuk tuk transfers into Galle and I was told this was cheaper than taking one myself. Turned out it was not. Airport transfers are cheaper by half if you book from a taxi device yourself. A mosquito repellant with a sticker price of SLR 250 was charged to me at SLR 300! Really? Is that SLR 50 really more important than the perception this creates amongst guests? My other issues were with the food (fine per se but begins to get boring on the third day and the closest restaurants are all in Galle) and the patchy wifi in the rooms. The hotel says wifi is available in public areas so I guess this is expected. 

Lastly, and this really hurt, I was charged a ridiculously low exchange rate by their Manager when exchanging dollars even though the hotel used a higher rate when converting the price of my massage from USD to SLR. Nor was I given a receipt. I was told this is an additional “service” and therefore the rates were lower. Next time, please inform guests of the exchange rate before completing the transaction. 

In all, I was expecting great things from Niyagama but unfortunately my experience came up short. ","Mixed feelings ","2017-12","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d3700783-r546329268-Niyagama_House-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The dining experience was okay although limited, we wouldn't want every meal in-house, luckily there are a small number of other hotel restaurants nearby, KK Beach was a particularly nice Hotel and restaurant just a short tuktuk ride away with really good food and service. 
As lovely as the staff at Tabula Rasa are, some could do with good service training and Gin and Tonic is always a good test. At Tabula Rasa the G&T arrives as a glass with a measure of local gin (no choice) and a bottle of tonic water, everywhere else including KK Beach we were offered a choice of gin, ice and lemon already in the glass. To their credit, Tabula Rasa did bring ice and lemon each time after we asked for it.  The wine list was disappointing, there wasn't one, it was red or white and sometimes there was a choice between two reds or two whites but not always, I have to say that it's not very Small Luxury Hotels in respect of food and drinks.

The manager was very nice and asked us to leave a nice review because the rating has been slipping, I understand why.

- musikken i restauranten er MEGET høj og spiller hele dagen
- Restaurantpersonalet taler meget dårlig engelsk og i kombi med musikken, er det næsten umuligt at forstå, hvad der bliver sagt. 
-  morgenmaden bestod af to serveringer + brød. Første servering var frugt og der blev ikke fjernet tallerkner, før anden servering blev serveret. 
- personalet ‘glemte’ vores juice og gentagne gange måtte vi spørge efter servietter. 
- som udgangspunkt er der pænt og rent, men hvorfor pudser man ikke glassene ved poolens viewpoint. 
- vi spurgte om kaffepulver til værelset og blev lovet, at det ville blive bragt til værelset - det kom aldrig. 
- da vi havde tjekket ud og betalt, fik vi at vide, at vores bil var ankommet.

There were good aspects of Glendoven - the staff are friendly and speak good English. The scenery around it is great and the locals are sweet. The rooms are comfortable. 

However the poor aspects of it let it down massively for me. First of all, it's difficult to find. Our driver drove around for a long time until we found it. The road there is horrid and bumpy. Secondly, once there one is stuck with their restaurant 'options' as there is not much to choose from and prices are expensive. Breakfast is not included either and it's a poor spread in comparison to some of the other less valued hotels we stayed in around Sri Lanka. Thirdly, there is no heating - only in the restaurant and the main living room where the staff light an open fire. But the rooms can be very cold. Fourthly, this place does not offer any past time opportunities. It could have a hot tub or an exercise room or deck chairs to soak up the sun and so on. Instead it has a very small unconventional pool table, some magazines and wifi - that only works in the main living room. I wouldn't stay here unless it has a big make over taking on board the points raised above. Otherwise we would happily stay somewhere for a better Nuwera Eliya experience.

Now the negative – the property is new and seems like that the service issues are still being ironed out.

However MAKE SURE you book a sea view room as 9 of the circa 50 rooms have NO view just a poorly painted wall and with limited natural light or sunlight they are damp. The hotel requests that you leave the air conditioning on constantly (even when out of the room) to reduce the condensation that is created in the room and storage, ie wardrobe etc. clothing and bedding had a damp smell after two days of our four day stay.  These rooms are known as ‘Fortress Rooms’ obviously lower cost but not worth it compared to the more pleasant and comfortable experience in a sea view room. 

The pool, restaurant and public areas are all fine, the beach / sea access whilst limited and shared with public visitors was also fine. Spotted turtles on most days.  Sea too rough on the other side of the reef for swimming, other than in protected bay. 

Restaurant food was very good and the staff were very professional. A large group booking, (a school reunion with guests flying in from all over the world ) did not affect our stay, and the buffets laid on were very good.  Because of the large group booking it was not possible to change rooms and a complimentary buffet meal was given as a gesture from the management  in view of our disappointment.  

The immediate surrounding areas weren’t great for external restaurants, but head for the surf areas to the east of the hotel (Ahangama) for some better restaurants.  We ended up returning to the hotel after a fruitless trip to the west.

We are distressed to hear about the dissatisfaction you had with the cuisine. We analysed the dishes you have had and apart from one dish that was redone, we cannot comprehend the reason that necessitated  a 3 star rating and a headline of ""bad food"" In retrospect we feel that it would have been helpful if we could have addressed the reasons for the concerns with the key staff members whom you have mentioned by name (Asela our Director Food & Beverage and Khan Our Indian Cuisine Chef. ) If we can learn your concerns even at this stage, we can certainly address the issues.

But moving on from just the staff, there were severe shortcomings which ruined our stay.
Firstly, wanting to have your rooms cleaned at a reasonable time, I feel is not asking too much and only when it got past 2pm on our third day did I raise a complaint. It seems every day, the time got pushed back to a point where it appeared unprofessional, especially as they had no other reason than just “sorry”.
It may be hard, but I do not want to return to my room to find the bed has not been made or the room cleaned. In addition, on the first day, I informed housekeeping that our blinds, which covered the views of the fantastic scenery, did not work, and that was still the case on the third day. It seems only if you shout and complain you are heard, which is not what you want on a holiday.
The massage therapist was wonderful, but the lack of management oversight meant that while my wife and I were having messages, there would be drilling and banging in the room next door, which destroyed the ambience as with others who had booked a therapy session.
Food was of a good standard and so was the general cleanliness of the resort there are no issues here however, the fact that when you are on the beach or by the pool service meant that any requirements for drinks or food meant you had to go to the restaurant to order and then carry it back to your beds.
Fellow travellers, if I were asked if I would revisit this hotel, my answer would be yes, but in the knowledge that services and amenities may not be what other 4* hotels may be; however, the staff on the ground were absolutely wonderful.
The place lacked managerial oversight, no doubt sitting in their office waiting for the busy season to start before they surfaced.

The hotel itself is nice and very clean but overall we found it to be underwhelming.

Staff were not the most professional or welcoming. Reception were aloof, waiting staff inexperienced or untrained (we had six different employees ask us the same question during dinner in a space of a few minutes) and a chef was on his mobile phone wandering around the tables during dinner service.  We felt this was due to a lack of management presence as we did not once see anyone clearly in charge.

We were hoping to see strong Sri Lankan influences but it felt as if the vibrant culture of the country had been muted to suit a more contemporary feel. The interior of the hotel could have been anywhere.

The rooms were generously sized and cleanliness faultless. The bathroom in particular was spotless and had everything one could need. Laundry service excellent however there was no need for garments to be returned in plastic packaging.

The food was average and we found there to be limited choice in terms of authentic local dishes.  The catering setup felt somewhat of a lazy operation.  The drinks however were good with delicious iced teas and fresh coconuts.

The highlight of the hotel was the pool.  The pool attendants were faultless and really welcoming and helpful.  The view was beautiful with stilt fishermen and turtles feeding just meters in front.  It is a shame that more of the cultural influences had not translated through to the rest of the hotel.

Overall a nice hotel but sadly lacking oomph.","Underwhelming","2018-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r659363351-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I don’t however understand the numerous awards it has received.
The position of this hotel is good in that it is right on the Ocean. However the sea is rough and you would need to walk down the beach before attempting a swim. There is an attractive pool plus sun loungers on the lawns.
We had a ground floor room with doors out to a small seating area and then directly on to the lawn; you can lie in bed and see the sea. Bed was big and comfortable and the room was bigger than most. There was an excellent shower and freestanding bath as well as two sinks, so a good bathroom.
We only stayed three nights and ate only once in the seafood restaurant; food was ok but service was somewhat hot and miss.
Breakfast is fine without being great. 
We ate in Galle where there are many restaurants and a degree of “life”.
Indeed the biggest downside of the hotel is that it is so far out of Galle; at least half an hour. We had been in Sri Lanka for some time and Galle is the only town we have found in which we would wish to spend some time.
There is also an issue with the Tuk Tuk drivers who seem to represent the local “mafia” and grossly overcharge (3500Rupees for a return trip to Galle, 800 Rupees to the local pharmacy). Indeed, when we asked the hotel to arrange a car to Colombo, they did it through the Tuk Tuk gang. Shops and taxi drivers have to pay commission to these people as well. They represent a significant negative and the hotel needs to resolve this problem - perhaps a hotel mini bus shuttle going to Galle and back would be a good start.
In conclusion, if I was tired out and wanted a week by the pool, this would be fine. If I wanted to take advantage of Galle, I would find a hotel there. As such my score is based upon an average of Hotel being good and location being poor.","Good Resort Hotel but out of Town","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r658425447-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The inner court yard and view through the hotel to the sea were beautiful. There was a delay booking in and we weren’t on any lists which wasn’t the best welcome. Eventually we got room 35 and we’re takrn up by by a hostess. She explained the room amenities in detail and the hotel geography however failed to tell us anything about the dining options available and associated costs? The room was structurally stunning, split level with a wonderful view of the sea but when we were settling in we noticed numerous problems. The standalone bath was wobbly to use which meant I had to adjust the feet and on doing so noticed that it was dirty under the bath. The bath was damaged around the rim and the pop up handle kept falling off and it was dirty behind. Under the bed didn’t look like it had ever been cleaned? There were brown splash stains on the wall of the toilet, we really didn’t want to know what that was and grouting and silicone was missing and dirty from around the showers area. Chrome fitting looked like they had never been cleaned? Spot lights were not properly covered with fittings which lead to dust and dirt falling into the sink, sometimes when we were using it. A chrome lamp in the room had a botched fix on the shade which looked like someone had over painted it with a rattle can prior to our arrival. All in all the room was not clean and in need of maintainance. This was carried on throughout the hotel as decking around the pool was uneven and loose and screws visible and sticking out. We saw a number of people tripping and this is an accident waiting to happen. Tiles around the pools were cracked and missing and some of the loungers and chairs were in need of a good power wash? All in all a tired hotel. We asked about dining options on numerous occasions and were only told about two, the buffet and set menu when there were actually six? It was only when Suranga the food and beverage manager got involved did we understand were and what we could eat but that was two days into our three days stay and as a result of a complaint to our kuoni rep. Suranga understood what a poor experience we were having and tried everything he could to improve our situation and make up for the previous poor service. Prior to him being involved the service and food were not what we would expect from a five star hotel? There never looked like there wereenough staff nor did it feel like they could provide 5 star service but I do think that was a hotel issue and we have no issue with individuals who looked overworked at times? There is no doubt that the standard of service and the food itself improved a lot after we complained but the damage was already done. We were supposed to get a visit from a manager about the room but that never materialised? We did find this hotel dissapointing on so many fronts and this is definitely not a five star hotel. It is such a shame as the location is idyllic and it makes us think the hotel has sat back on its laurels. Visiting this hotel made us feel dissapointed at what could have been and was not a relaxing end to our Sri Lankan tour?","Such a shame, could be so much better","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r656912806-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The gardens and pool are exceptional and service everywhere was extremely good.

Food was ok, not exceptional bearing in mind this properties status.

The ocean loft room, while nice, did not meet our expectations and in reality wasn’t as fresh looking as the pictures.

When we were given the room, our butler didn’t know how to use the coffee machine. Furthermore, the tv in the room upstairs wasn’t working. The room is two storey and there was only one phone upstairs which was quite inconvenient as we had to rush up every time we had a call from reception or every time we needed something.

The food of the main restaurant was average. 

The nicest thing was the stretch of beach with the crashing waves. We enjoyed walking by the sea and it was nice to fall asleep at night to the sound of the waves. Also, the trees on the premises are gorgeous and filled with cute squirrels.

We stayed two nights and the most disappointing part was when we were settling the bill before our departure. We had settled the first night a month in advance as per their policy. At check out, when we were settling the second night, we noticed that they had charged us extra for the difference in foreign exchange relating to the first night. It seems that at checkout, the foreign exchange rate had become higher and they decided to apply it not only on the rate of the second night but also on the rate of the first night which had already been settled a month in advance! In the grand scheme of things, the amount was not significant but we didn’t appreciate their approach.

In a nutshell, the hotel is overpriced, not greatly maintained and the service is not up to par.","Average stay","2018-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r646296981-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We also appreciate your comments regarding the property, size of the room, the room amenities and also for the comment made on improving our Spa facilities.

Since the reviewer has mentioned the room been damp it is mainly due to the unpredictable weather which we had to experience during the past weeks and especially when the property is located on the beach and facing the sea. Therefore, the humidity plays a challenging factor.

Regrettably we have to decline the comments made on our chef for not appreciating the guest's feedback. Our guests have always appreciated the wide variety of menu options available in the hotel. Our chefs are always delighted to tailor make any food items that are required by our guests. We have a selection of 50 main dishes in our menus. 10 verities of soup items, 20 verities of starters and selection of 15 deserts which covers preferences of majority of the guests. Further we also offer theme nights.

When it comes to dining, there are three restaurants to choose from. The White restaurant which is the all day dining restaurant. The Salty Snapper offering informal al fresco dining overlooking the beach and specialized in seafood menus. The Duo our fine dining restaurant is open only for dinner. However, the reviewer had only chosen to dine in the WHITE restaurant. The table deco in the White restaurant is changed regularly during breakfast, lunch and dinner.

We do apologize when we fail. We implement all good suggestions made by guests and we also explain when we disagree. Our replies are based on verifiable facts and as we state in several replies, our responses are for the benefit of future visitors to the site. 

Once again we thank the reviewer for the review and we also look forward to welcoming them back again in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Road, Koggala 80000 Sri Lanka","Koggala","Sri Lanka","80000",,"Matara Road",,"601108","5.966639","Koggala, Galle District, Southern Province","80.35703","The Fortress Resort & Spa","2268","4.7","16","29","99","375","1749","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1189030-d601108-Reviews-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.fortressresortandspa.com","2018-10-27","OTHER","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beautiful property.  Large bedrooms with open plan walks in shower, separate spa bath and 2 sinks.  Good quality towels, bed linen and bathroom soaps/ shampoo etc ( Bulgari).
Room had damp and we had to have a de-humidifier on 24 hrs /day whilst we were there and that had to be emptied every 6 hrs- so the room wasn’t that comfortable to be in- the floor was clammy and damp feeling and the atmosphere not great,  It definitely affected our chests. 
The breakfast was ‘average’ at best, and laid out in a room where some of the staff ate breakfast.  There was the same menu for lunch and dinner- and it was not well cooked - at best ‘average’ to ‘poor’ and we returned some of the food as it was too bad to eat ( recommend KK beach and Galle Fort Hotel to eat).  The chef did not appreciate any feedback and just walked away when he was brought out to us and ignored me the next day.
It is the same dining area for breakfast, lunch and dinner- and no change to table dressing or anything so felt very ‘samey’ and not ‘elegant’. 
The hotel is 15km out of Galle and the Tuk Tuk cost $20 round trip- a significant premium to the local charge.
The spa is ‘tired’ and needs upgrading. The treatment I had was average, but the room was cold and the towels felt damp- so I nearly stopped the treatment- but at the end of it had to have a shower to warm up.

Wouldn’t go back and as it is at the moment not sure I’d really recommend it- in fact have suggested to friends to not go there who are visiting Sri Lanka.

There are issues with shabbiness of the external and internal areas of the building and deck area around the pool, the place could do with some refurbishment. There are a lot of crows/other birds that make a lot of mess around the garden and pool area that isn't cleaned up adequately, some of the sunbeds had bird poo on them and the grass is filthy. 
The service is great as you enter the hotel and poolside service is very good, the staff are all very friendly and do their best to be helpful. 

The breakfast is very good, with a large selection and good bread, something hard to find in Sri Lanka. 

Food wise however, breakfast is definitely the better offering than the options later in the day.  For the price you pay and the supposed 5 star rating, i've had far better service and food in a £10 a night backpacker hostel in India. 
My girlfriend and I are vegan, which can cause some problems when travelling but you expect this not to be the case in a Luxury hotel. Unfortunately on the first night we had some issues with our meal as although they had altered some of the vegetarian options for us to make them vegan, they had done so with no creativity or thought as to the flavour. This may have been partly due to a communication problem with the staff or lack of skill on the chefs part but it didn't seem like they had had any training for this sort of request. I'd hate to see how they handle the request of somebody with a serious allergy. 

When one of the service managers came over to apologise it didn't really seem like he was listening so we were surprised when they took the meals we had had a problem with off the bill. (Something you would have been offered immediately in any bog standard UK restaurant if you were unhappy with the food.)

The restaurant definitely needs to get with the times and up their game with regards to these kind of requests. We had thought about going for the Fine Dining experience but after the first night we really didn't have confidence in the quality of the chefs to pay that much for a meal here.  
Instead we went for the 'safe option' of Sri Lankan rice and curry for the second night, which despite being vegan and edible really wasn't as good as you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. As a comparison, we ate in one of the restaurants (Nuga Gama) at Cinnamon Grand in Colombo a few days before and the food was of a much higher standard there. 

Although I can only personally comment on the options available to vegans, my mother had some of the other fish/seafood options and said they were't up to the standard she'd expect either.

If you're not too fussed about food and happy with a beautiful pool and good rooms then maybe it would be worth the 5 stars to you but I honestly don't think its quite there.

But then when one child was hospitalized over the Christmas only 4 of the 7 of us could travel. Happily my son is recovering well from what turned out to be appendicitis but to say the hotel was disinterested is an understatement . We had insurance so will recover a good chunk of the cancellation cost but the hotel made no concessions what so ever. So we had three huge rooms for four people for the four nights ! The hotel was not full but was absolutely sticking to its cancellation policy. Having spend close to an additional usd1000 on dinners and room service we could have expected some gesture ? When I was charged usd1.5 for using a coffee capsule in the room I felt very ripped off. Afraid we would not stay again.

The suite has a very spacious downstairs area, including an indoor plunge pool and a half bathroom. Upstairs is pretty much the same format as their standard rooms (we had other family members booked into these), except that the staircase cuts into the bathroom area, resulting in a bathroom not as spacious as the standard room version (notable missing items were a jacuzzi bathtub and a second washbasin). The layout of the suite was a bit odd, for example having an entrance on each floor meant having to put up 2 do not disturb signs every time. There was bizarrely just one phone (upstairs). The result being we ended doing a lot more stair climbing than planned! The property is fairly dated and certain aspects of the rooms are due for a refurb. For example, our balcony door was almost falling off its hinges...

The resort has a reasonably large pool and plenty of loungers. The beach is a few feet below but is very rocky. They had roped out what was a really small area where you could actually enter the water. The beach setup wasn't a surprise though, as rocky/inaccessible beaches are a pretty common feature around resorts in Sri Lanka.

There are 3 restaurants in the hotel. The main one serves all 3 meals and includes buffet breakfast and dinners. Then there was a casual seafood restaurant (not sure if this was open at the time) and a fine dining venue which has a set menu every night (priced at around Rs 15k). We stayed on a full board basis, and one positive was how generous they were with the inclusions. While the fine dining option incurred a surcharge, in the main restaurant we were able to order anything from the extensive menu under our package. This included things like lobster and imported steak - and all this available for lunch and for dinner as well (we could combine the buffet and a la carte options). Drinks prices were reasonable, with cocktails priced at around Rs 1,000 (£5). The quality of the food varied, but was generally decent. The dinner buffet selection was perhaps lacking in variety however (although they did have different themed nights). Desserts were disappointing as well - which was ironic, this being the place that sells the world's most expensive dessert!

Service was a weak point. We endured extensive delays for orders during some meals, and occasionally incorrect items were delivered as well. Our suite came with an assigned butler, but this was effectively a gimmick, as our butler was actually a waiter in the main restaurant, and apart from during our meals was generally nowhere to be seen (with no specific way of contacting him provided either). To their credit, after a major complaint was filed during one lunch, they really stepped up their game for our final dinner, where we had our butler and another waiter attending to our every need. Shame we had to complain to get there though.

Overall, this is a reasonable luxury property, but it has definitely seen better days, and I feel it no longer lives up to its billing as one of the finest beach resorts on the island. Although we enjoyed discounted local rates, at the full tourist rates this place would be overpriced, especially relative to some other resorts around Sri Lanka. There are no shortage of higher end beach resorts on this part of the island (many of which are newly opened), and I would definitely be trying out a few others before considering a return to The Fortress.","Dated property.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for your review and for highlighting that your stay at Cinnamon Wild Yala was ""Imme noch Top"" (still top). We're delighted to hear that despite some issues, you still find us to be a great hotel with very good food. We're also glad you enjoyed the proximity to the National Park and the potential for wildlife visits, even if it was just monkeys on your roof this time!

We sincerely apologize for the difficulties you experienced with our reception staff during check-out and the apparent lack of internal communication regarding your booking. It is certainly concerning to hear that your emails to our central team were not effectively communicated to the front desk. This is not the seamless experience we aim to provide, and we assure you that we are addressing this matter internally to improve our communication protocols and staff training to ensure such situations do not recur.

We truly appreciate your valuable feedback, as it helps us identify areas for improvement. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for an even smoother and more enjoyable stay in the future.

Thanks & Regards,

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback following your recent stay with us. We’re truly grateful for your kind words about our professional and friendly staff, clean and well-stocked rooms, and the quality of our food. Your appreciation has been shared with Chanaka, Atte, and Danushka—they are delighted to have made a positive impression on your experience.

We sincerely regret, however, that your early morning safari breakfast experience did not meet your expectations. As a resort situated at the doorstep of Yala National Park, we understand the importance of providing nourishing and convenient options for our guests heading out early for wildlife excursions. It is clear from your feedback that the current breakfast box did not meet the standards you were expecting, and we are genuinely sorry for the inconvenience this caused—especially given your medical needs.

Your insights have been taken very seriously. We recognize the importance of offering more flexibility and quality in our takeaway breakfast options, and we are reviewing our procedures with the aim of introducing a more satisfying experience for our safari-going guests. We also acknowledge your comment about buffet availability post-safari, and we will revisit our policies to ensure we better accommodate guest needs in situations like yours.

We are truly grateful for your candid observations, which help us improve and refine the experience for future guests. Should you consider visiting us again, we would love the opportunity to restore your confidence in our hospitality and service.

Warm regards,
Sandushi Wickramasooriya

The only negative is the fact that even though this is a wildness lodge in which many guests go on safari, they don't accommodate those guests.
We were offered a ""box snack"" to pick up at 5:30 am before leaving for our morning ride, since the breakfast buffet would likely be closed by the time we returned. (Closes at 10am) I asked about coffee, I was told we could make the package mix in our room. When ordering, we were told we could only have a 1 item sandwich, meat or cheese, not both. How cheap. When it came time to eat this box snack, the fruit & vegetable containers had opened and mixed in the bottom of the box, soaking the box. The chicken was a very thing smear of chicken salad on what was now a soggy bun, and inedible anyway. I had juice, banana and very small cookie. Really, this replaces the beautiful hot buffet!! Not in my opinion. We returned at 10:20, & heard people still in the restaurant. I take cancer medication & begged to go up for a decent meal. I was denied. 
What poor planning and cheap treatment for safari guests. I have been on 5 African safaris. For each camp, we had a continental breakfast with pastries, juice and coffee before going on our rides. Some guests didn't go. The lodge had a breakfast buffet for those guests, & kept it hot for the safari guests returning. 
I think I would suggest checking out the Hilton next door before booking.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for taking the time to provide such a comprehensive and candid review of your recent stay with us. While we are truly sorry to hear that your experience was extremely disappointing and did not meet your hopes, we sincerely appreciate your honesty, as it provides us with crucial insights for improvement.

We are glad to hear that you found our staff to be genuinely kind and helpful, and we appreciate you acknowledging their hospitality. However, we are deeply concerned to learn that this was where the positives ended for you.

We sincerely apologize that your safari experience was chaotic and underwhelming. We understand your frustration with the overcrowding of jeeps, the feeling of a ""traffic jam,"" and the limited wildlife sightings. We share your concern regarding the impact of noise, fumes, and the sheer number of vehicles on the animals and the park's environment, as well as the issues of single-passenger jeeps and litter. While the management of Yala National Park is under the purview of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, we are actively engaged with our safari operators to advocate for and ensure more responsible and sustainable practices. We regret that this aspect of your visit was disheartening.

We are truly sorry that the hotel itself felt tired and poorly maintained. Your specific feedback about broken lights in your room is unacceptable, and we deeply apologize for the inconvenience and discomfort this caused, especially having to remove bulbs yourself. We are addressing this immediately with our maintenance team to ensure all room amenities are in perfect working order.

We also regret that the atmosphere throughout the resort felt more like a ""children's club"" than a relaxing retreat. We understand your disappointment with loud music and cricket in the main bar, and the noise levels in the quieter bar area. We aim to create an enjoyable environment for all our guests, and we apologize if our staff's response regarding music changes was unhelpful. We are reviewing our operational policies and staff training to better manage the ambiance in our public areas to cater to diverse guest preferences.

Regarding the buffet, we are sorry to hear that you found it to be average at best. We are continuously working to enhance our culinary offerings, and your feedback will be shared directly with our culinary team for immediate review and improvement. The description of the pool area as loud and chaotic, dominated by noisy families with little consideration for other guests, is also very concerning. We apologize if our staff did not seem adequately trained or empowered to manage the environment to balance family fun with the needs of guests seeking relaxation. We are reinforcing training on guest management and service delivery to ensure a more harmonious environment for everyone.

Most importantly, we are profoundly sorry to read about the presence of blood on the mosquito net around your bed. This is a severe lapse in our hygiene standards, and there is no excuse for it. Please be assured that we are launching an immediate and thorough investigation into this incident and reinforcing our stringent cleaning and inspection protocols to ensure such a lapse never occurs again.

We understand why you would not recommend our hotel or the safari experience given these significant issues, and we sincerely regret that we did not live up to your high hopes, especially compared to your expectations for a Hilton stay.

Your detailed feedback is invaluable to us. We are committed to making comprehensive improvements across all the areas you have highlighted to ensure that future guests have a truly serene and enjoyable experience.

I don’t typically write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience at Cinnamon Hotel in Yala, as it was extremely disappointing and felt more like a tourist trap than a relaxing getaway.

To begin with the positives: the staff were genuinely kind and helpful, and their hospitality was appreciated. Unfortunately, that was where the positives ended.

We visited primarily for the safari experience, which turned out to be chaotic and underwhelming. The park was overcrowded with safari jeeps, leading to what felt like a constant traffic jam. Over four hours, we saw only two elephants, a few birds, and some water buffalo. The much-hyped leopard sightings were non-existent, likely due to the loud noise, fumes, and the sheer number of vehicles swarming the area. It was disheartening to see the animals surrounded by such disruption, which directly contradicts the park’s claims of caring for wildlife. Additionally, many jeeps were carrying only one or two passengers, raising concerns about environmental sustainability. Litter and plastic waste throughout the park only added to our disappointment.

The hotel itself felt tired and poorly maintained. Our room had broken lights—so bad that I had to remove the bulbs myself in order to sleep. The atmosphere throughout the resort was more like a children’s club than a relaxing retreat. Children were running freely in all areas, including the main bar, which played loud music and showed cricket on a large screen. Even the quieter bar was filled with noise from children and shouting parents, leaving little room for a peaceful evening. When we suggested playing more relaxing music to help with the atmosphere, the staff simply said they couldn’t change it.

The buffet was average at best, and the pool area was loud and chaotic, again dominated by noisy families, with little consideration for other guests seeking rest or relaxation. Staff did not seem trained or empowered to manage the environment in a way that balanced family fun with the needs of other travelers.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel or the safari experience. We had high hopes, but unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. If you’re looking for a serene wildlife experience or a relaxing stay, this may not be the right choice.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for providing your feedback regarding your recent stay. We are pleased to hear that you found our staff lovely.

However, we are truly sorry to learn that other aspects of your experience did not meet your expectations. We sincerely apologize that you found the resort to be a bit rundown and that the presence of coach parties led to a noisy and chaotic dining room, as well as a crowded pool area. This is certainly not the serene and comfortable atmosphere we aim to provide for all our guests.

We understand your concerns about the overall busy nature of Yala National Park and how this influenced your perception of your stay with us. Your comments are invaluable as they highlight areas where we need to focus our efforts on facility upkeep and managing guest flow to ensure a more enjoyable and relaxing environment.

We regret that this experience means you would probably not choose to stay with us again. We truly value your candid input, as it assists us in our continuous efforts to improve our guest experience.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for taking the time to share your candid feedback regarding your recent stay. We are truly sorry to hear that your experience with us was disappointing and that you found our hotel to be overrated and overpriced.

We regret that you felt your lodge was only comfortable for a short stay and that our staff and services appeared ""shoddy"" to you. This is certainly not the standard of hospitality we aim to provide, and we sincerely apologize for any shortcomings you encountered. Your comments about the steamy, squashed restaurant and the milky-colored pool are taken very seriously, and we are addressing these operational and maintenance concerns with our respective teams immediately to ensure improvements.

We also understand your frustration with the pricing of drinks and apologize if this felt extortionate. We continuously review our pricing to ensure it is competitive while reflecting the quality of our offerings and unique location.

We are particularly saddened to learn that your stay with us was a disappointing end to your Cinnamon hotel tour in Sri Lanka, especially when your experiences at other Cinnamon properties were better. This is not the lasting impression we wish to leave.

Your feedback is invaluable in helping us identify areas where we need to make significant improvements. We truly hope that despite these issues, your overall travels in Sri Lanka were enjoyable.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala,

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent ""So So Experience"" at our hotel. We sincerely apologize that several aspects of your stay, particularly cleanliness and dining experience, did not meet your expectations and that you felt we did not meet a 5-star standard.

We are truly sorry to hear about the cleanliness issues you observed on the roads to the villas, as well as around the pool and lobby. Your comment about being warned about monkey dung is concerning, and we recognize that this, along with other cleanliness issues, directly impacts guest comfort. Please be assured that we are addressing these points immediately with our housekeeping and groundskeeping teams to ensure higher standards are consistently maintained.

We also regret the inconvenience you experienced with overcrowding in the dining area and having to queue. We are reviewing our service procedures and capacity management to enhance the dining experience, reduce wait times, and improve the overall flow for our guests. Your feedback on the variety and taste of the food is also noted, and our culinary team will be focusing on improvements in this area.

While we appreciate your recognition of our good location, we understand that an older property requires meticulous upkeep, and we apologize for falling short in certain areas. Your comments are invaluable as we continually strive to enhance our guest experience.

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future to demonstrate the improvements we are committed to making.

Это позиционирование не верно и вот почему - несмотря на достаточно высокую стоимость проживания (я оплатил 550 долларов США за сутки) есть претензия следующего содержания - отель удален от городской и морской инфраструктуры и я ехал туда своей семьей насладится природой, тишиной, умиротворением и атмосферой территории отеля. Выбрал отель о оплатил такой высокий чек (из-за того что отель находится в национальном парке и гостям отеля заявлялись преференции в близости к парку и доступности уникальных маршрутов по нему - отличных от людей проживающих в других отелях в самом городе). Претензия 1 - я не был проинформирован заранее что в случае дождей накануне эти маршруты могут стать не доступными и мне придется ехать дальше всех (если бы я остановился в городе) и вставать в 04:30 утра.
2 - за два дня пребывания - велись ремонтные работы в ресторане или на его крыше (работали дрели или отбойные молотки) с 10 до 17 часов!!!! это просто не допустимо!!!! постояльцы отеля находящиеся у бассейна или в ресторане не могли насладится тишиной и природой. Бедные дети (в том числе были гости с младенцами в колясках) которые слушали этот долбящий звук весь день!!! из отеля нельзя уйти погулять - национальный парк. Я считаю это немыслимым и администрация даже не предложила скидку на такое проживание или какую либо иную компенсацию. Это нормально для отеля 5 звезд???  Отель 5 звезд который дорожит своей репутацией и клиентом никогда не производит реновацию его не закрывшись от приема туристов или не предоставив этим туристам скидку за проживание.
3 - ни в одном 5 звездочном отеле в ресторане не допустим прием гостей одновременно с обслуживанием (обедом) работников отеля. Вы считаете это тоже нормальным? я бы не обратил в другом случае на это внимание но с учетом разницы методов в приеме пищи (в Шри Ланке кушают руками а не приборами) мне это нанесло определенный дискомфорт. Я никогда не пишу отзывы негативные но эти три момента  меня не удержат для того чтобы люди (будущие гости) знали о том что 5 звезд это не 5 звезд и не тратили свои тяжело заработанные деньги на ветер и негативные воспоминания.

Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to highlight areas where we can improve.

We understand your disappointment regarding the breakfast timing and the breakfast boxes.

We will definitely consider extending our breakfast hours to accommodate our guests better.

We apologize for the limited vegetarian options at our dinner buffet. We understand the importance of catering to diverse dietary needs and will work on expanding our vegetarian offerings.

It has been sensitively constructed to blend in within the jungle/  nature reserve surroundings and the individual chalets are very comfortable, nicely appointed with wooden furnishings, decent bathroom etc. the staff are all exemplary - friendly, eager to please and knowledgable and we stayed over New Year’s Eve when all the staff participated in the dinner and party including creating dance routines for the guests. Great sense of camaraderie.

On a slight negative note the  facilities are starting to look and feel a bit dated and certainly not worth to the extortionate prices they were charging over the Christmas and New Year period. These would be 5 star in London or the best resorts in Asia and certainly not value for money for a 4 star resort like Cinnamon Wild.

More seriously for most guests the main draw of visiting this resort (and what you are paying a lot of money for) is the safari experience but even that is now being rapidly spoiled. There seems to be no regulation on the number of jeeps or visitors in the park so it is overrun with noisy 4x4s (over 200 apparently) on the morning we were there - all raising to find a sighting of a leopard or elephant. Hence not surprising minimal chance of seeing anything under those conditions. I would certainly not visit again during the peak December to Feb period.

Seems like the safari operators are a law unto themselves and with the amount of money changing hands - US$40 per entry PER foreign tourists and another US$40 -100 per vehicle it certainly isn’t good value especially if you have experienced safaris in other parts of the world. In fact there was more wildlife in and around the resort itself including crocodiles in the lake, peacocks and monkeys strolling the grounds and even an elephant wandering around while we were there. I would certainly think twice about doing the safari again and probably only during the dry season - April to July. I know many other tourists we spoke to also had a disappointing safari experience. 

Finally although it has been one of longest wettest rainy seasons in Sri Lanka I was surprised how bad the road leading up to the 4 main 4/5 star resorts was and how I’ll prepared they were for receiving guests including arranging proper SUVs to ferry guest from the points normal cars couldn’t get past. All seemed a bit disorganised and the road leading to the resorts just incredibly poor. Hard to understand why the hotels have invested in this given how much they are charging tho I think the Hilton has paved just the section leading to its property:","Charming if slightly dated resort lifted by the great staff; think hard about visiting if just for the safari experience","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r932356484-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Yala is a dry zone and hardly experiences rain (one month at most during a full year).

We joked about this during our stay, we felt like we were on a reality tv show with hidden cameras...
We booked a jungle chalet that was advertised with pictures and wording that said it had a private balcony.  We were taken to a tiny adjoined room with shared balcony which unfortunately had a very loud Indian family staying next door, who were part of a group and they were yelling to each other from each of their balconies.  So we asked to be moved, and requested a room like the pictures with its own private balcony.  They absolutely understood the situation and rectified it immediately.  A great job, but tbh,  we were moved to the room that we booked and paid for.  So no real favours, but they did it well. 
We booked a safari with them for the next day, easily done. Then told an hour later that the national park, zone 1, which is right next door to them was closed for 3 days due to being too wet to take vehicles.  It was going to be repaired.  So to go on a safari we had to drive 1.5 hours to zone 5. Well, we are all there for a reason....so we reluctantly agreed. It was a bloody long day and that was the half day tour. On our return we are told if we want to do another half day zone 1 is open again...wtf. thought it was closed for 3 day?? We declined but the worst part was, I went to the restaurant later that afternoon to get some drinks and the same guide was telling another family that zone 1 was closed due to bad weather and they had to go 1.5 hours to zone 5. Wtaf. There is something dodgy going on here and I can't say it's just that hotel, I think the safari operators run this town and there is something that just doesn't feel right. But, we did the tour, we saw elephants water buffalo peacocks etc etc so the tour ticked the boxes. 
The food in the a la carte restaurant is shocking, but the buffet is outstanding. 
The floors inside and outside the rooms are incredibly slippery, scarily so. But the rooms are quite clean and well equipped. 
So you see, it was good, but it was bad.....so it gets 3 stars from us. ","A strange stay...","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r931266648-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Firstly, thank you very much for taking your time to review Cinnamon Wild Yala. We believe your effort will help us motivate our associates, improve our standards and encourage more tourists to visit our beautiful island and in particular to our destination in Yala.

Jungle chalets are different to one another as per the number of room occupants selected but the lighting nor the amenities are different to one another. All the chalets are pretty much in the same size range as well. However if the lighting was not enough, that is a criticism we take very constructively as we are working on a new lux level standard to the property.

We hope to have a better illuminated set of chalets when we see you again. Until next time, we wish you all the very best. Stay Safe. Cheers.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan

The views we had of the pool, lake and sunrise were stunning. Rooms were spacious and clean and the room boys went out of the way to make our stay comfortable.
Staff at the reception were also very friendly and helpful.

The reason for my Average rating is because of the buffet layout at the hotel.
Although the chicken saugage was marked 'halal' it was laid out in a double chafing dish sharing with pork sausages. Bacon and Pork were laid next to the halal meats at all the meals we went to the restaurants for. 

Most of the hotels we visited on our trip including Shangrila Hambantota AND Jetwing Yala had their pork and bacon in an isolated station which was much appreciated.
Although we did approach the chef about it the previous night  nothing was no action was taken the next day morning at breakfast.","Jetwing Lake 2024","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r987303996-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We appreciate your detailed insights and apologize for any shortcomings you experienced during your stay.

We're pleased to hear that you found the bedroom and bathroom spacious and that the provision of bathrobes and flip-flops added to your comfort. Regarding the hotel concept, it's important to note that the hotel's architecture, overseen by Mr. Vinod Jayasinghe, was designed to evoke the atmosphere of the Dambulla cave temple. The intention was to maintain the buildings in their current state, as they have come to resemble the concept of the Dambulla cave over the years.

Once again, we would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused during the stay and assure you that we continuously strive to maintain and enhance our property to provide the best possible experience for our guests.

Thank you again for your feedback, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for an improved experience in the future.

Staff are respectful and attentive in their service. Well trained and genuinely happy to help. A highlight of the stay.
Food is delicious throughout as are the drinks (though I have avoided the carnage of the evening buffet).
My downsides are that the hotel caters for large tour groups (nothing wrong with that) but as my room is located directly above the restaurant morning and evening noise levels are excessive, even the birds and monkeys have given up.  Additionally, the nightly party on the floor above means that any idea of a tranquil night on the balcony listening to the sounds of nature setting down are a far flung dream.

This category of room also has a large balcony but mostly unfurnished, with just a pair of small rocking chairs. The room and bathroom are both lovely, though our sink and vanity had ants. The rain shower and tub both are open to soak in the amazing view. 

Water seemed to be a scarce commodity as we had to call room service many times to have water brought to our room. 

Service was a bit lacking. The staff seemed shy and hesitant to help us. They seemed to be in groups together rather than coming to assist guests. We went to the Chinese restaurant and there was no one in there to greet us or seat us and it was 20 minutes after opening. When we finally stayed long enough and walked around looking for an employee, then we tried ordering from the menu but 1/4 of the menu items were not in stock.

Turn down was offered to us before dinner (dinner is served 7:30 - 10 and he came to our room just after 7), and we asked that he return while we were at dinner as we were getting ready in our room at the time. No one came back for turn down. 
 
The pool was beautiful, large, and refreshing with plenty of space to swim. Pool bar had a plethora of snacks and drinks at reasonable prices. 

Our second night we ate in the hotel buffet. The food was fine just standard buffet fare. We were still hungry later in the evening so we went ahead and ordered room service. The items we ordered were in our opinion better than the other meals we had there and brought straight to the room.","Cool property experience has room for improvement.","2022-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r833073884-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The staff are super friendly allowed us early checking at 10 a.m. and late check out free-of-Charge(this could be due to Covid-19 crisis) 
The pool is HUGE but not so well kept as the floor is full of rough edges.
The room is spacious for a deluxe but lacked compared to Jetwing blue deluxe room by great lengths .
the wash room is big and neat.
The dinner buffet is OK but lacked variety, especially on vegetables types. The new serving methods (due to Covid-19 issue) by the staff is not so smooth and guests have to wait to in long Ques to get served due to lack of staff. Further, some items seems to vanish and never seems to return back.
The breakfast buffet is OK, clearly lacked variety and again the serving by the staff  didnt go all that smoothly.
Overall Food isnt that great compared to Jetwing Blue..
The hotel area is sometimes occupied by monkeys so take care. The set of rooms situated seperatly(with Spa) is not so accessible and only stairs are available (no lift).
The Wifi is super slow and unreliable 
The TV had only few channels (less than 10) though they advertised as 31.
The power seems to go out FREQUENTLY .... so be prepared to wake up middle of the night without AC...

(I understand it’s a foreign language, but the level was below what you’d expect anywhere)

This doesn’t sound like a huge deal, but it really affected our stay.

We tried to plan various trips/excursions and treatments in the spa, only to realise that the member of staff we were dealing with was either unable to understand what we were staying, or came away from an interaction with a completely different understanding of our expectations than was intended.

The staff are so friendly that it makes it such a spoiler that they can’t do what you ask or arrange things like you want when you try to engage with them. They were wonderful people!!!

I spent over an hour and a half over two days of my stay trying to organise a spa treatment for my girlfriend and I, only to ultimately fail. At dinner the first night the customer services manager came to see us at dinner to see if she could accommodate us in the spa the next day, only to ultimately not make the booking correctly either. Then the next morning we attended the spa to have our treatments only to be told they weren’t booked... upon discussing this with the manager a new booking was rushed, and then we still ended up not getting what we had tried to arrange initially.

Very disappointing as the hotel would be truly epic if this didn’t happen.

There’s nothing I’d say they should do to improve the standard of the hotel or facilities, but they need at least one person in each department who’s absolutely fluent in English.","Poor English lets an excellent hotel down badly","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r740968666-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

It is however a decent base for nearby towns and sights (Sigiriya approx 30 min drive, Polonnaruwa about 1,5 hours). The hotel can be found at the end of a poorly maintained dirt track, but it's in beautiful surroundings with the small lake leading to lots of wildlife, especially birds. The rooms are a good size, clean and generally well kept. Beds are a nice size and are very comfortable. The staff are very attentive and seem to want to do their best for their guests. 

The negative side of it being so isolated is (for example) that the hotel can charge high prices at their two restaurants. There's nothing else close enough to choose from. A dinner for two (1 starter, 2 main course, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine) at their restaurants will cost you between 6000-9000 rupees. You don't have much choice either, as there isn't much else on offer in Dambulla which is a 15 minute drive away. 

They also offer (very) inflated transport prices. I had a chat with one of the managers about this whilst I was there, and he seemed to understand my feedback. We found a great local driver online and he was about half the price of what the hotel were asking for a Polonnaruwa and safari day trip. Feel free to send me a message if you want his details. 

We experienced several power cuts during our stay. If you have a room over the restaurant, be aware that you will be affected by noise/loud music until approx 10:30pm. Not ideal if you have children or have a particularly early start. They were kind enough to end the music a little bit earlier once they understood that we were getting up at 4am.

Lots of positives, a few negatives. All in all an average stay for the price that we paid. A nice bit of luxury for a night or two if that's what you're looking for.","Isolated (for better and for worse)","2019-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r734249501-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

What started as a very positive experience quickly turned negative. 

Firstly, the hotel itself is lovely, our room was fabulous with great views, and the pool area was great. On arrival we enjoyed a delicious a la carte meal in the restaurant with great service.

The next day we went to see some sites before resting by the pool in the afternoon. Come 4pm, a large number of Sri Lanka locals checked in. This would not have been a problem, but the hotel atmosphere completely changed. Gone was our relaxing, 5-star experience that we had paid a lot of money for. 

Around 25 people came to the pool, shouting and making lots of noise. The babies were in the pool without nappies, which made us not want to use it! People were stood at the end of our sunbeds taking photos and selfies which made us feel very uncomfortable (I don’t particularly want to be in peoples photos in my bikini!!). In the end we gave up and went up to the room. 

In the evening on arrival at the restaurant, gone was the relaxed, intimate atmosphere of the night previous. This was replaced by large groups of locals and an awful singer opting for the Enrique Iglesias classics! We were shown to our table and told ‘it’s a buffet’ before the lady walked off. Slightly confused, we went and got a plate of food before asking one of the waiters why is it a buffet now instead of a la carte like the previous evening? He advised because the hotel was now at full occupancy, but if we’d asked for the a la carte menu then we could of had it. Bit late now, so we ate our buffet food which was quite frankly cold and not great. They then bring the bill, over £30 for the cold buffet and a bottle of water!! When I enquired about the price I was told ‘you should of asked how much it was before you ate!’ Seeing as my husband had enjoying a delicious 5-course set menu the night before for just under £12, I certainly didn’t expect an awful buffet to come in at £30! 

Needless to say, we were really disappointed with our last day/evening here, and were glad to be leaving the next day. If you’re looking for a relaxing, 5 star experience, I would not recommend staying here on a weekend.","Disappointing","2019-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r726346163-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

I did the same process for same money in a different hotel in that area previous night, that hotel provided us a big room with double bed and 2 single beds, so start was not that impressive. Also we noticed facilities are getting outdated, furniture was old, very tiny space to make a cup of coffee etc. Other main drawback was, there is no privacy when you shower since there is no door to shower cubicle or toilet.

Few things i have noticed during the meals no one come and check the satisfaction even any managers around and there is no salt and pepper on the tables and funny thing is dinner buffet seafood paella they made with steam rice. Hotel room is super clean and tidy. Overall good facilities and good experience i would recommend this place for others.","Needs to more improved","2019-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r710556701-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The Sheraton is a ""Premium"" category hotel and second only to ""Luxury"" branded Ritz-Carlton & JW Marriot. It is popular among millions of international travellers & acts as a point of convergence & connection. Hence I thought of entertaining my sister & her family from abroad for a dinner at the Colombo Kitchen, which is the main buffet restaurant. Candidly speaking, I was not impressed by the spread, the optics, the taste, service & the ambience.
I patronised this establishment once in 2024 after it was officially opened in December 2023 & the differences were quite obvious! Loved the roast chicken, the honey glazed pork, the beef stew, the sea food & the stir-fried noodles. Most of the other dishes including soups, desserts, & salads lacked finesse & taste. Surprisingly, almost all the dishes had an Arabian or a Middle Eastern spin to them! The pasta dish was not properly seasoned & the Chinese beef dish was a major disappointment. The spread on offer was clearly limited.
The staff was attentive & swift in responding to our requests. However, the buffet, when compared with the others in Colombo, was over-priced. There is much to improve & I hope that Sheraton Colombo will address the above concerns & maintain consistent standards!","The Colombo Kitchen","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12079973-r1007908865-Sheraton_Colombo_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Firstly, we would like to thank you for taking your time to write this detailed review. We take constructive criticism very positively as we believe it truly helps us as a young hotel to reach the high standards we have set for ourselves. We pride ourselves on maintaining the highest possible levels of cleanliness. Our staff is meticulous when it comes to throughly cleaning the rooms are our guests are in on a daily basis. So we would like to sincerely apologise if there was a lapse in the cleanliness and we can assure you that this was an isolated case. However, with regards to your comment about not having a shower or washroom by the pool,  we would like to point out that there indeed is a washroom right next to the swimming pool. We are sorry that you missed out on it, and we will inform our staff to inform our guests about its presence in the future. Furthermore, with regards to your complaint about not providing driver accommodation, we can assure you that no hotel in Sri Lanka, at our price range at least, provides driver accommodation free of charge. However, we will look in to this matter for the future. 

However, we are extremely pleased to hear that our staff was able to meet the standards you expected at Riff Hikkaduwa. We are also delighted to see that you enjoyed the view from your room, and our efforts towards being an eco-friendly hotel.

The Riff is clearly *trying* to be a 5* destination hotel, but apart from the price, it’s just not there. Having come here for a night on our way to Colombo from the Anantara in Tangalle, it was obvious that the owners here have spent some time at the Anantara and tried to mimic certain elements of the resort - from the water bottles to the exact same toiletries - however the lack of experience shows when it comes to the all-important small touches, which are ultimately what makes a hotel stand out.

To highlight a few pro’s and con’s;
- We were the only room not occupied by part of a large Russian group who completely took over the hotel - from the sun loungers, to the pool, to even having Russian music playing at breakfast, which we found very intimidating and created an uncomfortable atmosphere. Had we been contacted by the hotel in advance and pre-warned about the large group we would have sought to stay elsewhere.
- There’s no shower or bathroom by the pool, which means you have no choice but to traipse sand through the pool, hotel and your room.
- Overall cleanliness was not up to scratch (as per my pictures). I would expect a hotel of this age and rating to be spotless.
- There are flies EVERYWHERE - it actually made sitting by the pool impossible. We didn’t experience this anywhere else in Sri Lanka.
- We had an adjoining room, which meant we could hear every sound from our extremely noisy neighbours. 
- The toilet situation is a classic case of style over substance - I don’t believe that anyone, no matter how close you may be, wants to see anyone else on the toilet!
- Also oddly the light switches in the bathroom didn’t work unless the main light in the bedroom was on - which clearly caused some issues in the night.
- They don’t provide any driver accommodation - again, all hotels charging these rates in Sri Lanka should (and had done up until this point).
- As far as the positives go, the staff were very prompt and friendly, it was clear they were trying very hard to please.
- Our room also had a fantastic view (although Hikkaduwa beach itself was probably our least favourite of our trip).
- The complimentary (glass) water bottles were a nice touch and contribution to avoiding plastic in the resort.

Overall I would say that the hotel has the looks but lacks the substance or depth to make it a luxury experience, and therefore we wouldn’t chose to stay again.","Disappointing Riff ","2019-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r669651742-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The most grating was the lack of privacy in the bathroom, including the toilet, due to the use of full length glass doors which looked directly into the rest of the room. We were travelling in a group of 3 and every time one needed privacy in the toilet or bathroom, a full length, cloth Roman blind had to be laboriously wound down and then up. It was time consuming and an unnecessary design. Another annoyance was the fact that there were no pillow cases on the pillows when we arrived. This was quickly rectified. The linen, although it was fresh, still had some grubby marks on it, maybe the beds were made with dirty hands? The staff at breakfast seemed a little put out by our presence, but in their defence, this was possibly because they seemed to be run off their feet, with only two people serving in the whole restaurant. The place mats were grubby and dirty dishes and napkins were not removed. With the gripes finished, I’ll get on to the positives. The reception staff on arrival and departure were very pleasant and friendly. The hotel appears to be newish and has a lovely outlook onto the beach with a beautiful pool in between the building and the beach. The rooms are well equipped and we appreciated the free UHT milk in the fridge to use with tea and coffee.

We strive to serve with a level of excellence where a guest will leave with memories that will bring them back to us again. However, we note that you have not enjoyed the experience we had to offer. Thank you for your  feedback. 

However, we would like to share with you the following: The Garden room has never been advertised as a room with the view of the pool but instead it is clearly said that it has a garden view and is priced accordingly. Furthermore we have mentioned on all the websites that the Garden room is close to common areas and guest can experience noise.   The open concept comes from vernacular architecture and we ensure that the property is in pristine condition and is maintained thoroughly to ensure insects and bugs found in a tropical country does not enter the rooms. There are no scorpions we guarantee unless you plan to explore the forests of Sri Lanka. Mosquitoes are controlled with necessary vaporizes and oils.
With regards to the rest of the observations made by you we were certainly surprised from the comment about the dog, to the inadequate sun beds, to us actually promoting the villa for mere dollars over our in house guest and to the lighting etc., We will accept it with the right service attitude and endevour to take all mentioned constructively and use it towards bettering our standards and continuously achieving the excellence our guests look for.

However, there a few things that were not in sync with the quality and luxury touch presented on the website:

1. The so called garden room is NOT in front of the swimming pool with a view, it is behind the reception desk and directly on the main street with a small patio to bring some light. The bathroom is opened on this patio (no wall!), welcoming all kind of bugs, scorpions and mosquitos inside. You have to carefully close the bathroom door to avoid an invasion in the room. The main street in VERY noisy all day and till late in the night with buses, trucks, tu-tuks and motorbikes roaring and honking, impossible to sleep or rest without earplugs. Not my way of enjoying holidays.

2. The owner's old dog is walking aroud the property, begging for food at the breakfast table, then satisfiying its natural needs in the lawn just in front of your table, good appetite!

3. Ther is NO shade in the garden after 10:00 AM and only a few sunbeds on the beach with an umbrella for 5 rooms....only that you have to share them also with EXTERNAL guests that can order a drink and then use the sunbeds for he whole afternoon, whereas you paid a room at this place and have no place to lay??? Strange policy just to make a few dollars more during the day.

4. In the evening, it is difficult to pick a place for dinner outside, because the air is saturated with kerosene smell from the numerous ""candles"" all across the beach and the garden. What about solar lamps or natural candles in a nice glass cover, romantic and not so smelly?

5. The 2 rooms on the ground floor have a private terrace, but NO privacy: from the pool, guests are looking directly inside your room, and staff is passing in front to acces storage rooms located on the external side of the villa. If you pick one of these rooms, you will have to keep the curtains closed at all times.

An in all, if you want to stay at this place, you have to book only one of the 2 upper roomds with a balcony. It should solve most of the inconvenience and offer you a place to satay in the afternoon if you are not fan of baking in the sun!","Nice villa but difficult to sleep at night in the garden room","2019-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d9981492-r651050820-Villa_Saffron_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We are disappointed but not at all surprised that you did not mention the incident that occurred that resulted in you being annoyed and thus leading to this bad review and calling our villa “a beautiful prison”. We will address the points in your review but first we shall address the main issue here, which was we did not permit you to bring in a non resident guest to your bedroom on your last night. On 7th January, your last night, you returned to the villa after a night out at around 11pm by tuk tuk. All other guests and staff members were in their rooms with the exception of our butler, Isuru who was waiting up for you. Our 24 hour security team (outsourced to a security company) called our Senior Villa Manager, George and informed him there was a problem that required his attention. He immediately came up to find our butler (Isuru), security guards, your tuk tuk driver and yourself. You informed him that you wanted the driver to come up to your room to which he informed you that we are a resident only villa and guests have to be registered. Your tuk tuk driver informed George that he was your husband and the father of your child. As it was evident that our team did not believe this lie, you then said he was your travel agent. George informed you that you were more than welcome to speak in the living and dining area (our lounge) but we could not permit him to go upstairs. He explained that we have a strict resident only policy (which is made clear on our website) and this is also for the security and privacy of all guests, including yourself and your child. 
This was not acceptable to your driver. He became aggressive with our entire team and attempted to blackmail George with threats of a bad review. This was confirmed by our independent security team in addition to George. Our security team have also stated in their report that the individual is a tuk tuk driver who works for a hotel nearby. The hotel has confirmed this. 
Villa Sielen Diva is a family run villa and have been operating since 2018. We have been fortunate to be a part of many beautiful moments in our guests’ lives from birthdays, proposals, anniversaries, weddings and family gatherings. Our guests are entitled to make whatever choices they choose, we respect this but not to the potential risks of the safety of our other guests and staff. In the past, sole female travelers have chosen our villa precisely because of our high standards in guests safety. As readers of this review will appreciate, hotels (in particular, small hotels), can be held hostage to the threat of bad reviews, however we will not compromise on our security standards.

Addressing your comments in your review. Cappuccino is available and our records show that you had it during breakfast with coconut milk. Should you have wanted more salt and pepper, you were more than welcome to ask one of the butlers. We would be grateful to understand what ingredients were missing from your avocado toast as it is a standard and popular order which our chefs make daily. Our chefs follow a set recipe so please do let us know what was missing. We serve our poached eggs with runny yolk but should you have wanted a firmer yolk, again, you were more than welcome to inform the butler and our chefs would have prepared a new order. It is a shame you did not inform any of our team members of this during your 4 night stay with us. Fresh towels are provided daily for guests however if you hang your towels up, our housekeeping team assume you would like to reuse your towel, as a standard practice in hotels worldwide. This is also stated in the note next to the towels. There are 2 windows in your bedroom that can be opened. They are not locked and you simply need to turn the handle down to open. It is a simple mechanism which is similar to a door. We do not understand why you could not open it but again, it is a shame you did not mention this during your stay as our team would have been happy to show you how to open the windows. 
Ms. Sandra, you are well aware that we had no problems with you organising your own transportation. Most of our guests travel with their cars and drivers and make independent arrangements. The issue that we had was you wanting to bring your driver to your bedroom on your last night stay with us. We can only assume you understood our stance and thus the reason you did not make reference to it in your review. 
We wish you and your little boy safe travels and hope he has recovered from his illness.

Sehr geehrte Frau Sandra,
Wir sind enttäuscht, aber keineswegs überrascht, dass Sie den Vorfall nicht erwähnt haben, der dazu geführt hat, dass Sie verärgert waren und daher zu dieser schlechten Bewertung geführt haben und unsere Villa als „ein wunderschönes Gefängnis“ bezeichnet haben. Wir werden auf die Punkte in Ihrer Bewertung eingehen, aber zuerst werden wir uns mit dem Hauptproblem befassen, nämlich dass wir Ihnen nicht gestattet haben, an Ihrem letzten Abend einen nicht im Hotel ansässigen Gast in Ihr Schlafzimmer mitzunehmen. Am 7. Januar, Ihrem letzten Abend, sind Sie nach einer Nacht mit dem Tuk Tuk gegen 23 Uhr in die Villa zurückgekehrt. Alle anderen Gäste und unsere Mitarbeiter befanden sich in ihren Zimmern. Unser 24-Stunden-Sicherheitsteam (ausgelagert an eine Sicherheitsfirma) rief unseren Senior Villa Manager George an und teilte ihm mit, dass ein Problem vorliegt, das seine Aufmerksamkeit erfordert. Er kam sofort herbei, um unsere Sicherheitsleute, Ihren Tuk-Tuk-Fahrer und Sie selbst zu finden. Sie teilten ihm mit, dass Sie wollten, dass der Fahrer zu Ihrem Zimmer kommt, und er teilte Ihnen mit, dass es sich bei uns um eine reine Anwohnervilla handelt und Gäste angemeldet werden müssen. Ihr Tuk-Tuk-Fahrer teilte George mit, dass er Ihr Ehemann und Vater Ihres Kindes sei. Da es offensichtlich war, dass unser Team dieser Lüge nicht glaubte, sagten Sie, er sei Ihr Reisebüro. George teilte Ihnen mit, dass Sie gerne im Wohn- und Essbereich (unserer Lounge) sprechen könnten, wir konnten ihm jedoch nicht erlauben, nach oben zu gehen. Er erklärte, dass wir eine strikte Richtlinie nur für Anwohner haben (die auf unserer Website deutlich gemacht wird) und dass dies auch der Sicherheit und Privatsphäre aller Gäste, einschließlich Ihnen und Ihrem Kind, dient.
Dies war für Ihren Fahrer nicht akzeptabel. Er wurde gegenüber unserem gesamten Team aggressiv und versuchte, George mit der Drohung einer schlechten Bewertung zu erpressen. Dies wurde zusätzlich zu George von unserem unabhängigen Sicherheitsteam bestätigt. Unser Sicherheitsteam hat in seinem Bericht auch angegeben, dass es sich bei der Person um einen Tuk-Tuk-Fahrer handelt, der für ein Hotel in der Nähe arbeitet. Das Hotel hat dies bestätigt.
Villa Sielen Diva ist eine familiengeführte Villa und wird seit 2018 betrieben. Wir hatten das Glück, an vielen schönen Momenten im Leben unserer Gäste teilzuhaben, von Geburtstagen, Heiratsanträgen, Jubiläen, Hochzeiten und Familientreffen. Unsere Gäste haben das Recht, die von ihnen gewählten Entscheidungen zu treffen. Wir respektieren dies, jedoch nicht die potenziellen Risiken für die Sicherheit unserer anderen Gäste und Mitarbeiter. In der Vergangenheit haben sich ausschließlich weibliche Reisende für unsere Villa entschieden, gerade wegen unserer hohen Ansprüche an die Sicherheit unserer Gäste. Wie die Leser dieser Rezension zu schätzen wissen, können Hotels (insbesondere kleine Hotels) der Bedrohung durch schlechte Bewertungen ausgesetzt sein, wir werden jedoch bei unseren Sicherheitsstandards keine Kompromisse eingehen.

Berücksichtigen Sie Ihre Kommentare in Ihrer Rezension. Cappuccino ist verfügbar und unseren Aufzeichnungen zufolge haben Sie ihn beim Frühstück mit Kokosmilch getrunken. Sollten Sie noch mehr Salz und Pfeffer gewünscht haben, konnten Sie gerne einen der Butler fragen. Wir wären Ihnen dankbar, wenn Sie erfahren würden, welche Zutaten in Ihrem Avocado-Toast gefehlt haben, da es sich um eine standardmäßige und beliebte Bestellung handelt, die unsere Köche täglich zubereiten. Unsere Köche befolgen ein festgelegtes Rezept. Teilen Sie uns daher bitte mit, was gefehlt hat. Wir servieren unsere pochierten Eier mit flüssigem Eigelb. Sollten Sie jedoch ein festeres Eigelb gewünscht haben, können Sie dies gerne dem Butler mitteilen, und unsere Köche hätten dann eine neue Bestellung vorbereitet. Es ist schade, dass Sie während Ihres 4-tägigen Aufenthalts bei uns keinem unserer Teammitglieder darüber informiert haben. Täglich werden den Gästen frische Handtücher zur Verfügung gestellt. Wenn Sie Ihre Handtücher jedoch aufhängen, geht unser Reinigungsteam davon aus, dass Sie Ihr Handtuch gerne wiederverwenden möchten, wie es in Hotels weltweit üblich ist. Dies steht auch im Hinweis neben den Handtüchern. In Ihrem Schlafzimmer gibt es 2 Fenster, die geöffnet werden können. Sie sind nicht verriegelt und Sie müssen zum Öffnen lediglich den Griff nach unten drehen. Es handelt sich um einen einfachen Mechanismus, der einer Tür ähnelt. Wir verstehen nicht, warum Sie es nicht öffnen konnten, aber auch hier ist es schade, dass Sie dies während Ihres Aufenthalts nicht erwähnt haben, da unser Team Ihnen gerne gezeigt hätte, wie man die Fenster öffnet.
Frau Sandra, Sie wissen sehr wohl, dass wir keine Probleme damit hatten, dass Sie Ihren Transport selbst organisieren konnten. Die meisten unserer Gäste reisen mit ihrem Auto und Fahrer und treffen ihre Reise selbständig. Das Problem, das wir hatten, war, dass Sie Ihren Fahrer bei Ihrem letzten Aufenthalt bei uns in Ihr Schlafzimmer bringen wollten. Wir können nur davon ausgehen, dass Sie unseren Standpunkt und damit den Grund verstanden haben, warum Sie in Ihrer Bewertung nicht darauf Bezug genommen haben.
Wir wünschen Ihnen und Ihrem kleinen Jungen eine gute Reise und hoffen, dass er sich von seiner Krankheit erholt hat.","2016","725537367","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/57/caption.jpg","1512","2016","725537364","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/54/caption.jpg","1512","2016","725537365","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/55/caption.jpg","1512","2016","725537368","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/58/caption.jpg","1512","2016","725537366","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/56/caption.jpg","1512","2016","725537370","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/5a/caption.jpg","1512","1512","725537371","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/5b/caption.jpg","2016","1512","725537369","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3e/d2/59/caption.jpg","2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd, Talpe 80615 Sri Lanka","Talpe","Sri Lanka","80615",," 776/1 Galle-Matara Coastal Rd",,"15050754","5.998871","Talpe, Galle District, Southern Province","80.270584","Sielen Diva","208","4.9","4","0","1","6","197","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3198032-d15050754-Reviews-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.sielendiva.com/","2024-01-18","OTHER","3",,"Value","2","Location","5","Service","3",,,,,,,"Das Hotel ist von der Einrichtung sehr schön und entspricht dem 5 Sterne Standards. Allerdings ist das Personal gleich unbeholfen wie in Hotels mit weniger Sternen. Ich war während meines Aufenthalts in Sri Lanka in 7 verschiedenen Hotels und habe die Erfahrung gemacht, dass das 5 Sterne Hotel nicht besser, wenn nicht schlechter als einige 4 Sterne Einrichtungen, war. Bsp: Es steht ein Cappuccino auf der Karte, aber sie können ihn nicht zubereiten. Es wird ein Toast mit Avocado und pochiertem Ei serviert, allerdings kein Salz und Pfeffer gereicht und der Toast war mehr ein Weißbrot und Zutaten fehlten, zudem war das Ei nicht richtig gegart. Ich habe es auch nicht bemängelt, sondern nur festgestellt. Viele im Service konnten auch hier kein Englisch - was wie überall zu Chaos führte. Es gab ganz dünne Papierservietten, keine Stoffservietten. Das Hotel verfügt über 7 Zimmer und frische Handtücher waren nicht immer verfügbar. Für mich ist es auch schlimm gewesen, dass man die Fenster nicht öffnen konnte und somit keine frische Luft in den Raum gelangen konnte. Was mich aber am meisten irritiert hatte war, dass man mich angeprangert hat warum ich mich selbst um meinen Transfer gekümmert habe. Ich kann verstehen, dass das Hotel dadurch Einbusen hatte, nur ist es sehr umprofessionell einen Gast mit diesen Belangen zu belasten. Der Manager, namens Santa war sehr freundlich und meiner Meinung nach der erfahrenste Mitarbeiter dort. Er hat sich stets sehr professionell verhalten, was ich über den ""Villa Operations Manager"", George Moses nicht behaupten kann.","durchwachsen - ein schönes Gefängnis!","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3198032-d15050754-r934565696-Sielen_Diva-Talpe_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We booked for a family of 4 through booking.com (having provided the kids ages as 8 and 10). The staff looked genuinely confused when we pointed out that there was only  a double bed and one single bed and we questioned where our other child might sleep. They offered to put another bed in the room for $15 per night and said this was clearly signposted in the booking.com T&C's (we subsequently checked this... There was ZERO mention). There was no hotel information other than here is your WiFi code and the key. A morning jog informed me there was a whole other pool and a morning yoga class.

Thank you for your feedback. We're pleased you enjoyed the spacious rooms, beautiful setting, pool area, and the entertainment at the bar.

We apologize for the inconvenience regarding the distance of your rooms from the main area and the dim lighting along the pathways since we are a nature resort, we are using minimum lights to not to disturb to the nature. We understand this can be challenging, especially after a long day. We will look into improving the lighting and consider room placement in the future. We are glad you enjoyed the buffet and other aspects of your stay.

We appreciate your recommendation and hope to welcome your back, perhaps with a room closer to the main complex.

Sincerely,

Tharindu Ekanayake

Pros
The hotel is beautiful and have made in a way that it blends well with the nature. 
Lots of activities to do. There are boat rides, special tours to sigiriya and Minneriya National park (you need to pay extra though)
Food is good! 
Great service! Everyone at the hotel is really nice, warm and supportive. They are ready to go above and beyond to ensure that everything goes smooth. 

Cons
The water is a little brackish - which is common in the area. 
Main areas feel a little warm because there’s no AC. Was sweating a lot in the common areas like reception, buffet area. 

I think I can give about 7/10 for the entire hotel and its amenities. 8/10 for food.  But definitely a 10/10 for the service. 

The rooms are pretty normal in size. Has a minibar and a tv. 
We went to Minneriya National Park which is about 5 mins away from the hotel. There were lots of elephants and foxes. Good experience! 

Tip:
If you are going in the boat ride, go at about 5pm - the view is mesmerizing! 

Suggestion to the hotel:
Had a hard time finding the way (back to room, lunch area, lake etc. Would be better if you can implement more signs and maps around the area)","Good stay - pick your season carefully!

I dont no maybe GM bad mood that day. But no body care that. He's working for tourism industry and need to be presentable & professional on duty.

We weren't shown around the other villas, to see the wonderful pool and the lovely dining area, which would have bee easy as they have their own three wheelers. So we sat in our room feeling rather let down. It was a large lovely room but balcony looked out over three wheeler park at the side and gas storage at the back. No seats, table or loungers on the balcony and certainly not the wonderful hilltop views we had expected. We asked if we could be moved to a hilltop room, helpful but slightly hesitant staff said they's get back to us. We were offered a hilltop room the next day but had a large tree outside the balcony which blocked most of the wonderful view !. We assumed the other hilltop rooms must be full so don't say anything. As it happened they all remained empty ( in Mango Villa ) for our remaining three days. Mystified by all the great ratings about food. The set menu we had was European, the pork chops for the main were very dry and tough, like flavoured cardboard. We asked for Sri Lankan food for the rest of our stay - we got moussaka the next night !!?? Finally got Sri Lankan for the remaining two night. The most disappointing aspect of this wonderful location was that throughout our four day stay the manager was not seen to talk to any guests at any time. Every evening he came to eat at his own table, on his own,  in the dining area and ignored everyone. He sat looking at his phone or talking on it, ate his food and left without acknowledging any guests.I rate him as a completely disinterested manager. Finally I want to explain I'm retired and have travelled all my life. I've never written a negative review or  written a complaint. However we stayed here, one to two hours drive from the attractions we wanted to visit, because of the great reviews. It was a huge disappointment. There were a few other things but really I put everything down to a sloppy lazy manager.

Many thanks for your comments. 

And I'm specially pleased that you rate our newly recruited Ayurvedic Therapist, Anura, who started earlier than planned so as to provide your requested treatments.  

We regularly check our room and meal prices to make sure they are fully competitive.

Our 4 course Breakfast at US$10 per adult- fruit plate and fruit juice, cereals, toasts and jams, plus a full hot English breakfast, including bacon and sausages-is designed to set our Guests up for an active day.

Our 4 course, Farm Fresh communal supper at US$ 20 per adult includes free water, coffees and teas, which most other hotels charge extra for.

Also we only charge children under 10 years old, half price for their meals; and we offer a 6 pm early supper for them with their choice of favorite foods. Babies under 2 years old eat free.

We were looking for a location to feel at home and comforted. That is a requirement that was not met in Sofia for multiple reasons.

The hotel disappointed us when our initial reservation had an issue with the systems. We managed to make another reservation through their website. While we made a reservation for a Double room (and as it showed in the confirmation we received), the hotel called to claim we made a reservation for a Single room and tried to charge Rs. 3,500. Once confronted with a copy, the reception accepted the error in their website and waived it off.

Secondly, the option for any additions to be charged to the room was not available. Hence all extras had to be paid on the time of consumption. It wasn't an issue until the orders in the pool had at the same feature. This could be avoided maybe a deposit in the start of the stay.

The breakfast buffet really needs attention and care. The service team was far away from attentive as water had to be requested, clearance had to be accepted, hardly any attention to detail on the request. The food quality was average. The pastry was good.

The hotel did have 3 mentions that I have to say were exceptional.

1. The bar which makes some amazing cocktails. The Tuk Tuk with the Ambarella Chutney was WOW. The Vodka Frappe was the same. Both Dilshi & Askar who were in the bar deserve a lot of credit for their work.

2. The Pool Service team was well versed with the work they were doing. They were courteous and did all they could to make our time at the pool enjoyable.

Only problem is that hotel is not so service minded. At check-in I had to leave my passport at the reception desk like I was going to take off without paying (I paid in full already). Also wouldn’t they let us go without checking the room ‘to make sure we didn’t forget any valuables’

In the bar we had to wait for half an hour for our drinks because they forgot which white wine we ordered. 

Trying to get to sleep we couldn’t get the lights off. Maintenance people had to come to our room to fix this. 

Finally we had to make 4 trips to the reception desk to get our room keys fixed.  All together a lot of points that should be addressed. 

On the positive side we were having a final drink in the bar (I had to get rid of my last cash). There Dinendira served some nice cocktails and a cold beer. I wouldn’t mind going back there.","Nice hotel, needs some better service","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27363339-r964482963-Sofia_Colombo_City_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback following your recent stay with us.

We’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the beautiful view from your seaside room and appreciate you highlighting that aspect of your experience.

At the same time, we sincerely regret that our buffet did not fully cater to your dietary needs as a pure vegetarian. Your concern regarding dish labeling and the lack of allergen information is valid, and we are already working with our culinary team to ensure better clarity and distinction of items moving forward.

We also understand your discomfort with the bathroom layout and design. While the intention was to create a modern open-plan feel, we realize that it may not suit all guest preferences — especially when traveling with family. Your feedback is extremely helpful and will be shared with our design and operations teams for future improvements.

Thank you again for your comments. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and offer a more comfortable and personalized experience.

However, I noticed some room for improvement. Since some of the business matters were confidential the privacy given by the staff to the clients could be improved.

Good:
The rooms are awesome, clean and nice.

Bad:
Ayu - their resturant is the worst I have seen in a hotel in Colombo.
Avoid the breakfast or any meal in that case.
While I was having breakfast one morning, one of the staff was arranging the tables and he drop some of the folks, and knives (already arranged on a table for someone to sit there) on the ground.
He silently picked them up and put them back on the table like nothing happen.
I asked him, if it was the right thing to do as someone had to eat with those knives and folks he dropped. He was upset but hesitantly removed one of the knives.
So be aware and this is how they behave while people are around, at the back who knows what standards they follow.

I have tried Ayu few years back and till today the hotel has not changed any of their terrible services.

The rooms were great, really big and very comfortable and the front reception staff were very helpful.  It came apart when we tried to have our evening meal which was included in the room price.  We went to the restaurant and it was basically empty and the customers who were there were complaining to the staff about the service.  We waited a while but when no one came to give us a menu or take a drinks order for nearly 30 minutes, we decided to leave.  We then went up to the roof garden to have a bar meal which was actually pretty good.  The views from the pool/bar area were great but I would not have liked to have been there for more than one night.  It was a shame as we had switched from a different hotel to this one on a recommendation.  I like to think we just got unlucky on that particular night.","Didn't meet expectations","2021-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d11953119-r826274168-Nh_Collection_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",
