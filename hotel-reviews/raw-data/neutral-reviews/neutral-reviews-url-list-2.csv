You were a part of the Noble Caledonian Group and as we advised your local travel agent and your foreign guide, some of the guests were already sick when they checked so it sees rather unfair for you to blame the hotel for this. I spoke to the travel and the foreign guide and clarified hence I will not bother to respond to each and every point mentioned in this review as it would be futile. 

I am sorry you feel this way but thank you nevertheless for staying with us.
Enjoy the rest of your time in Sri Lanka

Initial impressions positive. Villas can be a long way from the hotel buildings. You can be reliant on the electric buggies but if the internal phone, to summonse the buggy, does not work like ours  you have to walk in the rain and dark even with the supplied torch. A major problem is the poor food quality. Restaurant service very slow, plates cold, food cold or tepid even when reheated. All meat dishes very tough and some unedible. It may be coincidence but 75% of our group went down with stomach problems. The villa was nice but we had two water leaks. These were 'solved' by Staff puting towels down. Basin water was only ever tepid including the 'cold' water tap. In view of the poor food quality would not stay here again.","Disappointing Stay Due to Poor Food Quality","2024-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r982451852-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences during your recent stay at our hotel. We greatly value your feedback as it allows us to understand better how we can enhance our services and facilities to meet and exceed guest expectations.

We were disheartened to learn about the issues you encountered regarding the lack of water around your villa and the challenges with room service. Please accept our sincerest apologies for these shortcomings. As you have very correctly pointed out, April is indeed the hottest month of the year in sunny Sri Lanka and due to a prolonged drought, most of the water ways, lakes and ponds that are synonymous with Water Garden Sigiriya, tend to dry up until the rains arrive. Rest assured, we will investigate these matters thoroughly and take necessary actions to prevent such occurrences in the future.

Regarding the pool area, we acknowledge your concern about the lack of shade, especially considering the high temperatures in April. We will review our current arrangements and explore options to provide adequate shade for guests who prefer cooler environments. We do apologize for not meeting your expectations in this regard.

On a more positive note, we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your spa experience and the cuisine on offer. These aspects of your stay highlight the areas where we excel, and we are committed to maintaining and improving these services. Please rest assured that your feedback has been taken very seriously, and we are implementing measures to address the issues you have raised. We sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to providing exceptional hospitality.

Once again, thank you for bringing these matters to our attention. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the future, where we hope to offer you an experience that truly reflects our dedication to excellence.

Unfortunately due to the lack of rain our villa was actually over a dried mud bed and not water and the outside had the smell of stagnant water. Our butler was delightful but due to heat and an early start we decided to have room service. It took over 24hrs for these plates to be cleared from outside our room and not before the insects stepped in. Room service seemed to think it was the restaurants responsibility - eventually our butler took them away but not what you expect from a 5* hotel. 
Equally the pool had been created with an incredible view but zero shade and as April is the hottest month it was impossible to use and extremely hot!
The spa was a lovely experience and the food was good but I would be loathed to recommend this hotel for the price per night.","Overpriced and underwhelming.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r956190110-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

I hope this message finds you well and I wanted to personally reach out to address your concerns. Upon reviewing your comments, I noticed something unusual. There hasn't been any construction activity on our premises and this leads me to believe there might have been a misunderstanding or perhaps a mix-up with another establishment. It's possible that the review was intended for a different location.

To better assist you and to ensure we're addressing your concerns accurately, could you please confirm whether you stayed at our hotel? Any additional details about your stay, such as the dates or specific rooms you occupied, would be greatly appreciated.

We take great pride in providing exceptional service and maintaining high standards of cleanliness and comfort for our guests. Your experience should reflect these values, and I assure you that we will do everything within our power to rectify any issues you encountered.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I can be reached on gm@watergardensigiriya.com. I look forward to hearing from you.

Firstly let me take this opportunity to thank you for having selected to stay at Water Garden Sigiriya and to be very honest with you, I am sincerely upset to read that your stay with us did not meet your expectations. As the majority of our online reviews will testify, we pride ourselves on providing a memorable experience to all our guests and it is indeed extremely disheartening to learn that you did not experience the same for some very strange reason. 

When you stay in a hotel and if you are dissatisfied with a certain product or service, then it is your right as a paying customer to bring this to the attention of the Manager or anyone else in authority who can address the issue and provide you with a solution. Sadly and again for some very strange reason you did not do so yet you decided to pen your thoughts post your stay thus denying us the opportunity to clarify and set the record straight while you were resident with us.  

At this point I feel it is my duty, as the General Manager of the hotel, to 'clarify' some negative points raised by you purely for the benefit of all future guests who plan to visit us; 

1. I am delighted that you liked the structure of the reception pavilion, the many exotic birds on site including the hundreds of wandering peacocks and peahens, the enormous main swimming pool with stunning views of the Lion Rock and the staffing in the main restaurant.  As you have suggested, I will indeed take a deep and long look at the negative concerns you have raised and will take corrective action should I find the need to do so.  To further clarify;

2. As the name signifies, there are many water bodies on site in the form of ponds, lakes and water ways. There are many marine eco systems thriving in these water bodies not to mention hundreds of fish who eat the larvae of the mosquitoes and who have a zero chance of breeding in our water bodies. 

3. There are 4 resident mugger crocodiles in the main lake at the entrance of the hotel and we have built custom made islands for them to bask in the sun and regulate their body temperatures. The many water bodies are thriving with hundreds of local lake fish however fishing by humans is banned within the property as these fish are part of a food chain for the many species of birds and mugger crocs. The crocodiles I can guarantee you are restricted to the main lake and they do not wander around the property during the day or night seeking potential humans to devour.  

4. The hotel is set in 38 acres of landscaped gardens and waterways. As was explained to you by your butler during the hotel and villa orientation, we have electric golf buggies which are on call at any given time to drive you from one location to another. Given the fact that we are located within a jungle environment, all guests are advised to refrain from walking on the pathways at night despite the fact that all walking paths are sufficiently illuminated from dusk to dawn.   

5. I have spoken to and investigated this water issue with all our butlers and none of them can recall such a request. Bottles of water are usually delivered to the villas by the Housekeeping team and I do apologise if you did not receive your request due to a miscommunication on our part.   
    
6. The main gates of the hotel are kept closed at all times as we do not allow non-resident guests to enter the hotel as a policy. The reason for this being to safeguard the comfort and privacy of all our resident guests which included yourselves when you were staying with us. I am confident that you and future guests will appreciate this policy. 

Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention via this review but what would have been a win-win situation for yourselves and us is if you had raised these concerns either with me or any other Manager during your stay. 

Nevertheless, thank you for this visit and do enjoy the rest of your time in Sri Lanka. 

With sunny regards from Sigiriya.

It features 30 comfortably furnished one bedroom villas -many with private plunge pools -that encircle a manmade “water garden”.  But the “water garden” itself is a string of stagnant water holes that serve as magnets for mosquitoes and are filled with crocodiles (!) – or so we were cautioned by staff  - which made walking around the poorly lit property especially precarious at night. 

Arrival at the hotel, past the locked gate and exquisitely designed reception pavillion,is spectacular. But the reception itself is chilly and devoid of charm. Such a shame. The hotel’s jungle like setting attracts many exotic birds; including enormous peacocks we enjoyed watching take flight. The main swimming pool is enormous and beautiful; as is the dining room, which is staffed with well-meaning and attentive waiters. But the rest of hotel is in serious need of better trained -  and happier - staff. For example, the “butler” we were assigned refused to help us obtain mineral water. He volunteered to take us back and forth to the dining room in the hotel’s golf cart but kept us waiting over a half hour each time. Housekeeping was sloppy. Among the many hotels we stayed in wonderful Sri Lanka, Water Garden Sirigiya was the only one in which we sensed management did not treat or train its household staff well.","Spectacular View But Devoid of Charm","2024-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d10416524-r938692407-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

I understand that you are one of the guests who was travelling with Mr Michael Williams as the content of your review is indeed similar to the review posted by Katherine. 

First and foremost, we want to express our sincere apologies for any inconveniences or disappointments you encountered during your time at our hotel. Your stated experiences certainly do not reflect the level of service and quality we strive to provide to all our valued guests hence kindly permit me to clarify;

Regarding the dinner experience, we regret if you found the service slow and the food not to your taste. We understand that you did not express your dissatisfaction during the dinner meal, and we apologize for any missed opportunities to rectify the situation promptly. Your valuable feedback will be shared with our culinary team to ensure that all guests' dietary preferences are catered to effectively.

Regarding the lack of signage to the villas, we apologize for any confusion you experienced. We do provide golf buggies that are available 24/7 as was communicate during the check in process. I understand that your driver had dropped off all 10 of you near the villas upon your return to the hotel and not at the main entrance where all the buggies are on standby. We will reinforce this communication to all guests and drivers in future.

Regarding the handling of complaints, I regret if any explanation/clarification on my part was perceived as defensive. It definitely was not my intention. However, I do apologize for not waiving off the main course charge of the entire group as we saw no valid reason to do so. Our intention is always to resolve guest concerns promptly and professionally, and we apologize if we were misunderstood.

In conclusion, we deeply regret that your experience at our hotel was not up to par with your expectations and we do appreciate your candid feedback.

Once again, thank you for sharing your feedback. We value your patronage and hope that you will give us another opportunity to provide you with the true five-star experience we are known for.

Unfortunately, the staff — while kind — was not sufficiently well trained for a resort of this caliber. Service was slow at the front desk, in the bar, and in the restaurant. The food at the restaurant was mediocre at best. The villas — while beautifully appointed — did not function well: misaligned doors throughout, insufficient outside lighting, inconsistent lighting controls, water temps that were tepid at maximum, poorly designed door locks, incomprehensible phone system, etc. The property also lacks signage throughout. At night, especially, it was difficult to find or follow paths to the villas without lighting or signs. This is dangerous in a location where we were warned at check-in about crocodiles at night! Using the offered golf cart transport to the villas at night is a must until proper signage and lighting are installed.

Compared to the other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka, Water Garden Sigiriya was the only disappointment.

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for choosing to stay at Water Garden Sigiriya. We value all feedback from our guests as it allows us to continuously improve and provide exceptional experiences.

We are disappointed to hear that the service fell short of your expectations with certain aspects of your recent stay and it deeply concerns us that our service was not perceived as matching your expectations. We would like to clarify that we take great pride in our consistent efforts to maintain high standards and live up to not only our past but also the very recent glowing accolades and top rating which we have been enjoying to date. However, opinions do tend to vary from one customer to another.  

To clarify;

With regard to your comparison to other hotels, we understand that individual preferences can vary. We pride ourselves on offering a unique and exceptional experience for our guests, and while we acknowledge that other properties in Sri Lanka may offer different price points, it is essential to remember that each establishment has its own distinct offerings and ambiance.

I was alerted to the incident with regard to your dinner on the first night and although I tried to meet you the next day, it seems that you were out on safari the entire day and came late to the hotel. Regarding the issue with the spice level of the devilled Beef ordered by you and the hot butter Cuttlefish ordered by your wife, based on my instructions the Restaurant Manager offered to replace the dishes with spicier versions to your liking. However, we did respect your decision to decline our replacement offer and we also decided to waive off the 2 dishes in question as you both had expressed dissatisfaction. Unfortunately as requested by you, we saw no reason to waive off the charges of all the other 7 main courses consumed by the rest of your party as none of them had expressed dissatisfaction either during or after the meal. 

I personally find the comparison with the hilarious 1970s British Sitcom ""Fawlty Towers,"" a rather biased  exaggeration and am truly saddened that you think so. We take immense pride in our professional and dedicated staff who consistently aim to provide the highest level of service. All our reviews on Tripadvisor, both past and recent will validate the fact that we have consistently been number One in the region.

We genuinely regret that your stay with us did not meet your expectations. Please be assured that we take all feedback seriously, and we are continually working to enhance our services and facilities to create exceptional experiences for all our guests. I normally would not go to such detail in responding but since the intention is to alert fellow travelers, I thought I should address all points so as not to mislead.

As you mentioned to me upon departure, two members of your group have expressed reviews of a similar nature and we anticipate that the remainder to follow will be of a similar nature. I will respond to them all as appropriate.

Thank you again for sharing your thoughts with us. 
Yours sincerely

On the other aspects commented on in the review we wish to clarify for reasons of clarity. 

All Villas have two sets of slippers, one is a disposable bio-degradable fabric slipper for use indoors & the other a rubber flip flop for use outdoors which is not disposable, this is sanitised & placed after use. 
Replacing the rubber flip flops after every use will not be an environmentally responsible practice. However if a request had been made for a new pair we would have gladly obliged. 
We do not place worn out old slippers under any circumstances. 

On the laundry bag what we have is a durable cotton fabric bag with our logo which is laundered & reused, here again as an environmental best practice we do not use plastic disposable bags. 
The probable reason for the comment could be the fact that an offer of a different bag to take away your dirty laundry on you departure was made by our staff in a polite manner. 

We do regret the incident where the security at the gate had questioned you on the bikes which were being carried away in your vehicle as he had wanted to verify that they were not bikes that belonged to the resort. 
The security was merely doing his duty and had been very polite about the matter. You would probably recall that the General Manager who was there at that time had apologised profusely & we apologise once more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Indigaswewa, Sigiriya 21120 Sri Lanka","Sigiriya","Sri Lanka","21120",,"Indigaswewa",,"10416524","7.992871","Sigiriya, Central Province","80.745834","Water Garden Sigiriya","1176","4.9","4","3","16","75","1078","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304141-d10416524-Reviews-Water_Garden_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html","http://www.watergardensigiriya.com","2018-04-01","OTHER","3","Beautiful place if there is water","Rooms","5","Location","5","Service","5",,,,,,,"I enjoyed both my stays here but the place is struggling.

We do appreciate candid feedback from our guest as this is what assists us in serving you our guest better, however there are some aspects of the review which we feel needs clarification.

The villa you stayed in initially did not have a view of a swamp but was of the resorts rice paddy field & the reeds you saw on the water is part of the natural vegetation.

The superior deluxe villa with it’s own plunge pool which you were upgraded to with no extra cost is a category of  accommodation rated high by most if not all our guest, we are surprised that it was not to your expectations, we do apologize for the temporary glitch in your shower that was rectified immediately but we went ahead with an upgrade to a villa of a higher category than the one you had booked.

We are somewhat surprised with the comment of limited choices on the set menu, it is a four course menu with a choice of 4 main courses & 3 desserts which is many more options than in most set menus, there are choices on the other courses too, in the event one is not content with the options offered we as a practice & policy would be more than glad to specially prepare food to meet ones individual requirement .

The glass shards in the carpet too is a comment that’s puzzling as it was investigated in detail, the probable cause for the mild indentation on the upper part of your foot & not the sole when you removed your socks was probably caused by the minute sand or quartz particles which were found in your presence which were not glass shards..

Thank you for having stayed with us, compliments of the season & warm wishes

- very spacious rooms including one living room we have never used.
- nice environment surrounded with rice paddies and with peacocks, monitor lizards, egrets and frogs all around the premises.
- staff very friendly and useful.
- massages were good.

The cons: 
- for 640 USD a night you definitely expect to get something special that deserves the price you pay.
- our room had a view blocked by the reeds and the only water visible was a muddy swamp. 
- the shower was flooding into the rest of the bathroom.
- we found some small glass shards in the carpet.
- restaurant was OK but once again nothing extraordinary. Set menu with limited choices. 

If the management was nice enough to change us to a similar room with a small pool, a better view and a properly working shower we still feel there is something missing to justify this high price.

We understand that atmosphere is important, and the reason we do not play music in our bar and restaurant areas is to allow our guests to fully immerse themselves in the natural beauty and soothing sounds of the ocean. Many of our guests appreciate the peaceful ambiance this creates, but we truly respect that preferences can vary.

Greetings from all of us at Jetwing Saman Villas, and thank you for taking the time to write a wonderful and informative review of the property during your night’s stay at the resort.

On reading your review, we also understand that you were not very pleased with our hospitality and the food that is served at the resort, and I do apologise on behalf of the team for any inconvenience that may have been caused to you.

At the resort, the usual practise is to collect payment for the stay on arrival if payment has not been made prior to arrival; however, according to your statement, it seemed that this process was handled in an unprofessional manner, which may have caused you some inconvenience, and please accept our apologies in this regard as well.

I have also shared your comments with our chef, who’s been with us for quite a while, to look into the reasons as to what may have gone wrong with almost all your dishes, which you have mentioned in your review.

We do appreciate your thoughts and opinions mentioned in your review, and we thank you for addressing these areas with us so we can look into it. 

We also take this opportunity to thank you for choosing Jetwing Saman Villas for a night’s stay and sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity to serve you better and visit us again in the near future.

Room has a very quality sound system but you can not connect through bluetooth to phone . It has a cofee machine but no choice is you are Tea person. Room and bedding 5 out of 5. 

Staff experience wasn't the most impressive during my stay , as firstly there were some discrepancies in the price as they initially quoted a low price and ended up with a higher. Our visit was very casual unplanned one but the person at front office was more inquisitive rather than welcoming and strangely he came with a POS machine to charge the fee even before we entered the room . it was quite awkward and unwelcoming. 
Upper level staff more likely intimidating they are overwhelmed and over confident about what they do reluctantly attending the guest concerns. Staff 2 out of 5. 

They have a nice spa and they are generous to offer a 15 min complimentary foot massage. It was very good and the spa setting is pretty nice you feel more calm and free inside. Therapists was Manori and Chamil very polite and very professional, done the massage superbly. It's 5 out of 5. 

Main attention and concern is poor food quality. Unacceptable for boutique villa which has won the islands best boutique Hotel award many times . We selected in room Dining where order Caeser Salad which wasn't in their menu but they undertook it which was very poor presentation and preparation as it was only lettuce soaked in plenty of mayonnaise and one egg, no croutons olive garlic etc . Other worst dish was their Mutton Leg - It was a steamed type of meat chunk no taste at all and the presentation was disgusting, even I doubted its beef instead Mutton, a supervisor came and assured its mutton and they replaced the dish with a Chicken wrap which also wasn't at a good taste, wrap was drenched in sauces no standard at all. Morning Breakfast was a set Menu in for Sri Lankan they offered many items but taste wasn't which expected at a five start hotel . Their black cofee is definitely an espresso too strong for a cofee , when we complained it F&B Manager said this the way we present it by raising his voice. Throughout that attitude of the upper staff was unaccommodating. Minor staff is polite and apologizing. Food was 1 out of 5. 

I wish the Jetwing one of the famous Hoteliers in Sri Lanka will look in to the shortcomings and improve the necessary areas to make Saman Villas stay much comfortable and unforgettable.","BREATHTAKING VIEWS OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA","2023-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r885316655-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Greetings from all of us at Jetwing Saman Villas, and thank you for taking the time to write about your experience on TripAdvisor following your stay at the resort. We appreciate you noting your comments here so we could address them and find ways to prevent shortcomings in the future.

When we looked at the reservation confirmation the hotel sent you, we saw that the reservations team had responded to your email asking for an early check-in. We hope you received this email. And in response to your remarks regarding the tea facility, we would like to note that our hotel has a practice of not providing in-room tea makers; nonetheless, tea is always provided to the room, complimentary upon guest request.

With regards to the dining options, we have a couple of signature dining locations at our property that are specially arranged and therefore require pre-booking. We apologise again that this was not properly communicated to you by my team. I have also shared your comments with our executive chef with regards to the eggs and pastry items, which you felt were not up to standard.

Thank you once again for your feedback, which is very much appreciated by myself and the entire team at Jetwing Saman Villas. We are sincerely sorry to read about all these drawbacks that you experienced and will ensure that these areas are well addressed moving forward.

We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you back and provide you with the service and standards for which Jetwing is most renowned.

Ayubowan! (May you live long)

1. No confirmation of arrival time or acknowledgement of a request for early check-in or check out.
2.  No creamer or tea in the room, just coffee capsules. Took 1.5 hours and 2 calls for a kettle to be brought, and was subsequently told they dont serve tea or creamer and milk had to be ordered through room service. So not Sri Lankan.
3. Minibar fridge was not functioning - Inquiry into it was only met with an acceptance that it isnt working.
4. Requests for special dining by the pool was met with negativity with claims of it needing to be booked prior. Come dinner time and that space was not used by anyone.
5. A very poor eggs benedict - bad muffin, chicken bacon, and dried out apparently hollandaise sauce. 
6. No reply from guest relations despite feedback.

We all are delighted to read that you enjoyed the stunning view and the personalized cooking by Chef and the  natural environment also genuine hospitality delivered by my passionate team.

We are very surprised with the review and rating, especially when over 98% of guests have praised the hotel and rated very good and excellent.

Our rates vary throughout the year. In fact there are 4 different rate periods depending on many factors such as holiday season, weather, festivities, demand, etc.   The cheapest is from April to October and most expensive from  December to  January . 

Reviewer stayed  during  peak period . The room, reviewer selected was deluxe with pool  and it’s a second highest  category room which has highest demand in the year. 
Also, our rate structure is flexible to the extent that a traveler can have a very cheap holiday with special offers during April to October period . 

We regularly compare prices of similar standard hotels so that our prices are in line with similar standard hotels. However, our prices are not higher than any boutique hotel of similar standard in Sri Lanka or elsewhere in the world.

Thank you once again . We look forward to having you back with us at Saman Villas.

The food served were well presented. However, the chicken fillet was overcooked and dry. Something was missing from the dish. Would not order it again.
A chicken burger was well compositioned and well cooked. Would order it again.

The pricing was too much. A beer, for instance, was 4 times pricier than in the surrounding beach shacks and beach side restaurants.

The location of the hotel is very good as it is only 2 hr driver from Colombo airport. the Public beach that is next to the hotel is stunning and endless. so definitely recommend going for a run and a dip in the morning, the beach is raw, full of tiny crabs and if you are lucky enough you might see the occasional turtle on shore.

the hotel is quite old, and not very well maintained, the rooms are quite sad as well and they could do with a major facelift as the property itself is very well situated on top of a rock overlooking the ocean (hence the images from top). so the potential is there to even possibly knock down the entire resort and build a much nicer property on top worth the location.

Saman Villas had major refurbishments in 2004 and 2010.  We generally carry out soft renovations every year, also regular maintenance works continue throughout the year.   All furniture are made of exotic timber varieties, mostly teak and no plastics.  We expose the rich grain and texture of these exotic varieties rather than covering them with black stain or white paint.  Our furniture are cut and polished  periodically. 

Shower gel, shampoo and conditioner are of high quality reputed brands which are tested and cleared as safe for use.  These products are provided in reusable ceramic containers in keeping with the hotel’s responsible tourism principles. We do not provide luxury branded products, unsafe products in misleading 5 star packaging. 
Hair is an important feature of a person’s beauty and personality and your requirement of a shampoo and conditioner may different from what we provide.

Bed linen is changed on daily basis on requests of our guests and the cleanliness and the quality of the linen is maintained up to the standard. If there is a comment on the cleanliness we immediately attend for necessary actions. During the stay of the reviewer there has been no any complain about dirty linen or request for a change of linen in the suite. However we regret that we have not been able to satisfy the guests in terms of cleanliness.

The overall rating and comments on staff is very positive and this is proven by the reviews posted by other reviewers on Trip advisor. However we thank the reviewer for bringing to our notice on poor English communication that the reviewer experienced. We apologies the reviewer for the inconvenience coursed in terms of poor communication. On behalf of the staff we take all the comments very positively. We take staff training very seriously and train all our staff regularly. Our staff takes pride in what they do and we ensure that we continue to maintain a high level of service standard.

The staff was so nice to us and really tried hard to ensure we had a good time. Many of our concerns with the hotel are outside of the staff's control. We understand that this is considered a boutique hotel and they were limited with their resources, however, we hope that in the future, the hotel can improve with several different things. 

PROS: 

(1) Beautiful location. The hotel is located on a peninsula overlooking a beautiful ocean. There are two beaches to walk on - which is perfect during sunset. 
(2) Excellent service. The hotel staff treated us like kings. They also wanted to ensure we were having a good time. They provided us with a romantic dinner by the pool, served us a complimentary breakfast in our suite, and gave us a complimentary 100 minute massage. We enjoyed all of these things. 

CONS: 
(1) Outdated. This hotel was built over 20 years ago. Apparently it is going to have some major renovations in a few months, so it might be best to wait to come to this hotel until after the renovations (or get a good deal to come). My wife noted that the furniture and decorations were rather depressing and bland. The furnishing and materials did not appear to have been updated over the years and the cushions and pillows were discolored from fading and were stained. The material of these items were also itchy and non-inviting. The chairs appeared cheaply covered by towels and seemed run-down. The bedspread and other linens would have been more appropriate for a lower-cost stay such as an AirBNB. Possibly due to the outdated containers but the toiletries, such as shampoo and conditioner did not appear updated. We also had concerns about the cleanliness of the place as twice the linens had dark hairs on them and one towel was dirty when opened up. The bedroom doors had cracks to the outside (see picture). Consequently, we had bugs and insects inside our rooms and the beds do not have mosquito nets. All of the other hotels we stayed at (Water Garden Sigiriya, Wild Coast Tented Lodge, Ceylon Tea Trails and Kings Pavilion) had mosquito nets over the bed. It is also important to note that of all the locations we stayed at, this location had the most mosquitos. 
(2) Poor Value. We paid a lot for this hotel - more than Water Garden Sigiriya and Kings Pavilion, but felt it was too expensive for what was offered / the luxury provided. We felt our money went a lot farther at Water Garden Sigiriya and Kings Pavilion. We completely understand however, that our payments help pay for its location and the staff. 
(3) Lack of activities. The resort offers numerous activities that they will help schedule and always appeared eager to help in whatever way possible. The lack of on-site activities was still a problem in our opinion because it is less appealing to schedule a driver and activity.
(4) Poor communication: We found that for the most part, the staff had a difficult time speaking English. This should be expected since we are in a non-English speaking country. But of all the hotels we stayed it, we found this place the most difficult to communicate with the staff. For example, we called for room service and the attendant and I could not communicate. So he had to send someone else to our room so we can point to what we wanted on the menu. On another occasion, we asked 3 different staff members on what we should tip our driver to water sports activities. All 3 staff (including a manager) refused to answer. We eventually were told what we should tip as we were entering the tuk tuk. This was an important question for us because we did not want to tip too much, but we also did not want to disrespect the driver by not tipping enough. When we asked the hotel for advice, we expected them to easily give us an answer. 
(5) Food. The food was very bland. Some of the dishes were great (the soups were great), but it did not even come close to the other hotels that we stayed at. Many of the entrees were overcooked. We did however, love their homemade ice cream. 

Final Note: We loved Sri Lanka and hope the management makes several changes with the new renovation coming. Next time we are back in Sri Lanka, we are definitely willing to give this hotel another chance. Also, this place is great if you just want a relaxing time with good views and a very kind staff.","Service was Excellent.

We booked one Deluxe Villa with pool and one Deluxe Villa.

After the first night we asked to exchange the Deluxe Villa with pool (#17) to a Deluxe Villa. Villa 17 was very dark (very poor lighting), the bathroom was smelly and the pool full of leaves when we arrived.

The manager visited our villa, didn’t agree with our comments and was not friendly, in particular when considering that this should be a 5-Star Hotel. We have been to many 5-Star hotels in Asia (e.g. Oberoi, Banyan Tree, Lela Palace. Shangri-la, Anantara), hence were really disappointed with the room. Anyway at the end the manager agreed to give us a Deluxe room and a voucher for the SPA to compensate for the difference in the rate.

The Deluxe rooms have much more natural light, the bathroom was nicer than in villa 17 and the view is excellent as in the pool villa.

The location of the hotel is fantastic, the pool excellent and the hotel staff (except manager) are very nice and friendly.

We had four very good dinners and enjoyed various juices and very good wine.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay!

P.S.
Our recommended improvements:
- renovate the rooms and in particular bathroom;
-  replace swinging doors to bathroom 
- improve lightening in dressing/bathroom;
- put a coffee machine and water boiler for tea;
- management should be more visible and improve customer focus

Saman Villas offers a different approach to luxury, certainly not similar to what can be seen in most large five star hotels. The concept and design are derived from ancient Sri Lankan temple architecture with rustic elegance elements, combined with modern conveniences.
Saman Villas depicts a typical deluxe boutique resort and spa that is very Sri Lankan.
 
The website clearly explains the type of luxury the hotel offers as follows “A modern-day interpretation of Sri Lankan culture and style, 26 suites and the duplex villa offer casual luxury”, and may be our approach to subtle luxury did not appeal to the reviewer.

This reply is specifically intended to address the issues raised by the reviewer regarding the sea and the   seawater Contaminated from the nearby river and canal.

 Deduwa Lake including surrounding wetland covers an area of 1,800 hectares. For flood control a canal has been constructed through the Saman Villas rock to the sea. Deduwa water is coloured due to organic matter (mainly leaves collected over hundreds of years) but is not known to be polluted. However, during the short passage along this canal there is a rare possibility that water may be contaminated. Therefore guests are advised to use the south sea which is very far from the discharge point. You may see the vastness of Deduwa Lake and the canal in aerial photos in our Library or Google maps.

 There is another reason we encourage guests to avoid the north sea and instead use the south sea. There are many rocks on the north side and the area is generally considered unsafe for bathing. About a year ago two village girls bathing in the north sea were carried away by currents. Saman Villas Life Saving Team was able to save one of them. In November a guest from adjoining Hotel was saved by our Life Saving Team.

 Irrespective of the above issues many people, most of them from the village and adjoining hotels bath in this area. However we have been over cautious about the safety of our valued guests .

Thank you

We are very surprised with the review and rating, especially when over 98% of guests have praised the hotel and rated very good and excellent.

Saman Villas does not offer the standard luxuriousness similar to what can be seen in large five star hotels. The concept and design are derived from ancient Sri Lankan temple architecture with rustic elegance elements, combined with modern conveniences. Saman Villas depicts a typical deluxe boutique resort and spa with a Sri Lankan flavor . The website clearly explains the type of luxury the hotel offers “A modern-day interpretation of Sri Lankan culture and style.

Our guests have always appreciated the wide variety of menu options available at the hotel. Our Chefs are always delighted to tailor make any food item that is required by a guest . We have over 70 dishes in our menu  18 soups ,12 starters ,25 Main course  , 15 Deserts  which covers preferences of majority of guests and  also every day  four referent variety of set menu . 
 Had the reviewer informed us that they were not happy with the choices and required a tailor made dish, our Chefs would have gladly prepared any dish to the reviewer’s preference.

We regret to note the reviewers comments about our staff been board and unenthusiastic. The overall rating and comments on staff and service is rated very highly. This is evident by the reviews posted by other reviewers on Trip Advisor.

Trip advisor encourages owners to respond to negative comments. We welcome guest comments, we apologize when we have failed, we implement all good suggestions made by guests and we explain when we disagree. Our replies are based on verifiable facts and as we state in several replies, our responses are for the benefit of future visitors to the site.

Our rates vary throughout the year. In fact there are 4 different rate periods depending on many factors such as holiday season, weather, festivities, demand, etc. 
The cheapest is from April to October and most expensive from 24th December to 9th January . reviewer stayed  during  peak period .
Which is highest demand in the year and also our rate structure is flexible to the extent that a traveler can have a very cheap holiday with special offers during April to October period .

I wanted SO badly to like it (given that I was spending 4 nights there and was paying $750+ a night).
 
I’ll start with the pro’s- the rooms are very spacious and the resort is situated along nice beaches that have few people. We had a private pool overlooking the beautiful ocean. It is undoubtedly a relaxing place to be.. a beautiful location! 
 
Now for the cons. There is a certain shoddiness to the place that should not be present in a 5 star resort. Furniture in our room was worn around the edges, tiles in the bathroom were stained, the silver faucet in the bathroom was tarnished and green, there was mold around our door entrance and one the private pool tiles came off. Even the doors in our room didn’t quite close correctly (seems the wood had warped on the edges so that gaps emerged).
 
The food was decent- but menu is very limited so if you stay more than 2 days, it can get a bit boring. We also had a mandatory NYE dinner, and the food for that was just awful. We didn’t even eat some courses because they were so bad, and it was horribly overpriced.
 
Staff members are sweet but generally unenthusiastic and you get the sense they are just “moving through the motions”.  I found one front desk receptionists to be quite depressed in demeanor. Also, don’t expect any local recommendations from staff aside from pre-prepared tour packages. They couldn’t offer any recommendations within Bentota except for the only other 5 star resort. (By the way, there are plenty of local places to check out).
 
The spa is average.. staff there are very friendly but technique is not particularly outstanding. It is in a nice outdoor environment though.
 
Reading through other reviews, I’ve seen that management’s standard response to poor reviews was that this hotel should not be compared to a 5 star resort as it is an “authentic Sri Lankan experience”.  I completely disagree with this, because if I’m paying inflated prices that equal other 5 star resorts globally (regardless of whether Saman Villas’ rates are cheaper during low season), I still expect 5 star quality.
 
Sadly out of all hotels in Sri Lanka, this was the biggest disappointment.","Not a 5 star hotel ","2018-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r555188680-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The rooms were beautiful with out own pool, the restaurant was very nice and although you could not call it fine dining, there was a good choice with an interesting asian flavour as one might expect. There were very few people staying there (off peak) and we usually had the main pool more or less to ourselves. 
There were two downsides, firstly the journey to and from Columbo, (we had underestimated the terrible roads) and secondly the outcome of us losing a room key. This led to a $200 fee which we considered exorbitant even if they did have to replace a lock. There was no warning in advance and this hotel was certainly not cheap in the first place. Even the idea that they would charge in dollars rather than local currency suggested a penalty rather than a replacement cost. We asked to speak to the manager who was spoken to by staff on the phone but who refused to speak to us. The staff told us they would lose their jobs if we wouldn't pay. I don't know whether this was true or not but they had been very nice to us so we paid so as not to find out!.

Our reply is intended to our prospective guests lest they get the wrong impression that our room rates, food and beverage prices are excessive and not competitive. 
All of us like to buy everything cheap but only a very few guests have commented that our prices are too high. A brief explanation of our pricing policy may help to clarify these concerns.
 
ROOM RATES ARE TOO HIGH
1. Prices are determined according to demand. From last week of December to second week of March the demand is very high due to holiday season (X mas, New Year and Chinese New Year) and more importantly European and Russian Winter. Naturally during such periods prices are high. The same room that the reviewer paid USD 603 ++ is available at USD 411 ++ for the same number of nights, any time from 01st April to 31st October. We offer prices and special offers to suit many budgets. Why come at the most expensive period and complain, when in fact you can have the same room very much cheaper for a continuous period of 7 months. 

2. Price differences for rooms with pools and without pools for the period of the review are given below. 

BED & BREAKFAST RATES
Deluxe Suite without Pool                                        USD  529++
Deluxe Suite with Pool          				         USD  603++
Grand Deluxe Suite with Pool (much more privacy) USD  673++
Saman Villa Suite with Pool(absolute privacy)         USD  733++

Deluxe Suite with Pool has two major advantages; a 22 foot lap pool and a secluded garden for private use. The difference between Deluxe Suite without Pool and with pool is only USD 74++. We offer rooms with greater privacy at a higher supplement for those who are excessively concerned about privacy.  

FOOD PRICES ARE HIGH
Please compare quality, variety, range, choices  and prices of our food with any boutique hotel of similar size anywhere in the world and you will find our food is reasonably priced. We offer a total of 84 dishes comprising soups, starters, menus, snacks and desserts and a daily 4 course set menu with 9 choices which vary daily in a two week cycle. To provide this huge menu whilst conforming to HACCP food safety standards, we carry a large range of raw materials and mise en place. In addition, we employ an experienced and qualified foreign executive chef (currently on leave) and a large team of highly experienced cooks. Naturally our costs are high. All this effort is primarily to delight our customers with the best and at reasonable prices. Almost all our guests love our food. 

BEVERAGE PRICES ARE HIGH
In Sri Lanka foreign liquor is considered non-essential and the ultimate luxury. In addition, foreign liquor is an important revenue generator for the government. Hence duty is extremely high compared to the Western World and most other countries. However, our prices are not higher than any boutique hotel of similar standard anywhere in the world.

However the reason for only giving 3 stars is value for money. At £500 per night B and B I had expected villa with private pool to be just that - private. I did not expect the villas to be 2 storey with others sitting on their verandas overlooking our pool area (see photo taken in the pool on the farthest side from the villa). Whilst I realise the couple upstairs had better things to do than sit and look at us all day, the fact that they were there, and so close was very disconcerting. Unfortunately said upstairs guests were both unwell with hacking coughs which disturbed us constantly. We tried to change rooms but were told that all the rooms with pools were occupied. We appreciate that it is not the hotel's fault that our upstairs neighbours were ill but maybe an emollient word from one of the managers (we were told the manager would be informed of our discontent) would have made for good customer relations. Even a complimentary bottle of wine might have made us feel that they cared that we were unhappy. We were offered a change of room on our penultimate night but the upstairs people were leaving that day anyway. 
Restaurant food was good but quite prices. Ditto drinks. 
In short, lovely place mostly but very overpriced for what you get.

Many of our guests praise the air-conditioning we have in the suites and we were rather surprised with the reviewers comments. We provide Daikin invertor type air-conditioning units. The two whisper quite indoor units are placed in each suite to have an improve air distribution. The units do not make any howling sound unlike other air conditioners. Both air-conditioning units can be operated at a very low speed with a comfortable temperature rather than managing with one unit at a higher speed and lower temperature. We personally inspected the suite occupied by the reviewer and  found  no issues with the air conditioner.

We have over 50 dishes in our menu which covers preferences of majority of guests. Had the reviewer informed us that they were not happy with the choices and required a tailor made dish, our Chefs would have gladly prepared any dish to the reviewer’s preference.

The railway track is over 800 meters away from the hotel. The noise of the trains has not been an issue for the vast majority of guests. 

Our guests have always appreciated the wide variety of menu options available at the hotel. Our Chefs are always delighted to tailor make any food item that is required by a guest . We have over 50 dishes in our menu which covers preferences of majority of guests. Had the reviewer informed us that they were not happy with the choices and required a tailor made dish, our Chefs would have gladly prepared any dish to the reviewer’s preference.

We do not serve or believe in offering buffet style meals to our guests. We instead freshly prepare all our food items individually for each guest. Even the small items such as the breakfast preserves are prepared daily as we believe in providing the very best to our guests.

Our room was no. 29, which is the closest to the train track.

Also I found they could have made much more effort with the beach area. The beds were few and far between and they were never neat. To get to the beach you pass a small area of land that they could do so much with. Instead it was bland  and boring and not at all inspiring.  On the positive side, their  suites were FANTASTIC. We had 2 bedrooms and loved the layout. The suite was clean and the views amazing. I could not fault the room at all. This was 5 stars. 
Where this hotel needs to make changes is with their price advertising when you are there. They were the ONLY hotel and bar that we visited in Sir Lanka, that did not include government tax when laying out their prices on their menus. So you assumed you were paying the price stated. In fact they then added 34% on top! This included 24% for tax and then 10% for service. Please in future, let your guests know this by stating this clearly on the menus and not in small print either. Let guests know that the prices are plus 34%. The wine is expensive here especially when they add on that 34%, so beware. 
Also in the rooms there was no plates, knives and forks etc. We were told this is extra! Seems a silly policy when you provide a kitchen. We did not cook, so did not bother us particularly. Also be aware that the items provided in the room such as snacks and drinks also have 34% added on to the advertised pricing. 
So long as you are aware of the lack of transparency with pricing, I would highly recommend their suites.  They themselves, were well worth the price paid.","5 star suites but poor transparency with their pricing once you are at the resort.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g13074134-d24007036-r996872341-Crystal_Sands-Rathgama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The staff at reception were extremely helpful and professional and our check-in was efficient and quick.  Our room had a wonderful view over the swimming pool and to the lake beyond.  Our room was spacious, the bed comfortable and there was a good shower.  The swimming pool was also very large and lovely, although there were limited sunbeds.

To the negatives.  We ate at the Breeze Bar, Nuga Gama and the Lantern Restaurants.  At both Breeze Bar and Lantern we had to wait an excessively long time for our food.  At the Breeze Bar my club sandwich finally arrived cold and had to be sent back.  I found the Nuga Gama restaurant disappointing - many of the buffet dishes had sub-standard cuts of grisly meal or were full of bones.  Our most disappointing experience however was in the Lantern Restaurant, where our fish was totally over-cooked and served with incorrect sauces.  These restaurants were definitely not up to the 5* experience I was expecting.","Nice hotel, shame about their restaurants","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r992721873-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

3 course menu for lunch and dinner in our meal rate with generous portions and a creative menu prepared daily by our chef to ensure the freshest ingredients. The ambience that we create at Maya is part of the dining experience with the beautiful set up which you enjoyed on your first night and took many pictures of. Naturally our guests are free to enjoy the local restaurants in Tangalle, however we do prepare both western and Sri Lankan food at Maya food offering 10 different curries and condiments in the rate for our Sri Lankan dinners. The dishes are re-filled as many times as much as our guests can eat. We have not put up our rates for meals for more than 3 years so we do feel that it is a fair price based on the level of food, service and special atmosphere that we create which was kindly noted by you. 

With regards to the tea. We do offer a complimentary tea everyday at 4.30pm with tea, coffee, juice, fresh fruit, cake and biscuits. I am sorry that you were not able to enjoy the  tea since you were sightseeing during the afternoons. I will address this issue to ensure our guests can still enjoy the complimentary tea even if they are not there at the time, as it was disappointing to hear that you missed it. 

I was very pleased to hear that you enjoyed all the other facilities that we offer at Maya and appreciated the surroundings. I was especially pleased to hear that you thought the staff were service orientated and the place was stunning.

The Positives
The staff were excellent . So polite and helpful. They really made you feel welcome and looked after us so well. Special thanks to Priyantha, Thakshila, Sanjeewa and Chameditha. 
The food was great. Presented beautifully and each item described fully by the waiter. We loved the buffet breakfasts especially the avocado on toast. Thanks to the kitchen staff for their excellent cooking. 
The view from the garden was exceptional. 

The Negatives
We had booked a superior double and did not expect to be in the basement with no view and a shared patio area which was about 10feet below ground level. 
The mattress on one side of the bed was a disgrace and resulted in a sleepless night. They did change this mattress after I complained. 
The hanging rail in the wardrobe was at least 7 foot 6 inches! Even my husband who is over 6 foot struggled to reach. I had no chance at 5 foot! No light in wardrobe so unable to see in! 
Bathroom and wardrobe doors banged into each other when opened making it impossible to enter either spaces . 

Such a shame as this could have been our best stay in Sri Lanka.","What a Disappointment","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r996345000-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

The hotel is charming and the rooms quirky. However, there were a few hiccups that dropped the star rating. We called about a week in advanced to confirm there were driver's quarters available during our stay.  Although they confirmed there would be, upon arrival they informed us there was no space for our driver.  With little to no solutions offered we paid for him to stay elsewhere. We also found the price to be quite high especially as compared to our other stays. The hotel also lacks a swimming pool which seems like a missed opportunity.

We booked 2 deluxe rooms which are at the bottom of the property. On check in there was an overpowering smell of lemongrass, and a whiff of sewage. Unfortunately we woke at 1am to find our room totally flooded with raw sewage. We tried to find hotel staff to assist but there was no one to be found until 6.30am. We also called the hotel contact number multiple times but it just rang out. As most of our luggage was on the floor we had a massive clean up exercise and needed to throw some things away for hygiene reasons. The manager was very helpful when he turned up and offered various things to compensate but it was a very unpleasant experience. We insisted on being moved to another room. The hotel cleaned up our room and put other people in it the next night. There had been unseasonal rain for many months apparently which had probably led to the issue.","Nice hotel, great view but some issues…","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r931857933-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

One hesitates to be too critical of a hotel in a country that is struggling and you have fallen in love with but when they are charging a very full “European” type price for Dinner, Bed & Breakfast you really do have to judge them by European standards.

The positives; the location is great, the views are stupendous, the staff are smiley & friendly and the food is good.

Not so good; the room needed work. Looked like a collection of bits rather than a thought through design. The tap was loose, the shower leaked and good luck using the loo if you had long legs.

And if you pop a hot tub in the room then it really needs to be clean. Ours was grubby, which in a hot tub is not acceptable.

We stayed in about half a dozen places during our trip this time and this was the poorest quality and value by a country mile.

It’s I a shame because I was so looking forward to staying there having stayed in ECKO Polonnaruwa which was superb.

We spent 10 days travelling around in Sri Lanka, and EKHO Ella was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. I booked the honeymoon suite and expected great things due to the positive reviews on Booking.com. 

Sadly the room was tired (furniture and soft furnishings were old and worn out), dirty (the walls need a lick of paint, and the soft furnishings were stained and need replacing). The room was dark, and the only natural light came from the jacuzzi area which is a shame. We could only enjoy the view from the garden, but not from our room. There is no pool which is crazy for the price the charge (£220 per night).

The jacuzzi in our room felt dirty and uninviting. The biggest problem was that whenever there was a power cut in the area, the jacuzzi automatically reset itself and turned on. During our stay there were 4 power cuts at night, which meant that between 2am - 4am the jacuzzi turned on and started spraying water literally everywhere around the room. Needless to say that we didn't get much sleep at night as power cuts are quite common in Sri Lanka. The room next to ours also had a jacuzzi. As jacuzzis are loud creatures, the neighbouring rooms can definitely hear them. 

There was a speaker in the hallway just outside of our room, so we could hear the music from our bed (eg. acoustic version on Linking Park was playing close to 10pm...), which is not necessarily what we wanted during your romantic stay. 

Dinner in the restaurant was good, but breakfast was rather sad. It is such a shame, because the staff are literally the nicest people we have ever met in our entire lives, and couldn't have been more helpful and more professional. 

We were supposed to stay in the hotel for 2 nights, but checked out after our first night. We relocated to 5* hotel in Ella which was honestly breathtaking (we had our own little chalet with a view over the tea plantation, 5* food and 5* service, plus pool and spa) for £150 per night.

So my advice is not to be fooled by the clever photos and rave reviews on booking.com. The hotel has potential, but you're better off staying somewhere else in Ella for less money and a better overall experience.","Sadly this hotel doesn't deliver on its promise...","2022-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d14968612-r829103559-EKHO_Ella-Ella_Uva_Province.html",

However, the hotel did not match expectations. The first room we were placed in - a ground floor ""Deluxe Room"" - was dirty (the bedsheets had stains on them, the pillow case was ripped, there was dust all over the furniture and dust cobwebs underneath everything), there was an additional travel bed included by mistake even though we had booked a double bed, and the bathroom had a horrible sewage smell, we think it came through the vent. We immediately complained and the staff were very apologetic and helpful - they arranged for us to stay in a different room the next day, and cleaned the existing room before we slept in it that night. The next room we stayed in was much nicer - it was clean, much larger, had no bad smells, and had a great view. We are grateful that the staff were so helpful and accommodating, although it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. 

We ate breakfast a Ekho every day - the selection was varied and delicious - and ate dinner here once. The dinner was not great, and we did not return for another lunch or dinner. However the restaurant staff were very polite and helpful and, similar to the reception staff, would go out of their way to help and provide a good service.

This is the only hotel where we experienced this in Sri Lanka, so be aware. We were leaving early in the morning before breakfast so requested a packed breakfast (we had bed & breakfast booked) and our guide ordered and paid for a breakfast for himself. Our guides breakfast didn’t turn up and we were delayed leaving by 30 minutes and on a tight schedule. The staff eventually gave us 3 bags so we left and thought we had 3 breakfasts. However, they had divided our two into three so no one had a full and proper breakfast! This was deceitful and done in the attempt to hide their mistake.

We thank  you for your  feedback,   If any bills were not submitted daily for signature, we accept it was a grave mistake on our part and apologize on behalf of  our team.  We will ensure this will NEVER  happen again. 

As  owners we are contactable any time by telephone or email and we are in constant contact with the staff to ensure our guests have a lovely time at South Point Properties.

As you are aware we have been dealing with the lead client from UK, met her two days after arrival and spoke to her two days prior to departure.  Each time she confirmed the 12 family members were having a lovely time during the 10 nights stay celebrating her 70th birthday. 

Before arrival, we  emailed  "" Guide lines ""  requesting all bills to be signed on a daily basis  at a time convenient to the client and what to expect during the stay at our properties with contact details of owners,  to the lead client as we had only her email address.

A luxury  9 seat coach is kept available 24 hours on standby for hire. This enables the villa to transport  our clients at short notice or in an emergency. Rates are always advised before the hire. If the hire was confirmed, it is because the rate has been approved by a member of the group.

To the best of our knowledge no member of  the group  hired an elephant during this period at  our properties.

If a client is interested in hiring an elephant for the whole day, prices are checked with the elephant owners association and quoted.  As far as we know - there is No elephant owners in Galle and elephants need to be transported by truck to the properties. Maintaining/transporting  elephants are very expensive therefore we do not bargain with the elephant owners, as we think it is not fair to them.

We contacted the lead client and apologized if bills were not submitted daily and asked her to forward our email to you.  

We  appreciate your feedback and will ensure bills are given for signature  on a daily basis and  apologies once again for any shortcomings by our manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Matara Road Kathaluwa, Ahangama 80650 Sri Lanka","Ahangama","Sri Lanka","80650",,"Matara Road","Kathaluwa","643117","5.980658","Ahangama, Galle District, Southern Province","80.340675","South Point Villa","251","4.9","1","1","1","11","237","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g674590-d643117-Reviews-South_Point_Villa-Ahangama_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.southpointvilla.com/","2013-03-13","OTHER","3",,"Value","2","Rooms","3","Location","3","Cleanliness","4","Service","4","Sleep Quality","4","Lovely place to stay, however there were a lot of outgoings that we were not prepared for or made aware of.

Thank u for ur review ! first of all i like to clarify u difference of the package rate and the pay as u go at site ! 
when u book the package all the extra fees and taxes include in the rate ,
when u book off the pacakage u may have to pay percentage of taxes ,and percentage of other relevant fees to be added up ,i think u only count as just the face value but there is other fees such as above to be add on ! so u will end up paying more than the package rate !  i have clearly explained u at site about this but may be u havnt clearly understood ! 

second thing is ,u should have compared other surf camps in the area and check out their rates and quality ! because we know that we have the chepeset option with our all the facilities and the quality of the surf lessons and the yoga and our place  ! when other surf camps taking 10 people at a time for surf lesson with one surf instructor , we only take 4 people with one instructor to gives a true better experience for our students ! 

its pity that u havent mention this in person when im arond but i have warned them and made sure it not gonna happen again ,they gonna finshed their construction in the off season so there will be no any of these problems will occur ! 

even tho u complained about few things , im happy that u came back for the second time on same month after u had ur tour inside the sri lanka ! unfortunately u had an accident in ur leg while u travelling up country but i hope our staff has been taken care of u very well on ur second visit to our surf camp on the same month ! 

i wish u getting well soon ,and of course u re welcome to see us back on our next season with upgraded service !

I went during the end of the season, so it was very quiet, and it kind of seemed like they'd just given up a bit. It was generally run down and dirty and there was rarely staff around when you needed them. I did the surf and yoga package as it's advertised as a ""deal"" and found out that had I not booked the package and just paid for classes when I took them I would have saved so much money. I paid £100 for the week more than people doing the exact same thing as me, and when I brought this up with the owner he didn't do anything about it and said that bookyogaretreats.com (where I booked it through) take some money. But it didn't add up to THAT MUCH money. 
Another issue would be the construction workers next door, I was followed by them, shouted at by them and just stared at and intimidated by them - there should be some kind of warning of this? 
Food wasn't great but was very expensive in comparison to food elsewhere. 
A few positives though! The yoga and surfing classes were really, really fab and made up for lots of the disappointment elsewhere! The yoga and surf instructors were probs the best part about the place, such nice and helpful people! The beds were super comfy and big, and I was lucky to be given a free upgrade as they only had a few other guests. And it is an excellent place to meet other solo travellers, almost everyone there when I was there was travelling solo like me, and I ended up travelling with a few of them afterwards. However, it's definitely not worth the money. Maybe going during peak time is completely different, but my experience wasn't as good as it could have been and my money would have been way better spent elsewhere.

The bad
- I booked a private air condition room with a bathroom. Since day one, the toilet was not flush properly.  The staff did not show any urgency to fix this issue so I have to mess with the water tank to make it usable.   On day 4, the hotel  finally get a plumber to come fix the problem
- The sink in my toilet was leaking,  Never fix 
- I don't know why the surf package was not offered  to me as I discuss with the owner directly.   It seem like the other guest was given that option except me so perhaps they do not welcome folks over 30.   The owner lead me to book surf lesson individually which cost more than a package.

Thank u for the review ,
there re 7 normal rooms with fans and 4 a/c rooms ,thik u have booked a normal room ! so there will be no a/c,im sorry that u havnt got enough pressure in water ,but we have fixed that problem already ! 

we have managed to do the breakfast even more faster now,thank u for the tip on it !
although we couldnt leave fruits cutting ready to serve because it will be not fresh as it is when u cut them,thats why we cut them at the time we get the order ! 
 
we have more than 20 boards at the camps, and we have added new boards to the collection with variety of sizes,
and i would like to correct u at the point of there is no where we have mention unlimited access to the boards , all in our web site it says ,free board rental during the surf lessons ,i  think u misread something !all of our boards are new and not old more than 1 year ,
some of them could be damaged but we repaired it ,i dont think u will find any surf boards in a surf camp with all new boards use every time ! if someone break a surf board during a surf lesson ,we do not charge at all, so there is nothing to be afraid,

Accommodation:
The rooms are spacious, if a little bare. Shower is ok, low pressure, not always hot or even warm water, but that’s ok in this part of the world. My room did not have AC, just a fan - I'm not sure whether there are rooms with AC but if so, better to take one of those. While I was there, they only cleaned the room every 5 days which is not enough, plus I had only a linen sheet as a blanket, but no actual linen on the mattress itself. This kind of makes you question the hygiene. To be fair though, I never complained about this and just used my travel sleeping bag. 
The camp has a pool which is cleaned daily. There’s a few loungers/sunbeds. There’s a construction site next door at the moment, they’re usually working from early in the morning, but this can happen everywhere. 
Wifi hardly ever works properly and often not at all, also not unusual in this neck of the woods, but if you’re reliant on a working internet connection, you may want to buy a local SIM card or have some data package from home (granted, 3/4G often also doesn’t work)

Food & restaurant
The restaurant is on the third floor and has several couches, hammocks and a few swinging chairs - plus a nice view of the ocean. It makes for a great place to hang, chill, eat, have a beer, whatever you prefer.
The food is fine as is the selection. While the service is friendly, the speed and organization at meal times are sometimes a challenge. Especially during breakfast time, people often had to wait 1 hour+ for their food, which led to a few grumpy reactions by some - understandably. It’s not really anyone’s fault, probably, but maybe with some preparation, this could be organized in a much easier way (e.g. there are several breakfast options, maybe just make it a buffet or at least prepare some of it, e.g. the fruit platters and toast, upfront). Every now and then the orders were not delivered at all. Around dinner time, this seems to have been less of a problem and staff were usually also able to accommodate special dietary needs or wishes if you explained them carefully.
There are also yoga lessons on the rooftop, with a very flexible schedule, often at sunset - very nice.

Community feel:
You will meet people from all over the world here, there are almost daily special events at the rooftop bar/restaurant (e.g. BBQ, movie nights, etc.). I’ve seen quieter camps before, this one is definitely a bit more on the partying side, which isn’t bad, but you should be aware of it. If you're looking for a quiet romantic getaway, this hotel isn't for you.

Surfing lessons:
There is a beach break right in front of the hotel. The beach is a little dirty and there are definitely nicer beaches in the area (Mirissa, Dikwalla). The reef break is a few minutes down the beach. The group lessons are held with a 3:1 or 4:1 student-instructor ratio (which is a good group size) and the guys (Fisher, Rafa, Sam) are enthusiastic, optimistic and helpful. They could spend more time on explaining the break(s), surf theory, etiquette, how to manage the board in the water etc. I’m not a beginner, but others were so some of that basic knowledge needs to be taught, even if that surfing experience is a one-off event for many. The line-up at at least the beach break is empty even during high season, so there’s a bit less danger, however that doesn’t mean anyone with a surfboard shouldn’t know a few basics (think drop-ins and flying boards…)
The by far biggest downside is the lack of boards and the quality of some of the boards. There are nowhere near enough boards to accommodate all surfing guests (plus some others, e.g. walk-ins or those of the partner hostel). Part of the package is “unlimited use of board” during the day, even outside of the lessons - yet there was often no equipment around to be used as lessons were still ongoing. Often even the lessons had to be spread out more than necessary as there weren’t enough boards to do them at the same time. To make it worse, some boards are clearly broken or dinged to a point of being risky to take it out to the water. The selection is also very limited - there are a few foamies, a few huge hardboards (8’2” and larger), and at best a handful of minimals/funboards. If you have your own board, then by all means: bring it. This particular aspect is really not acceptable - this is a surfcamp, not just a hostel that happens to have a few boards lying around. A surf camp needs to have enough boards to accommodate everyone if at full capacity at any time during the day, and it needs a selection that caters to a wide range of surfers with various levels of surfing skills. I’ve been to several camps before all over the world and while the quality of the boards is often mediocre, there was never a shortage.

Overall, this is not the worst choice, but I'm not sure if it's the best either. The cost for the camp is at Western European level, which is normal for surfcamps anywhere in the world - but for this one, you're not fully getting your money's worth. A little bit of effort, TLC and a few small changes could potentially make this a really great place, though.","Mixed feelings","2017-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d8847015-r453858139-The_Surfer_Surf_Camp_Sri_Lanka-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

This is a small but well maintained property - the tall walls give a sense of solitude keeping outside noise at bay. There is 24hr security. It has a very earthy and homely feel which we liked. It also has a beautiful lotus pond. The pool is small but well kept. If you didn't want to go to the beach on a day, you can lounge by the pond or in the pool. 

Cons: 
Overall, just not worth the money. We spent USD $550 for two nights (just stay for a double room), granted we went during peak travel time, but still extremely pricey for what you get considering the size of the property and what they can offer you. We ordered dinner on both days and they gave us the exact same curries! Also, the portions were surprisingly small for the price we paid. Would have preferred some variety. Even the breakfast was so-so. Well prepared and presented, but just limited. In addition, the Unawatuna beach (which we realize now) is eroded and nothing great. Would suggest going a little bit north at a resort in the Bentota area if you are looking for a kid-friendly vacation.","Not value for money","2015-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r337117358-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your constructive criticisms. I arrived back from my work project in Dubai the afternoon after your departure to hear about your dissatisfaction.
 
 We aim to provide good service and keep our boutique villa spotlessly clean. Cockroaches fly in through open doors and windows, especially after a rain. all our rooms are meant to be open and breezy. That is the only explanation I can give for the appearance of the cockroaches. Our assistant manager informed me you saw two, now I see there were seven!! Amazing! Sorry about that!

Yes, since we first named the pavilions, trees in surrounding gardens have continued to grow, closing much the few open views we had. At our next website review we will change the name to something more like  SeaGlimps Pavilion.

At the time of your visit we were fuly occupied. with lots of demaind on the showers. We were also experiencing a drought, so the garden was receiving lots of water as well. Unfortunately the local authority decided on a few days to cut the water supply to the entire village. We thought our water storage tank and water tower were large enough to cover such a situation. Obviously not!  We have subsequently built a huge extra water storage tank to assure this situation never happens again.

The Happy Beach Restaurant is a worry for me. Thank goodness they do not have their parties with any sort of regularly.  It seems that night was the owner's birthday and the whole village was in attendance. Many local Sri Lankans seem to have a different attitude toward noise and loud music than we westerners, with parties that can easily break eardrums! I am very sorry that this one happened during your stay.

The grounds outside are all immaculate and very peaceful. We were due to stay 4 nights however due to a few problems we checked out a night early which sadly put a dampener on our experience there. 

Firstly I really think the 'sea view pavillion' should not be advertised as a sea view. The room is beautiful and it has a large balcony with beautiful views, but we walked the whole way along it and could only see a tiny bit of sea through a load of palm trees if you squinted. There is definitely a view but do not expect a sea view.

Sadly on our third night there we discovered a cockroach issue in our room. The room was spotless in every other way so we were surprised by this, but we discovered 7 large cockroaches climbing up the mosquito net on our bed (inside and out) in the space of a couple of hours. We have travelled a lot in Asia and tropical countries and understand cockroaches come with the territory to a certain extend but for the price we were paying we weren't very happy about these visitors.

The water supply to our bathroom was very sporadic and would often go off for hours at a time so we were unable to shower, wash our hands or flush the toliet. Again for the price we were paying we didnt't feel that this was acceptable. 

There seemed to be a lot of staff around but only one of them spoke an adequate amount of English which was a little frustrating a times. (Apparently the owner was away, who I think is discussed quite a lot in the other reviews). We were under the impression that we would be able to have dinner here but when we went to investigate on our first night we were just told no. Sadly I was feeling very unwell so my partner had to leave me by myself in order to go and find somewhere for him to eat and they didn't seem to be able to help us out which was a shame.

The final point I have to make I have to stress I am aware that this wasn't the fault of Sergeant House but still feel I need to make people aware. On our third night (a wednesday night) the bar across the road 'Happy Beach' had a big party. The music was incredibly loud, so much so that the bass was making our room shake and no amount of ear plugs or head phones managed to even slightly drown the music out. This went on until gone 2am and we were wide awake until this point. As this was supposed to be the relaxing part of our trip and considering Sergeant House was by far the most expensive place we stayed we were very annoyed, especially as it had been advertised and being 'quiet and tranquil' away from the noisy bars of unawantuna beach. 

Sadly all these things and the total lack of sleep on our third night meant that we decided to leave a night early. After complaining about the water issue and the cockroaches they did give us a 10% discount on our stay which was good of them.

This property really is beautiful and the member of staff who did speak english was very helpful and we are grateful to him but there does seems to be a few teething problems which need sorting out.  

The noise on the last night we realise was not their fault but sadly it did kind of ruin it for us but maybe we were just unlucky.","Beautiful but a few issues","2014-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3731146-r200196832-Sergeant_House-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

- The location is exquisite but it is very remote, even a walk down the beach is quite difficult. 
- Food was delicious however slightly limited with choice given no other restaurants nearby 
- Pool area is amazing 
- The manager and the staff were all lovely people. Our butler Namal was an absolute legend. 
- There is a bit of a bug issue unfortunately. There are ants everywhere - all over the decking, sunbeds, and tents. It made sitting outside very uncomfortable generally. Whilst it is impossible to control nature, I didn't get the impression anything was treated with anti insect measures 
- Big mosquito issue in the evening despite wearing repellant. Again, would have liked to see some efforts to counter the issue generally 
- The spa is a bit lacking. It is 2 tents without any centralised area. My partner and I both had treatments that had respective issues (not the quality of the massage). Management was very receptive and removed them from the bill and is working on remedying the issue
- We went with an 8 month old baby, and despite the staff doing their best to accommodate, the location just isn't set up properly for a baby","Paradise with an itch ","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27134365-d13999900-r952023230-Karpaha_Sands-Kiran_Eastern_Province.html",

However, we ended up speaking to some of the managers who upgraded our rooms to suites free of cost... These were much nicer, but still only average. The decor was quite dated and the suites were bigger but still quite basic (e.g. no coffee machine in a suite?).

A few things to mention: Prayers at a local mosque started early in the morning and ended up waking us up around 6am. Some of the rooms had loud music playing from the night to the early morning (think cheesy club music till 4am). The restaurant was nice, but the food was average. There was a strange food court set-up on one end of the hotel but needed an extra payment to use it (we couldn't be bothered and ended up just eating out).","Needs a refurbishment and a fresh look, feels like you've gone back to the 60s!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d12864938-r1016719001-Araliya_Green_City-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The breakfast and dinner buffet at the restaurant was below average, and the service pretty slow.

On the brighter side, the live music during dinner was very good, and they even allowed the guests to sing and dance.

Nice breakfast, though aimed more at local taste than at foreigners. Nice inside heated pool, only one of the five in the whole island; though with amateuristic setup, e.g. showers are in the nextdoor spa not in the pool space. And nice that for 2nd part of the family they gave a free upgrade to studio.

Needs improving: lousy organisation and staff training. 15 minutes to wait in the lobby before the welcome drinks arrive is absurd. Dinner also a bit chaotic, with some of the buffet heating (e.g. soup) being below needed temperature. Bathroom, however new, already has leaking bath tub sink and generally too cold/lukewarm water.

However, as our stay unfolded we were met with a deluge of bugs in our room.  Aware the weather was awful, we were staying essentially in a jungle, and bugs are to be expected - but this was an infestation.  Whilst the staff worked to clean them away, they kept appearing even after they removed a nest in the curtains!  Whilst it was treated  efficiently, it didn't feel like it was being solved and wouldn't be after we left.
We had, a few days prior, stayed on a remote island in a glamping tent surrounded by the wild and didnt experience anything like the issues here - so the jungle is only so much of a reason!  Rest of the hotel did seem unaffected however.

Due to this, we decided to leave a day early and move onto our next location.  So in total we had 2 nights here.

Whilst there staff were friendly, service was good.  We were suprised that the dinner menu is essentially one main course option, and if you don't like it then they can rustle up some pasta - that's it.  Seemed odd for a five star hotel.

They don't do lunch options btw!

Our suite is advertised as having a rainfall shower and a TV - it had neither.

Michel is a good host / hotel owner and despite trying to sort things out, its unfortunate we didn't feel comfortable in the hotel, struggled to sleep and decided to leave early to continue our luxury honeymoon.","Unfortunate experience","2019-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d1822843-r736993968-Lake_Lodge_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for your recent review and for taking the time to give your feedback.

Your comments are appreciated but I would like to respond to some of the points that you raised.

Firstly, your comments regarding the style and construction of the hotel. The style is very much in keeping with Sri Lanka and the location of the hotel. You would also have had the opportunity prior to booking with us to view the photos of the hotel on our website, I am therefore somewhat surprised that you did not know what to expect.

With regard to the WiFi and TV service, I am sorry it did not meet your requirements but I would point out that (a) service generally is not always good in Sri Lanka and (b) being located in the jungle as we are, we cannot always guarantee a good service.

Moving on to your comments regarding the laundry and cleanliness of the room, I apologise that it did not meet your standards but I would once again reiterate that (a) being located in a jungle location it is very difficult to prevent insects etc from entering the rooms and (b) we change the bed linen etc on a regular basis, or when the guests request it, but we are aiming to care for the local environment and to be an Eco-friendly hotel.
If the board is left on the bed we do not change the bed linen, during your stay the board was left on your bed, therefore the sheets were not changed.

I would like to stress that if you had raised any of these concerns at the time of your stay my team and I would have, of course, taken any measures possible to rectify them. You did not raise any concerns and in fact left very positive comments about your stay in our Guest book.

On a final note I would like to say that art in any form means different things to different people, what some see as beautiful others may see as ugly, I am sorry you saw my hotel as undesirable but that is a very personal opinion, I also think that hotels in jungle/remote locations may not be your ideal location.

Once again, thank you for your comments and I respect your choice not to return to my hotel.

Start positive.  Excellent staff, friendly, helpful, attentive.  Excellent kitchen -- certainly above average and I am a picky foodie.  Good location.  Nice views from the balcony of thick forest tree tops and the foothills in the distance.  BUT after 16 days in Sri Lanka I cannot say that the Lake Lodge is competitive on value offered for money demanded compared to many other places we stayed.  Three nights, with meals taken breakfast and dinner there was close to $1000 for a couple.  Why is that not good value?  Now the negatives -- the hotel is poured concrete everywhere.  So the room reminded me of my freshman dormatory with its concrete work space and even poured concrete end tables next to the bed.  This stark and souless construction could have been softed with lots of local products, fabrics, masks, art work, to make it warmer and cozier rather than cold and sterile.  The wifi/internet was the WORST of the trip.  During the day it is agonizingly slow to read a newspaper or do email and at night it gets essentially non-functional.  Forget about streaming video content.  The TV had few stations (no CNN or BBC) and those channels it had were very poor, snowy images out of the 1950s.  The room was also not properly cleaned and serviced - the Please Be Green card on the bed said linens changed every other day but that didn't happen (I could tell because the linens had small holes in my corner of the bed and they never disappeared).  The bathroom on arrival had, at eye level when sitting on the toilet, two large spider webs with large and very much alive spiders that I had to sweep down to avoid company in the loo.  And the upper shelf in the bathroom, where water glasses were left turn rim down, was thick, very thick, with dust.  It clearly had not been dusted in a long time, and yet our water glasses were sitting in the fluff.  All this is to say that, for three nights and $1000 you can do much better.  This is a hotel whose reach exceeds its grasp, which is a pity because the local staff are all wonderful people.  I would not go back, sad to say.","Not value for money","2015-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d1822843-r302402473-Lake_Lodge_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The bathroom was also of a good size and there was a decent terrace overlooking the treetops.
Monkeys woke us early on both mornings clambering about on the roof – a source of amusement rather than irritation.
The food was OK from a very limited menu, the service was also OK but both were a little slow and communication a bit of a strain. Guests wanting cold drinks seemed to be a novelty and they struggled to accommodate. It also later transpired that they are not licensed and although they did provide a couple of beers it was a tedious process.

How ever with the air quality being heavily down graded,  me and my wife of 45 years were never able to enjoy the place. Me for born and bred in the same vicinity (S LANKA) long time ago about 79 years saw a disappointing feeling when we have to breath dirty air one from motor traffic , emission coming from railways and then the nasty environmental pollution coming from faraway places  like New Delhi and so on carried by jet stream for which the hotel has no control . 

However my complaint is about the hotel management which  was trying to play a fast one on us , when they said they have no room for us when this was booked through  Agoda and had a confirmation number . They told me that they have no room for us and want to send us to another hotel of less standing of which I have already reviewed in the youtube. 

After much threatning  and retorhic they took us in . How ever they never apologised  for their behaviour and attitude that is why I am writing this , since I don't take this as serious in my old age when we become  more tolerant when we have other issues to worry about. so our encounter with the management was very unplesant  at the very beginning  to start with, we being travellers all over the world with so much experience .

Though we left  S.L 42 years ago we have travelled all round the world and we love our country and the people who are mostly freindly and honest. The island is a paradise

However the front desk became very friendly and courteuos afterwards having come to know that we are one of a kind

So my advice for any one coming in for a beach front ,and to enjoy peace and tranquility during their vacation you may want to go to east coast like Pasikudah on Nilaveli or south coast like Bentota and so many other which we have been when we were resident there more than 42 years ago","Management pulling a fast one","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5892306-r939547132-Mirage_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The staff are fantastic and very helpful. The WIFI is great, The TV had some good channels for westerners and the bar is good with reasonably priced drinks. 

The down side was our room stank of cigarettes, the shower was cold for our entire stay in both the rooms we stayed in and we tried multiple times throughout the day/night for a hot shower. I believe this is due to the hotel using solar power, which is a great idea if it works.

The breakfasts were the best meals and we had a buffet dinner which was ok, however we felt it was overpriced. 

To finish on a positive, they did have a live band playing at dinner which was nice and on both occasions our room was on the 8th floor which gave us a great view of the ocean.

The hotel was nice and clean. We went to the restaurant for lunch and it was reasonably priced and nice food. 

I would have said a very good review but the staff were rude to me. The pool is open 8am-8pm, it clearly says the times in their in room service guide and on the doors to the pool. When we went to use it at 7.40pm we were told we couldn't as it was closed. This was really annoying as we had come home early from dinner specifically to use it. We only stayed there as we wanted a pool so I could do my water rehabilitation therapy whilst travelling. When I phoned reception about it they were rude and said no it's open until 7.45, I said it says 8pm everywhere, ""well you would have only had 15min in the pool anyway"". I tried to explain that 15min was all I needed, and we came home in time. Then they hung up. Rude. 

Cool view of the beach and the train that goes past. No one swimming at the beach as it looked rocky and dangerous. Probably not the best location for what we wanted, we should have stayed closer to the train station, as it was busier there. But only around a $2USD tuk tuk ride to the main area.

Around $25USD taxi to the airport.

The room was quite dark, with drawers hard to open and nowhere to dry wet swimwear, which were left on sticky wooden chairs on the balcony. Unfortunately being all inclusive puts you on a different lunchtime menu, which is sometimes was in Chatters bar/restaurant. The Franzipani restaurant was closed. We waited over an hour and a quarter for the different courses and eventually left before the desserts arrived! You get one bottle of water each, once a day, but none available at breakfast or the bar, unless you pay extra. No bottled beer for all inclusive, limited poor quality cocktails, Breakfast was often barely warm. We told the lady, who asks you every meal if everything was ok. She asked for our room number and said that she would tell the chef. The trains run behind the hotel sometimes from 04.00 in the morning, very noisy.

For dinner, we had ordered food from the A-la Carte menu. We could see the sunset at the Ventura beach and it was bustling with locals. Also, the passing train noise kept us amused through the evening/night. The morning Breakfast buffet was very ordinary and mediocre. It was more catering to the European taste-buds hence could only enjoy the Eggs and toast. 

On the last day we had dinner at the Chatters and it was too salty for our taste but the saving grace was the cultural display at 9:30pm by the local artists. It was a nice and earnest performance by the team.

Overall, the propery is big and spacious but without the Kids pool or any play area. Food options are not that great, but the Gym and other amenties looked good.

Alles in allem ist es ein schönes Hotel mit sehr tollem Strand und Lage. Da es nicht so groß ist (was uns sehr gefällt) hat es auch schnell eine persönliche Atmosphäre. 

Wir hatten ein sehr schönes und großes Delux-Zimmer mit Meerblick und Gartenansicht - super schön, da es auch hier viele tolle Tiere wie z.B. Streifenhörnchen und schöne bunte Vögel 🐦 gibt. 

Leider sind die Liegen und Tischchen in einem sehr herunter gekommenen Zustand! Auch die Strandtücher sind extrem verschließen.

Das Essensangebot war durchweg sehr gut und abwechslungsreich. 

Hygiene im Restaurant:
Hier ist noch SEHR VIEL Luft nach oben! Alle Tische UND SITZFLÄCHEN werden mit ein und dem selben Lappen abgewischt. Dieser wird aber nicht 1x zwischendurch ausgetauscht geschweige denn ausgewaschen! Was aber ebenfalls extrem widerlich ist, sind die Platzsets, diese bekommt jeder Gast immer wieder als Unterlage mit allen Speise- und Getränketückständen der vorherigen Gäste! Diese Sets werden NIE gewechselt oder gereinigt!!!! Auch die Kleidung des Serviceteams im Restaurant ist eine wahre Zumutung! Die Vorgesetzten bekommt alle top gepflegte und passende Dienstkleidund aber das Serviceteam, welches den Gast versorgt, bekommt alte zerschlissene 
und oft nicht passende Dienstkleidung. Leider ist diese dann auch noch sehr schmutzig. 

Personal:
Wir können hier nur das gesamte Personal mit denen wir zu tun hatten sehr loben für deren Aufmerksamkeit und Freundlichkei. 

All-inclusiv ist hier nicht gleich All-inclusiv:
Hier sind wir doch sehr überrascht und verärgert, wie dies in diesem Hotel gehandhabt wird. Siehe hierzu auch das Foto der Hotelregel. Selbstverständlich ist es normal, daß nur Landesübliche alkoholische Getränke angeboten werden und internationale extra verrechnet werden. Aber das nur wenige  ausgesuchte Cocktails angeboten werden und alle anderen extra berechnet werden mit ca. 10 - 15 Euro. Auch die Getränke bei der Beachparty wurden extra verlangt wie z. B. ein Aperol-Spriz (0,2 ml) für ca. 12 Euro. Auch ein Cappuccino in der Cafebar wurde mit ca. 5 Euro extra verlangt. Leider kann man aber einem echten Cappuccino nicht erwarten, obwohl die Voraussetzungen gegeben wären. Alles in allem kann man sagen, daß Management hat überhaupt keinen Sinn für das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis und den Begriff ALL-INCLUSIVE!!!

Als Entschädigung für die einen oder anderen Unannehmlichkeiten wurden wir zum Ende des Aufenthalts zu einem Dinner eingeladen. Dieses war sehr schön und unglaublich lecker, nur leider viel zu viel  - den Haupgang hätten gut und gerne 4 Personen essen können. Uns tat es in der Seele leid, so viel zurück gehen zu lassen. Trotz allem, finden wir, dass weitere Gäste genau Bescheid wissen sollten,  was sie für ihr Geld bekommen.","Schönes Hotel - ABER ...!","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r986442438-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Wir wurden zuerst in ein Superior Zimmer gebucht obwohl ein Deluxe Zimmer auf unserem Voucher stand. Nach Reklamation bekamen wir dann das gebuchte Zimmer welches sehr schön und groß war. Die Bäder waren jedoch in beiden Zimmern renovierungsbedürftig. 

Positiv zu erwähnen ist der wunderschöne Aussenbereich und die Lage am Meer. Außerdem hat das Hotel eine Solaranlage was sehr zukunftsorientiert ist. 

Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit- Küche, Service, Etage ( Danke hier an Saman und Tharanga)

Leider besteht der Eindruck, dass das Management nicht gut auf seine Mitarbeiter schaut - die  Arbeitskleidung ist bei vielen schmutzig und oft auch zerrissen. Die Kleidung müsste täglich vom Hotel gereinigt und zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Ein Muss wenn man als Hotel in der höheren Kategorie mitspielen will.

Insgesamt ist es ein in die Jahre gekommenes, etwas schmuddeliges Hotel mit durchschnittlichem Essen.

We stayed for 2 nights on half-board basis. The room was clean and comfortable. The beach cannot be seen from the room. But there is a fantastic beach just a minute away. It is perfect for long walks in the evening. The A la carte menu and the beverages at the open bar had a good variety.  The breakfast buffet had a wide range of options. Overall, the food was excellent. The only negative point was that since it was off-season, dinner was a set menu instead of a buffet. So, I would recommend that at off-season times, book B & B only and order other meals through A la carte. The highlight of our stay was the hospitality of the staff. Vasana from the reception, the restaurant staff Sudesh, Mendis, Kalindu, Vikum, Kalum, Dasun, Promodya, and all other staff made our stay especially memorable.","Relaxing Stay","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r964194371-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The grounds and pool were nice but you had to look for pool towels and the sun beds that had mattresses on were very dirty and most didn’t. The water to wash your feet when coming off the sand was rarely refilled. The breakfast was disappointing - juice in those large cafe containers, yogurt not near fruit, croissants stale, floor of restaurant not very clean. I ate out at the local restaurants the rest of the time which more than made up for the hotel.","Disappointing","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r942865450-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It’s a very modern hotel but small, with one bar and one restaurant. Staff were friendly, if slow serving, and the food was excellent. The public beach is beautiful but the hotel was nowhere near the standard of hotel we stayed in around the island. Although I don’t like writing negative reviews, there are significant hotel flaws which I wish we had had known about before booking. There are a number of reasons why we wouldn’t stay at the hotel again, mainly stemming from poor management:

1. the hotel makes it clear that it is close to a railway line and there might be some “occasional noise”. It does not make it clear that it’s very close to the station and that you are woken by the 6.00am Mail train each morning - if you manage to sleep through that there is little chance with the 6.30am train. The trains are far more numerous and noisier than expected and a major disturbance
2. the hotel is by a beautiful beach but the hotel is at pains to say that it’s a public beach and nothing to do with them. Signs and instructions on arrival make it plain that you are not allowed to take hotel towels to the beach and there are no hotel sun beds on the beach either which we were looking forward to. The hotel grounds are lovely but there’s a desperate need for new sun beds and parasols - there are currently far too few and the existing beds and mattresses need replacing as they’re in very poor condition 
3. the poorly thought through  business model of catering for B&B, Breakfast and half board at lunch or evening and all inclusive. As the hotel refuses to ask guests to wear coloured wrist bands you are constantly asked for your room number and have to sign for all drinks from the bar, including water and coffee. This is an incredibly slow and antiquated paper based system which makes service even more pedestrian 
4. as a result of their business model numbers for lunch are often too small to open the buffet at the Breeze restaurant, so you are forced to eat instead from the very limited a la carte or snack menu in the chatters bar. We ate there three days out of 5. Due to the chaotic organisation lunch took over an hour when you just wanted to be outside and tables were very slow to be cleared
5. the all inclusive offer is limited, ending at 10.00pm, and there is no all day snack bar. Bizarrely whilst red and white wine were readily available, they refused to sell Rosé wine by the glass - instead asking you to buy a bottle for 14,200 rupees or £38! We queried the price three times and were given the same price each time. 
6. Despite the pride over the architectural design there are clear flaws. The open reception area is lovely but the corridors on the upper level are dark and unfriendly with 2 deeply unattractive concrete stairways to the pool area. In addition guests with rooms to the south end have to walk through the Chatters bar after visiting the beach or pool, and Speedo trunks are neither attractive or healthy when you are eating 
7. Our Deluxe room was very large and airy with a nice balcony but it was cleaned in 6 minutes. The shower cubicle wasn’t cleaned properly during our whole stay

We raised our points with management several times but there was no response, and managers only became visible around the hotel after our second complaint. They had no answer for the scam with the Rosé wine. We had a very nice five day stay but the hotel should be so much better and aim for better quality and customer experience. It’s not a bad hotel but it was nowhere near the standard of the other excellent hotels we stayed at.","Nice Hotel but what I would have liked to know before booking","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r941407560-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We were shown to our room and our luggage was carried to our room by 2 porters. ( they do expect a tip of course !) The room was clean and the bathroom was large and had a collection of toiletries, ( shampoo, conditioner & shower gel) - a decent hairdryer was also provided. Our room was cleaned regularly and sheets and towels were changed on a daily basis. We did find the guys who cleaned the room to be a little over friendly- randomly knocking on our door - almost every day-
to see if we’d liked the towel display on our bed - which could’ve been a swan/ 2 swans/ elephant- you get the gist ! Sometimes even stepping into our room - which I felt was a little intrusive. This was obviously in the hope of receiving a tip - which we did give on a regular basis- but then found they started loitering around our room - it was almost as if they knew what time of day we were going back to our room! A point to mention also is that there is a train line running parallel to the front of the hotel which you could hear anytime from around 4.30 in the morning - it almost felt like the train would be ploughing its way right through your room on occasions.
There are 2 large swimming pools and a couple of small pools for children. There are plenty of Sun loungers and towels which you get from a little hut next to the main pool. The towels could do with being renewed -some looked a bit grubby, however, they always smelled freshly laundered-mattresses for Sun loungers could do with  being upgraded- looked a little grubby , but they served their purpose. The pool area was kept tidy although could do with a good old power wash in places. 
Now onto food- we were staying half board - so it was breakfast and  dinner. Breakfast was your normal selection of fruit , jams , bacon - various egg dishes, salads , bread , curry etc. 2 people cooking omelettes and bacon & tea, coffee and fruit juices. Dinner was a variety of beef,pork,seafood, rices, salads & puddings. Nothing spectacular- but we did not go hungry. My one criticism was that the food was not very hot. Service was okay - a case of the highest tippers received the better service ! We did eat in the snack bar a couple of times & the food was good and nicely presented. All food/ drinks purchased have a service charge added of 10% & v.a.t on top of the price on the menus. My husband and I ordered a couple of burgers one day which was around 4400 Sri Lankan Rupees & then an additional 1200 was added onto the bill. Just bear this in mind if/when tipping! There is also a lack of entertainment- I would not like to think we had been there for a fortnight with teenagers- there was a pool table and a few games/ books but that was it. It was a case of back to your room after dinner as there was nothing going on.
The beach was okay but not the brilliant white sands of the Caribbean. We walked the length and breadth of the whole beach outside of the hotel and found some parts to be littered with plastic bottles etc. We even found a hyperdermic needle one day- this could’ve been washed up I suppose. The sea was very choppy and red flags were up for the full 6 days we were there. We did go in for a dip to say we’d been in the Indian Ocean, but you could not swim in it as there were undercurrents.
You can walk into Bentota town which take’s around 10 minutes across the bridge & we did spot couple of crocodiles!! Bentota is not the cleanest as in most cases in Sri Lanka but we only went for a few snacks &a bottle of gin from the liquor store which cost around £12.50. Shops selling dried fish and fresh fish, chillis and other spices. It was an experience. We did not feel threatened or uncomfortable walking into town as long as you are prepared for a bit of hassle from tuk tuk/taxi drivers and shop vendors- but everyone has to make a living & as long as you are firm and polite they tend to let you walk on by & get the message eventually.
On our last day we checked out and then about an hour before we were to leave we were hunted down by one of the ladies in reception and asked to leave a review on trip advisor- she was very adamant we did it there & then and hovered over us until we’d completed one and submitted it. We felt very pressurised into doing this and at the time felt we could not be completely honest and the who scenario was pretty uncomfortable. They are obviously under a lot of pressure from management to make sure good reviews are posted and negative reviews are not welcomed. We had a pleasant stay but this was not as pleasurable as our stay at the Melheim resort in the hills where we could have stayed for longer and the service there was exemplary.","A pleasant stay","2023-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r895522806-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We had a mixed experience during our stay and felt that given the price and the category of room we selected, service and experience needs to improve. The resort is located right on the beach. Check in was quick. We had selected the beach view rooms so view wise one room had proper view other a partial view. Rooms were quite large. But other than that quite a bit of negative points. 1. During our check-in to the room we found that room service cart was next to our room and stayed there till next morning. As there was waste, cleaning material etc. in it, there was a weird smell from there. 2. Cockroach in the bathroom! Not expected this. But next morning we also found one near the main door of the room (we think due to the garbage that was stored right outside our room)! 3. The other two points could be overlooked - but guess what during our second day at the resort in the evening we got a call from the reception asking what time we will check out the next morning! Really?? This is the first time we had such an experience! Only if we are close to check out time or past the check out time should the reception be calling us and asking about this! And during check in we had clearly told them as we have a noon flight we will check out post breakfast. So was not really happy with this. 

The good part:
The best experience was the restaurant! Thanks to the restaurant, I rated this resort higher. When we reached the restaurant for dinner, again we found limited options for vegetarians. But the manager was prompt to spot that we are vegetarians and immediately even got us a couple of veg dishes. He further stated from next morning we will have a good spread of veg food! And true to his promise, for the next two days we enjoyed the best food. The manager also came in regularly to check as well as the restaurant staff to see that we were happy with the food being served. Thanks to the restaurant service and food, I rated the resort higher!
Second good part was that its right on the beach with direct access to the beach. 

So overall, given the price point I would definitely consider other options and maybe come over to the restaurant for the food!.","Avani Bentota - Mixed experience - Great Location & Restaurant but rest needs improvement","2023-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r892563597-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Boring, dated & tired decor. As it was our wedding anniversary, we wanted something special.  However, the standard room we were in had an awful damp smell.  So we asked for an upgrade, which we eventually got, but had to pay for the privilege. This is advertised as a 4 star hotel. It's not. 3 stars at best. Very average. 

Good location. Nice places to eat a short walk away. Hotel restaurant average -nothing to get excited about. 

Unfortunately we were visiting when all kicked off with the COVID-19, coronavirus outbreak.  I was disgusted at the hotels greediness at this time of national disaster.  They doubled their prices, when other hotels in the area were about helping people and offered generous discounts, just in case we got stranded before the airports shut down. 

Staff did their best, Friendly and attentive - too much so at times. We always tip generously, However they hassle you and hang around, expecting the same tips every day - greedy traits following through... maybe they're trained that way?!

We visited 2 other local hotels along the beach, which were far more superior for not  a lot extra, in fact some were less than the Avani.

If you're looking for 4/5 star luxury, then this isn't the place for you!

Staff nice and helpful people, location good, beach fantastic,  cleanliness pretty good, rooms... food.... Price...

Rooms - I would say spacious but also a little dated, nothing wrong just a bit old!  Shower was good. 

Food - My suggestion is eat somewhere else!  Certainly not good value for money. Organise a little and go outside to the right of the resort, a “strip” of restaurants such as Rana, Mallis and the secret garden. All better food and value. We ate 3 or 4 at the resort, the Greek salad was the best meal! Which was actually different to my wife’s at the same time??

Price - Reasonable value in the sense that it was reasonable for what we paid (£1400)  for 6 nights.. but there are plenty of deals with surrounding resorts.. 

Location to the beach was excellent and the beach itself was also excellent, also very quiet. 

Pool - there are 2 pools, one is a really nice pool, the other is less so and highlights what I’ve said, a little dated. 

One element that is good is the sun-bed control,  they have a couple of guys putting these out for you and after a few days they know who is who and of course cross my palm with silver and you will be well looked after sir! Which was gladly done and no complaints.

My comment to reception would be please accept that there are many places outside to eat, they didn’t really want to offer any suggestions due to having 3 places on site for eating..   however, know that just outside to the right (about 200mts) is a strip (as above) has about 5/6 places to eat.. follow the railway line.. they are great places with good prices and super food.  

All in all, it’s in no way a place to avoid, just don’t expect the world and you will be very happy. ","Reviews need Reviews! ","2020-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315668-r748438844-Thaala_Bentota-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Overall, we were expecting the facility to be cleaner and better maintained because of; 1. The pricing of the hotel, 2. The nice photos online and 3. Our experience at another hotel was better although that hotel was a 3star establishment with older infrastructure but well maintained.

Their facility is outdated and not true to picture. I wish I had taken a photo to do the comparison but neither my friend nor I were excited enough about the room that we did not take any. It’s one of those “Instagram vs Reality” moment. 

The details if you are interested...👇🏻
Pros:
Room was spacious and had plenty of room for luggage
Free bottled water
Good food
Good service although sometimes we felt that we were not well informed...
The swimming pools were up to our expectation! 

Cons:
Outdated facility, needs a revamp!
Our room was missing a bathtub... (our bathroom had a weird open space, we compared it to the picture on booking.com and realized that a bathtub was supposed to be there)
We had a vent connected to employee only corridor - we can hear everything going on in the backdoors and it was a little distracting at night

The answer is a definite no!! It should be half the going rate as it is quite tired, service is okay with a downside if everyone looking for a tip.

Food is rather average so lower your expectation. With only 50 rooms they cannot put on a big spread so menu is a little limiting.

Pros:

The hotel has a fascinating history, having been a former tea production facility. Historical details are shared in the lobby, and some original components of the production process are still visible.
It is surrounded by beautiful tea plantations, offering a tranquil and picturesque setting.
The staff were friendly and accommodating, adding a personal touch to our stay.

Cons:

The hotel is remote, about 30 minutes from Nuwara Eliya, with no dining options nearby. Unfortunately, the food quality was disappointing. The signature dish was underwhelming, with overcooked chicken, and prices were high.
Rooms are outdated and in need of modernization, with no bedside outlets, which is inconvenient in today’s tech-reliant world.
Accessibility could be improved; the high-entry bathtub is not suitable for guests with mobility issues.
The breakfast was overly expensive and didn’t deliver value for money.
Immediately after dinner, we were presented with a QR code and pressured to write a review. While this explains the large number of reviews on Tripadvisor, we found the ratings to be inflated compared to our experience. This approach is likely a strategy chosen by the management, and we want to emphasize that the staff should not be blamed for it. However, for such an expensive hotel, this tactic leaves a poor impression and feels out of place given the otherwise unique and historic setting.

In summary, the hotel’s historical charm, scenic location, and friendly staff are appealing, but the experience is let down by subpar dining, outdated amenities, and questionable review practices that don’t align with the premium pricing or setting.","Charming Historical Setting with Room for Improvement","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r982803527-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Okay for the problems 
The moment you walk through the door they try to upsell you
Tours are this
Spa is this
Dinning carriage is this, well the dinning carriage is a joke. 130usd for an 8 course menu which looks to serve very similar to the buffet
This was on top of whatever board basis you were on. I would have expected a supplement charge depending on your room basis.
Service was dreadful. Although staff are very polite, never removed our plates we had to stack them on a nearby table. As although the tables are adequate they are quite small
Some desserts are served in a shot glass however no tea spoons are provided so I less you use your fingers cannot eat it.
When we asked for tea spoons the look of disgust from staff was in believe
Reception service os poor. Twice we had to asked for something to fix something the room as never turned up first time
Twice we had to ask for a porter to help with checkout. Yet when try move bags yourselves they are very upset

Overall it's not a 4 staff it's a 3 star trying to be a 5 star.

The staff were lovely, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I can’t fault the staff at all.

However I feel this hotel is significantly overpriced.

The rooms look very dated and tired. The carpets are worn, the decor is tired and in some places grubby/showing significant signs of wear and tear.

The bathroom in particular was not a nice experience. The bath requires a large step up as it’s almost waist height for some reason. I had dislocated my knee three week’s prior to travelling and this caused me significant pain and difficulty.  

The grout around the bath is partly black and the whole room and bathroom felt like it was overdue a significant refurb.

Basically the reception area looks good, the rest of the hotel is similar to what you might expect of 2 to 3 stars in a European country.

The food was ‘okay’. It felt like it catered much more for Indian and Sri Lankan guests which is fine, but for the cost of making a curry in Sri Lanka with largely locally sourced ingredients the mark up was huge!

I felt it was significantly overpriced compared to similar priced hotels in Sri Lanka.

Additional activities are offered by the hotel but they are all at quite significant prices. I wouldn’t mind paying those prices if I thought the money was being passed on to the staff involved but I suspect the large mark ups go to the hotel itself and given that they don’t seem to be using these huge mark ups to invest in necessary ongoing maintenance and refreshing the decor it seems frankly just greedy?

The spa and gym look stuck in the 1980s.

Personally I would recommend looking at other hotels in this area like Jetwing.","Great Staff, Tired & Dated Rooms","2023-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r889672036-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Dinner and breakfast are up the standard but it's crazy that with the prices they are charging all the activites they are offering are not included! 
They wanted to charge us to use to biliard too!

Also the service is not at the standard of what they are charging. 
We order lunch a la carte one day and we waited more than an hour for the food to arrive.
Every one is nice and kind and very attentive but one hour for food with 2 kids...and price 5 times more than the rest of Sri Lanka... (and the lunch did not have an outstandig quality at all)
Our waiter during our dinners (Kewani) was amazing, he understood the kids did not want to spend 2 hours at the table every dinner and it was super helpful to bring food and change some dishes considering our needs.

We could hear people sneezing, coughing, everything.   Our first night we arrived here and I have to get to the reception to complain that the people above us were really loud.  The staff arranged this perfectly and gave us another room and we even ended up in the grand suite with an apology from the staff.   
During our stay of 3 nights we had breakfast and dinner.   Breakfast I will be really blunt about it, was just not good.  The viennoiserie tasted stale and old,  there were  scrambled eggs which were cold, bacon was cold, and you just did not have that many choice. In the weekend breakfast was via a buffet formula and during the week was a la carte.   Dinner in our case  was a la carte where you could choose from various courses leaving you with a dinner appetizer, starter, soup, sorbet, main, desert, coffee.   I must say, some courses were ok, but some were really not that good.  All and all in my opinion defenetly not a hotel I will be back at and honestly there are much nicer hotels in the region then this for much cheaper.

The road from the Kandapola town to the hotel is an even harder drive as it was a very small concrete road. We had to get off the road twice to make way to 2 oncoming lorries. 
However, the hotel was a magnetic tea factory and the staff was very helpful. At times they came across as being too helpful/friendly. The hotel was covered in mist throughout our stay so booking this hotel in December may not be a good idea. We did tea tasting and learned a lot about tea manufacturing process.
Also, there were only a few guests so they only offered a set menu for dinner.
We stayed at Jetwin St. Andrew's on the first day and we felt that St. Andrew's was much better overall. Heritance Tea Factory charges premium prices but couldn't come close to Jetwin in any aspect.

We were on a tour to SriLanka for 7 nights out of which we had planned 2 nights here. The beauty of the place is beyond imagination. BUT, a few instances took place that made me wonder if I had taken a wrong call booking this property and for sure will not refer this hotel to my friends and family. The most disappointing thing was that at the time of Check-out, inspite of exchanging my currency to LKR (SriLankan Rupees) I was forced to pay in Dollars ($). After atleast a 15 mins discussion that when I already have LKR then why should I pay in $ or by card? No one agreed to my requests. Then when I did pay them in $ (cash), the change given back to me was in LKR. The surprising point is that their exchange rate was much lesser than the one we would have gotten from bank/airport. (Atleast 15 LKR less). On asking the change back in $ they started showing me their company policy. I mean when I am ready to pay in your own currency you dont want that then you want to return the change back to me in your currency. What a Joke. Extremely shameful.

One more incident took place on the 2nd day when I asked for a water bottle for my room and I was refused saying that it will be chargeable infact all the water bottles which were given to me on daily basis will be charged to my account. It was so surprising because this is not at all a standard practice and water is something which is given free to the room. I think they were expecting me to go to the restaurant and ask them for a glass of water everytime I felt thirsty.

All their practices were to make more and more money. I regretted my decision of booking a stay here. Their are many other beautiful properties in Nuwara Eliya.  
This review was to aware tourists planning to visit this property. If you Dont mind the discomfort I faced during my stay you can definitely book this property for it’s view and experience of staying inside a tea factory. 
Also, if the property decides to change their policy after this review, I would give them 5 star for the stay.","Beware!!

It is truly a regret for our Heritance Tea Factory team to receive such reviews from our valued guests as we always endeavor to offer a stay that either meets or exceeds all expectations. 

As Heritance Tea Factory is a longstanding factory converted into a hotel, we thank our guests for their understanding that that they are surrounded by gypsum walls. We also inform of this to all our guests. However, the walls are made so that the noise could be heard only at a certain level of decibels.

The mentioned concern regarding the bathroom facility is well noted and will be looked in to in our upcoming renovation project. We regret for any inconvenience experienced as a result. 

Many of our guests highly endorse and recommend the culinary experience offered by us and our dining staffs' service, thus we truly regret to note that you felt otherwise. However, we have taken your comment constructively and will be looking in to enhancing the same.  

We hope this experience would not deter you from visiting us again as we look forward to offering you a more memorable hotel experience during your next visit to Sri Lanka.

Once we arrived we didn’t venture out given the road leading to the hotel was difficult and uncomfortable to navigate. You also need to bring warm clothes here as it’s freezing! This took us by surprise. Restaurant serves a good breakfast and dinner - both a la carte and buffet available. And there’s a bar serving snacks and drinks all day. Room was comfortable and spacious although as others have mentioned you can hear pretty much every noise from adjoining rooms and outside.

Thank you for sharing your valuable feedback with us on Google which will further assist us in our continuous improvement. 

While we are pleased to note your positive comments on the room facility and the tea plucking experience, it is with great regret we note your difficulties experienced during your journey to our hotel. 

Kindly note that the Heritance Tea Factory Management and staff together we had carried out our best efforts to assist you with arriving to the other side of the water on to our side safely. Unfortunately, at the time, none of our vehicles including the four-wheel jeep could do so as the water level was too high to drive through. Furthermore, due to the traffic congestion, the van and the jeep which were kept to pick up guests could not be moved too as all the vehicles were stuck until the water level went down. However, we hired a bus which could go in the water and managed to meet you and bring your safely to the hotel. We thank you for your understanding that the delay was caused due to reasons beyond our control and our team were looking for best possible solutions at all times.  While this was taking place all guests and drivers whom we were in contact were briefed about the situation and were updated on it. 

Unfortunately, at this time, we could not contact you and will be taking necessary measures to ensure clear communication take place in situations like this in the future. Kindly note that in such weather conditions, which happens very rarely, we have to depend only on the Police and the villagers, as we do not have any boats or any other equipment in or around this area. 

We regret if you felt unwanted as we always welcome our guests warmly and are appreciative to all those who keep trust in Heritance Tea Factory for their stay. 

The front desk team are informed to ensure that all guests are well introduced about the facilities and services provided. 

We regret to note that your expectations of the culinary experience were not met and have shared your comments with our Executive Chef and Food and Beverage Manager advising to look in to the same.

We would like to take this opportunity to inform our valued guests that many aspects of the hotel will be enhanced, and facilities including the bathrooms, will be improved in our upcoming renovation project while some will be addressed immediately in our routine maintenance work.

We hope this experience will not deter you from visiting us again as we look forward to offering you a more pleasant hotel experience during your next stay.

The Pluses

1. Rooms are well kept. The bed and linen are extremely comfortable but could be a little bit short for tall people.
2. The views are excellent both at the tea plantations or mountains 
3. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Top notch. I also liked the uniform
4. There is a tea factory you can visit and if you want to can also pick tea. They provide you with all what is needed
5. Well maintained old facilities. At the basement (use stairs from the ground floor towards the spa)   there is old engine plus historical pictures. Worth visiting.  At the reception area you can taste all types of tea.
6. House keeping is top notch. The bed is very comfortable and the linen/pillows are the best I have ever seen. Housekeeping  need to be congratulated. The rooms are very clean

Areas of improvement
1. We got stuck due to heavy rains and high water some 6 km from hotel and 2 km to Kandapola. We had to wait 4 hrs before some help came despite calling the hotel and speaking to them several times promising the car is coming. We later rescued together with other 10 hotel guests by hotel staff. We know rain and police control is beyond hotel management but the point is we were stuck with no call back or any feedback or even saying sorry we cant do anything . We were about to find another hotel when we saw hotel jeep. I understand it is difficult to deal with such cases but hotel management must have some kind of crises or disaster management plans. What was more disturbing is that the manager was there when we reached the hotel. He stood and did not even come to the guests and interact or inquire. It gave me a feeling these things happen all the time during heavy rains. Management plse ensure feedback to guests when they are in this kind of situation (we felt unwanted since we kept calling the hotel and no  return calls or update despite having our contacts - becoz we called them)
2. No introduction about all available hotel facilities. Everything we found by chance 
3. Variety and quality of food is not as Heritance Kandalama. I think something needs to be done. Visit them and see. Also dinner starts at 730pm to some it is a little bit late. 
4. The bathtub cum shower is very high. You have to use a stool to climb. One has to be extremely careful. I hope no accident will happen.

At Jetwing Lagoon, we hope to inspire our guests to follow a mindful approach towards relaxation and digital-detox, and our in-room amenities are designed to facilitate this, hence the reason for not having TVs in the rooms. Thank you for the idea of adding seating by the lagoon-facing garden and we will explore the possibility of creating a more relaxing space for our guests there. We also appreciate your comments on the second pool and will look into enhancing the ambiance and adding more facilities for a better experience.

The rooms were absolutely amazing. Room service options were great and worth the price. The pools, yes pools, there are two, one within and once across the street. Both are amazing - you can watch the sunset from the pool across the street.

The bad:
This started with the booking. We had a booking made by a friend as a gift, which we confirmed before arrival but once we arrived we were told we had to make the full payment. Their bookings through booking.com is apparently irrelevant to the hotel. This is fine, there are different procedures but they made a huge fuss and was unapologetic about it making it super awkward between us and our friends. Took us over an hour to sort things and check-in. Some attitude they’ve got.

The mehs:
The buffet was just meh and for their prices I might have to say it wasn’t really worth it.

The plusses:
The spa, massages, are great, they do have a doctor in-house so the treatment you get is methodical and you can feel it but it is a bit pricey. The view of the lagoon is great throughout the day and at night. The guy who gave us the buggy ride as we checked out was one of the few staff members who would go above and beyond to make a guest smile!

Overall okay. But I can’t whole heartedly give any more stars because having been to many other Jetwing hotels, this being one of the most expensive ones, customer service wasn’t great.

Greetings from Jetwing Lagoon Negombo!

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at Jetwing Lagoon. Your comments are invaluable to us as they provide insights into areas where we can improve and enhance our guest experience.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay. Your concerns about the noise from the nearby church, the condition of the gym, internet speed, hot water availability, and the overall value for money have been duly noted. Please accept our apologies for falling short of your expectations in these aspects.

Regarding the noise from the church, particularly during the special mass held on Sunday night, we regret any disturbance caused. We are actively exploring measures to minimize disruptions arising from external factors beyond our control.

We are equally disappointed to learn about your experiences with the gym facilities, internet connectivity, and the hot water in the bathtub. Rest assured, we are addressing these issues promptly to ensure that future guests do not encounter similar challenges.

We regret that your experience has led you to reconsider staying at Jetwing hotels in the future. We earnestly hope you might reconsider and grant us another opportunity, especially as we plan significant improvements, including a refurbishment scheduled for next year. We invite you to revisit Jetwing Lagoon to experience the enhancements and exceptional service that Jetwing is renowned for.

Should you have any further concerns or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Your patronage is appreciated, and I am grateful for the chance to address the issues you've kindly brought to our attention.

Ayubowan! (May you have a long life),

But Jetwing Lagoon has a much nicer Lagoon front and the waves break against the property without any obstruction. The pool too is very long and beautiful  and there are two life guards on duty from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Food is reasonably good and the service is very personal and good except for the old slice of lime that came with the gin and mature asparagus served with the mains. The main Restaurant is not air conditioned there is a breeze but it gets hot

The Breakfast buffet is very poorly manned. For instance the pancake and waffle station has no one they are to make them. And because they have physically separated the pork bacon and sausage station from the chicken sausage station the same guy has to keep running between the two and the guests have to wait until he swings back. Guests are also short changed with only local cheddar cheese, hand cut cubes of butter floating in a open bowl of ice instead of sealed hygienic sachets of butter. Coffee and tea are served to the tables but there is no second serving unless you succeed in getting the attention of the server and request. There are no supervisors to be seen anywhere. The stewards seem to run the show.

There is a Happy hour from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. but that's only for the bar that is indoors and that too, only 20% off on local spirits.

The rooms are scattered out all over the property. Still there is no privacy as the rooms are in rows next to each other. But there is a lot of walking to get to the rooms. The rooms are very claustrophobic, rather small and no lake views . It's overall a very boring hotel set far far away from the  lively part of Negombo. The sea and lagoon are not usable and therefore useless.","A very boring hotel","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r746077886-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Rest of the room was acceptable. Huge pool but drink service non existent.  Drinks finally turned up after about one hour but got order wrong.   Complained and F&B Manager (Name Mr. Seemon I think who is trying his best) turned up and apologised.  Hotel is obviously relying on wedding groups for business which is understandable in tough times.  But they cannot neglect other guests.  Had to carry our own sun loungers as not enough staff.  What is the point in having a huge pool if services cannot be provided to support it. People were getting into pool with normal clothes so hygiene questionable.  That evening the F&B Manager assigned a waiter to take care of us and the young man who served us at dinner did a very good good job so thank you to him and F&B Manager.  Clearly the staff will do better with proper guidance.  We asked to talk to the General Manager and was told he is busy in his office.  That sums up the problem for this hotel.  It needs a hands on GM who goes around checking servces and not one who spends time in hs office while services are shambolic.

However, the restaurant disappointed on both occasions, from taking 25 minutes to procure a pot of tea when we arrived mid-afternoon to being slow and rude over the evening meal. Proximity to the lagoon probably explains the number of mosquito bites and flies that accompanied our meal.
There isn't a lot to do in the immediate vicinity, though the ocean on the hotel's hundred yard beachfront is impressive. The main pool had been emptied and looked like an archaeological dig on our second visit.

We had a large, triple room with a separate living room area and a really nice outside modern bathroom with shower, tub, etc.  Except for the very weak wi-fi connection, the quality and comfort of the room was very good.   The property itself is also very nice, with a very large swimming pool (100 m long?), pleasant lawn area on the lagoon side, small ocean-side area and decent common/dining area.   Where things start to fall apart was with the inconsistent and poor service level of the staff.   From taking + 20 mins to check-in because the staff were too busy chatting with each other, to +40 min waiting for a simple lunch order in an empty restaurant (which they ended up getting the order partially wrong but we decided to accept their mistake instead of waiting even longer), to booking a hotel car to take us to the airport (more concerned about the payment - didn't even ask what time we wanted to depart), to room service  where we had to call 4 different times to place our order because the person on the other end wasn't sure what was available, said they would call us back and never did.  When the food did arrive, on dish was totally inedible.   The assist food & beverage manager did come to our room, recognize the issue, apologize and correct it. 

This is way too many problems for someone staying in this hotel for less than 24 hrs.  When you have so many service problems in a number of different areas, you really have a management problem.  This is a shame because the property itself is pretty nice.","Nice property, good rooms but really mixed service","2018-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r597785999-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

We read a lot about this chain and have just realized they are not customer first and don’t keep their properties updated.

When we arrived the hotel pool touted on all of their marketing materials was completely empty and under maintenance. NOONE from the hotel emailed us to warn us about the pool as we would have made other arrangements had we known. The staff at the hotel clearly cares less as well because not one person has apologized. Ruined the last two nights in Sri Lanka on a very amazing trip outside of our Jetwing
Stays. 

The food is mediocre at hotel. The issue is there are a LOT of mosquitoes and little being done about it. There’s also two very annoying cats that beg at your feet 1.) kind of grossing you out during dinner and 2.) makes you said because they’re starving. Wish the hotel would take care of this bc it’s very uncomfortable. 

Our first night the hot water did not work in our very cool outdoor bathroom: they finally fixed it. The bathroom is the highlight of this hotel. It’s indoor/outdoor and pretty spectacular but we would not stay here again just for that. The staff so far is not helpful at all and almost acts like we are a nuisance for asking for normal help...goes against everything we love about Sri Lanka. These corporate
Hotel are really screwing up the vibes. We wouldn’t stay here again. 

One last note the airport noise is SO loud it shakes the walls. ","Pool out of service, staff not helpful, rooms are ok ","2018-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r597363736-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

The bathroom sink caulking was peeling, there were scratch and scuff marks throughout the room, and stuff just did not work. The television repeatedly froze for no reason.  You don’t expect this from a five star hotel.  

The views are hit and miss.   They initially allocated us a room with a terrible view of the infill construction site despite being a Marriott Platinum Elite.   The front desk claimed it was an “ocean view”.  It was not.  Only after the front desk manager’s assistance did they allocate a better standard room.  

Where the ITC excels is its restaurants.  We ate at Avartara and Peshawri — both were outstanding.  Avartara in particular was terrific.  And the Ocean Pavilion breakfast buffet was equally great.  They also provided a nightly happy hour for elite guests on one of the upper floors - great food and drinks and live music.  

It’s a shame the hotel itself doesn’t match its restaurants and bars in terms of quality and experience.   It should, and if it did, it would be a world class property.  Unfortunately, at this point, it is not.   But it’s a new hotel and perhaps these issues can be worked out as the ITC has the potential of being the best hotel in Colombo.","Wonderful Food but Disappointing Rooms","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1001011690-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The Good
The Sky Bridge Lounge is a standout. I loved the no-children policy and the enforced dress code. It's rare to find a lounge that keeps things sophisticated. The weekend live band was a nice surprise and pretty good, though they could lean into more upbeat music. The lounge’s setup is too fantastic to stick with slow songs all night. On our last night, when they picked up the pace, the vibe transformed. People were chair dancing, singing, and mingling. It felt alive, the way it should. A special shoutout to Hasitha, whose local tips and friendly service made our trip to Sri Lanka much smoother.

The design of the hotel is beautiful. From the impressive lobby to the unique common spaces, it’s clear a lot of thought went into the aesthetics. Rooms with lake or sea views are a treat if you’re lucky enough to get one. The breakfast buffet was solid, with plenty of options, and the on-site Chinese restaurant exceeded expectations. Good food, fair pricing, and a large menu (though it really needs page numbers). The staff we did engage with were friendly and genuinely kind.

The Not-So-Good (the growing pains)
Cleanliness was not up to par. Crumbs on seats and couches in both lounges and uncleared tables at the breakfast buffet. It just didn’t feel like a luxury hotel. Sky bridge lounge buffet needs supervision as one incident was especially off-putting. I saw a guest after dining half their plate at their table put some food back onto the common serving platter. I was done after that.

Service was inconsistent, particularly in the lobby lounge. I stayed there for hours without being approached, even as other guests were attended to almost immediately. It felt like attention depended on who you were.

The Ugly
The rooms were the most disappointing part of the stay. At first, everything looks sleek. modern, and new... until your eyes adjust. For a hotel that opened in April, the level of wear and tear was shocking. Both rooms we stayed in had significant mildew and grime in the showers, water seeping through tiles outside the shower, rust-stained balconies, and poorly finished surfaces (scratched marble, paint on wood, etc). This place is going to have significant water issues. The mattress was rock-hard. If you’re a side sleeper, prepare for a sore shoulder. These aren’t the details you’d expect from an ITC property, and they really undermine the otherwise luxurious feel of the hotel.

Overall
ITC Ratnadpia has the potential to be a fantastic destination. The design is stunning, the lounge is a real highlight, and the pricing feels fair for what’s on offer, but this place feels like it was rushed to open and missing the precision associated with the ITC brand.","A Mixed Experience at ITC Ratnadpia","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r987157948-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Pros>>
Staff are very friendly and gives a good service. Matheesha is one of them. 
Marvelous and panoramic view is the main attraction. 
Live Piano music is very much suits for a evening. But wonder why the Saxophone and Cello came live only at last minute of the high tea hours. 

Cons>> 
Compare with Buffet spreads serve in other hotels in Colombo, high tea spread in ITC is very low rate in size. I can say the size is like 25% only to other hotels.
Priority given to sweets. Non of the items are spicy. 
Drinks are serve only on demand. Mainly available ice coffee only. 
No any hot service station for any meat items. 
However if you a sweets eater, this is ok to visit. 

Conclusion >> I request ITC management to review my comments given to Vidu and then give me a feedback. 
My opinion is value for money rate for high tea at ITC Ratnadipa is Rs4600. Otherwise you will get ""one time"" customers only. 
All the best.

However, layout of the property is very confusing till the time you get used to.  Reaching the lobby or the restaurants is very challenging unless you get used to it. I am surprised that someone did not think through this.

The staff is very courteous but the follow up on the service is missing. I asked for a hot pack, it was twice confirmed to me but never delivered till I had to escalate the issue with the duty manager. Similarly with the laundry service. I had to follow up 4 times before laundary was picked up. My package included 1 hr complementary spa. I was staying for 3 days but the spa was booked for all 3 days! What was the use of complementary spa package if no slot is available. Anyway, after pushing the issue with the duty manager, spa was promptly arranged.

The therapist assigned to me was Nilupa. She was amazing and very professional. She asked me my specific requirements, where she needs to focus. After that, for next 1 hour, I just slept off! My rating of 3/5 for ITC Ratnadipa is largely on account of wonderful experience with Nilupa.","Beautiful property needs improvement in service orientation ","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r978656283-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

I would say it is a good experience given that the ambience is unique and elegant.The staff ( especially Divyangi) on duty are very attentive and friendly,  which makes your overall dining experience in the Ahasa restaurant pleasant. Both the savoury and sweet items are of high quality and this is one of the most positive aspects of the high tea experience here. 

Things to improve:

Value for money. Of course the food quality is good but quantities they offer DO NOT do the justice to the money we pay. At a very high price point of 5375/-, each platter has a very limited amount of items that can barely cover even the plates. If this rate was for a high tea buffet rather than a platter, it would have been fair but we felt that these non-sharable platters are quite unreasonably priced. 

Overall, our experience was a mixture of both positive and poor observations of the high tea offered at ITC Rathnadipa.","High Tea @ ITC Rathnadipa.","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r961800184-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",
