95% of the staff are exceptional, in fact I had to stop them doing the simplest of things for me, however if you are there for a couple of days you do learn a handful of them are only paying lip service to you, not actually doing what they said they would
Then we have money. I was told I could boom drinks to the room on the first day & duly did with 1 roiled for less than a tenner. However at breakfast the next morning I was confronted by a stern looking gentleman explaining it was a mistake & I needed to pay. It seemed he posted a waiter at my table to escort me to my room immediately to settle up. I soon shoed him off, finished my breakfast in peace then returned to my room when 2 minutes later he was knocking at the door! I explained it would be settled within the next 15 minutes & made my way down to reception to sort it. They didn’t seem bothered at the harassment but I settled up & made it quite clear I didn’t want another knock at the door. Which is exactly what I got 30 minutes later!
I would have let it drop, even though they have a habit of presenting the bill halfway through a meal, but the icing on the cake was on the last night, in bed early for a 2am start when at 10am the phone rang followed by a knock at the door from the same guy saying I had a bill to settle up!

Hotel ok but needs a little tlc in places.OIn arrival we were met in reception, first hotel we have ever been to where we were not met with a welcome drink and after an epic over 7 hour drive to get there a drink would have been nice. We were given our all inclusive wrist bands and taken to our room. On arrival I asked for anniron as we had been living out of our suitcase for the previous week staying at various hotels, twice I went to reception to ask and finaly at the 3rd attempt and at 2230 an iron was sent to our room. All inclusive is not worth it here, you could have drinks in the resteraunt whilst open or the cafe but the only bar to sit and chill and drink was called the cosy bar and that's open 2200 to midnight but on each occasion we went in it was never staffed, we were expected to get the staff from the resteraunt bar to come up stairs to serve us. The staff were great in the resteraunt , friendly and we noticed after giving tips to some of the helpful ones, others were going  out of their way to serve us. We noticed whilst there that we were the only ones all inclusive, even in the evening the place to sit out was Tuna Turner but even though this was part of the hotel you had to pay for drinks here. The towels for the pool were very thin and needed replacing, we were told if we lost our towel cards, first time is was 3,000 Rupees and 2nd time would be 7,000 (around £17). The location is great and with a beautiful beach. No entertainment in the evenings other than on the first night a dj set at Tuna Turner, every other night there were musicians playing whilst you're eating in the reteraunt.","Location good, but needs a little tlc","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r1004480240-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The good bits:
Rooms have a good layout and are conveniently located for the sun beds which are directly in front of your room. The hotel is only a few steps away from the beach. 
The hotel has a boutique feel to it with a simple decor and rustic charm. 
It is ideally located next to restaurants on the other side of the train track.
The not so good bits:
The room looked tired in places and required some updating. 
Pools towels and the sun bed cushions are not in the greatest condition with frayed edges and stains.
Service is slow and staff do not appear to be as courteous or as friendly as other hotels we have stayed during our time in Sri Lanka or other areas of Asia.
Breakfast tables are not relayed in a timely manner and the replenishment of hot water and coffee can be very slow.
We returned to our room one day to find our room door hadn’t been closed properly by the cleaner.
We also had to complain about the fluctuation of the shower water temperature which went from scalding hot to cold. 
There is no full length wardrobe and so it is only for purpose for shirts and tops. Items like dresses and trousers had draped o er the sofa or hung on the edge of the wardrobe.

The pool staff are excellent, but struggle with dirty and old sunbeds of which there are nowhere near enough. On most days the beds had all been reserved by 8am.

Tuna Turner is in a great spot beside the beach but on a couple of occasions was ruined by excessively loud music and beach parties organised by the hotel. Great if that's your thing but no getting away from it if not!

It is NOT worth upgrading board to all inclusive, there are just too many restrictions.","Value","2","Rooms","4","Location","4","Cleanliness","3","Service","4","Sleep Quality","4",,,"Our expectations for our stay here were partly based on the description of the property on the Tui website and partly our experience of similarly marketed 4-5* hotels we have previously booked in Greece, Thailand, Canary Islands and Egypt, all on an all-inclusive board basis.
First impression on arrival was very positive, with the driveway and entrance understated and tidy, with attractive water features and well maintained exterior. The feel is low-key and relaxed rather than attempting grandeur and extravagance. This feel extends into the lobby, which is simple and comfortable as a reception area and the staff were very friendly and welcoming.
Unfortunately it was at this point, whilst checking in, that the limitations of our ‘all-inclusive’ package started to become apparent (more on this).
The route to the rooms is rather awkward, either up or down steps from the lobby to corridors along the back of the accommodation wings. The first floor route through the ‘north’ wing also requires negotiating sets of heavy (presumably soundproof) narrow double doors taking you through the rather random feeling ‘Karaoke Lounge’ which was unused all week. The ground floor route to upper rooms passes through a small café area.
This brought us to our room; we had paid a supplement to upgrade to a Deluxe room, which was spacious, attractive and well furnished. In direct comparison to the five hotels we had stayed in over the previous 7 nights, the bed certainly rated as one of the most comfortable. It was also arranged to face towards the windows, which was nice. The balcony had two cushioned sunloungers and enjoys views out over the pool serving the swim-up rooms, to the beach and sea beyond. All first floor rooms have good sea views, with ground floor rooms also all facing seawards. Storage is somewhat limited with a wardrobe for hanging clothing but only a set of narrow shelves (approx. 7-8 inches deep) adjacent to this on which to place anything else.
The bathroom was also plenty big enough for our needs, with a basin recessed in a large vanity unit complemented by a fully mirrored wall. The shower was very generously sized and included a ‘rainforest’ shower head, unfortunately the heat/pressure was intermittent to begin with and following assessment by the maintenance team, only the pressure was resolved, leaving us rarely being able to enjoy anything more than a warm shower. This has been highlighted in other reviews so is clearly an ongoing issue. The cleanliness level, on arrival, was also below what could reasonably be expected but this was resolved by the housekeeping team and kept to a good standard for the remainder of the week.
Food
The restaurant was a pleasant environment in which to dine, with tables seating up to 4 persons along the glass frontage. Outside there is a decking terrace with views of the beach across the lawn and tables are set when the weather allows. Evening meals consist of a buffet of both local, Indian and international cuisine although the variety was good over the course of the week, choices each evening were more limited but still plentiful. The chef station prepares ‘to order’ dishes of the day both at breakfast and dinner. Again, there are plenty of hot and cold options, cereals, breads and pastries at the breakfast buffet.
Due to low occupancy, provision of a lunchtime buffet is uneconomical for the hotel, so a la carte dining was the only option outside of the busier weekends. This was a bit of a surprise when we first arrived, wanting only a light snack and being presented with a 4-course menu. We had already experienced the disappointment of being told wine was not included with our all-inclusive upgrade, so we were unable to enjoy a much anticipated glass of chilled white with our lunch to begin our holiday. Wine by the bottle is available at extra cost and the management were kind enough to waive the cost of our first bottle after we raised the issue of the limited value of our wrist-band.
The seafood restaurant is not available as part of the all-inclusive package, guests are able to eat here at additional cost. When we asked for bottled water at the adjoining bar we were told we would also be charged for these and it transpired that drinks from this, the only outdoor pool/beach bar, are also not included in the ‘all-inclusive’ package. There is a small café with a terrace at the end of the main pool (which at over 50m is great for swimming lengths!) and this serves tea, coffee, beer and soft drinks. Be warned though, local black coffee is included in the all-inclusive package; lattes, cappuccinos, Americanos etc are not! The morning & afternoon snacks promised in the marketing material were never available, the cabinet in the café remaining conspicuously empty for the entire week of our stay.
Pool area
Poolside time was spent at the long pool which runs along the front of the ‘swim-up’ rooms and looks out past trees onto the beach. There are the usual loungers and parasols, though both the loungers and the cushions are looking a bit tired, they serve a purpose and are comfortable enough. The pool staff did a good job of finding us a spot, bringing cushions and setting up our furniture and were always friendly and polite. Don’t, though, expect attentive poolside service which you might typically receive at a similarly rated hotel elsewhere (the 4* Khao Lak Merlin in Thailand comes to mind) bringing cocktails to your sunspot. Mainly because, you guessed it, cocktails are not included in the all-inclusive package. Drinks are available from the adjacent café, but the selection is limited.
The pool at the other end of the property is much smaller and great for a dip, but the area surrounding appears a bit haphazard with a beach volleyball court, a handful of loungers and a firepit all thrown together with some other features next to the beach bar.
Local area
The beach running along the front of the hotel is easily accessed, beautiful golden sands with some lovely spots to walk to, including a temple amongst the trees on the headland to the north. There is private surf board hire and tuition at several locations along the beach, make the most of the cheap deals if the surf is looking good! The tide rises quite high at certain times so there are no beach lounging facilities provided by the hotel, though several frames were being temporarily erected to accomodate some form of seating/lying area. Presumably these were to be ready for the peak season.
There is a railway station immediately outside the hotel entrance with a fairly regular service to Ahungalla, Hikkaduwa, Galle and beyond to Matala southbound, Colombo to the north. The diesel locomotives trains are loud and services start early so worth noting if you are a light sleeper, though we were never really bothered by this. The town of Aluthgama is a short walk away with market stalls, spice shops and supermarkets.
In summary, a comfortable enough stay, with friendly and enthusiastic service but sadly fails to meet expectations in delivering a genuine 4* experience. TUI are probably nearer the mark in awarding this hotel a ‘3T’ rating, but still sell it on services it doesn’t appear able to provide. A bit of investment by the owners of Ekho hotels in the infrastructure and facilities could improve this greatly and this is evident from a similar experience staying at another of their properties, Ekho Safari, only days earlier. The generous Tripadvisor rating appears heavily influenced by guests from the region staying weekends with family groups who may have very different expectations to the seasoned international traveller looking to book an everything-taken-care-of hassle-free package holiday.","Great location, overall experience disappointing","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r981461235-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Also breakfast and meal times a chaos. Half the time there were not enough crockery or cutlery. Soup often ran out and the juices were watered down and tasteless.

In the lunch menu, there were no vegetarian mains mentioned and my sister ended up having the same meal she had the night before and what was later recommended by staff to myself was of poor quality. For breakfast we had to suggest what they could make for vegetarians as they weren't sure what to offer.

We were a larger group, occupying four of the six rooms. Check-in was a long process and no one seemed to want to tell us what was taking so long. Staff were very helpful in taking bags up to our rooms.  Rooms were spacious, beds quite large, views were really beautiful and the bathroom décor was very impressive, but the cleaniness needs to be questioned. I don't believe the linen was dirty, but the stains on the bedding, the curtains, the furniture really was disgusting. The towels are in desperate need of an upgrade. When the towels are fraying, it's clear they need to be replaced. We were shocked to find out that alcohol is not served...a little disappointed at not being able to enjoy a cocktail by the pool. But BY is not a problem. They were able to provide glassware, bottle openers and ice buckets when asked. Need to advise guests of the requirement of giving plenty of notice to the kitchen if you wish to have dinner, or order a Sri-Lankan breakfast. We waited for two hours for dinner....with two hungry children in tow! And then a childs order was wrong. No apology from the chef, no offer to correct the order...very frustrating. The meals were okay, but after the food we had experienced during our two weeks in SL the food here was a let down. The location is good. The beach was very rough due to monsoon season, so care must be taken if you plan on playing in the waves. A special thank you to the staff who organized the Australian Network channel for us, we really appreciated the efforts and to the staff who rose early to help us with our departure and packed breakfast for us, that too was really appreciated by all members of our group.","Not as we expected...disappointing","2014-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r208455856-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly let me thank you again for the positive comments you have made with regard to the hotel. Corrective action will taken where necessary. 
With regard to the price ... Were you aware at the time of checking in the price you were paying for the room?  If not please let me know.

We are a 6 room boutique hotel. Which means we have most of the facilities of a 5 star and additional privacy and personalised service. We have a total of 16 staff,( professional ) well equipped kitchen, full sized swimming pool , luxury large rooms , satellite TV, unlimited Wi-Fi , the hotel is well maintained with high cleanliness & hygienic standards, 24 hr security etc. Unfortunately all our fixed costs need to be recovered with just 6 rooms. Hence the rates that we need  to charge to operate effectively. It is not unusual to find this kind of rates being charged by boutique hotels in all parts of the globe. 
On the contrary Most of the larger hotels can afford to offer better rates and it is a well known fact.
We are sorry that we have not been able to fall in line with your price expectations!

May I first thank you for your review even though it is very disturbing to have received such a shocking one! after getting used to glowing tributes by most of our guests this came in like a thunder bolt out of the blues. My first reaction was... could this be from a competitor. However given the benefit of the doubt & probably thinking that it had been the WORST DAY at Roman Beach I would like to clarify as follows
We have 16 staff members for a 6 roomed boutique hotel. We do not serve buffet meals as expected by some guests. yes we do have a limited choice in our A' la carte Menue in total about 50 varieties but we strive to maintain very high quality & Quantity standards to be amongst the best in the industry.. 
WE ARE RANKED AS # 1 IN HIKKADUWA IN TRIP ADVISOR ACCORDING TO VISITOR REVIEWS. We couldn't have got any where  close to that  if our other guests though about us the same way!

We are very sorry that we have not been able to match up to your expected high standards  however we will strive even harder so that our glowing tributes would get even better!!!

The beach right behind the hotel is not safe for swimming, one needs to walk 10 to 15 mins towards your right as you enter the beach to do some swimming.
The food was ok, nothing exceptional.
The rooms are very nice and quiet big and same with the bathrooms, but we found a lot of small red ants all over the hotel (in the room, bathroom, restaurant tables and near the pool).
The service is decent but for the price you pay i was expecting far better service.

Eg,
1) The room was not ready when i reached the hotel (by around 2:30 PM). had to wait around 25 mins at the reception.
 
2) My return flight was preponed by 12 Hours which ment that i had to check out a day in advance than what i had booked for and requested the onsite manager if this could be done, he could not help me and asked me to talk to their booking manager who was not available on site, the least i expected was the hotel to connect the right person over phone either from the reception or patch the call to the room. Eventually my airlines put me on the next days flight and i didnt have to check out earlier.

3) I had asked for a mosquito coil to be provided in the balcony as there were lots of mosquitos,    room boy first came with an electric repellent, the balcony does not have a power socket, i sent him back to get the mosquito coil and he didnt come back for the next 20 mins, i had to call the reception again as they had forgotten about it and they finally sent it to my room after almost 30 mins after my first call. 

Having said that, this is a nice hotel, they brought a cake to the restaurant on our wedding anniversary and all the staff were there to greet us.","Decent Little Boutique Hotel but Expensive for what it is.","2013-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r153026769-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

(For example, following me back to my room from the pool area to present me with a bill for a bottle of water they had forgotten to add to the previous night's dinner bill. I'll pay it when I check out thank you!)

I think for me personally, Roman Beach is an impressive building in a not-particularly-impressive location; Hikkaduwa isn't a very smart place and Roman Beach would be more at home in Miami. I felt the garden area was a bit too small and I ended up wanting a bigger and more relaxed hotel.

That said, the room was good, the bathroom impressive, the seafood good.

The beach area was spotless and well looked after by a beach guard. The beach is a private cove with views over to Galle.  It's great for swimming but there's no ability to go for long walks along the beach. The pool is salt water and runs alongside the hotel. Gets lots of shade which probably is a plus point in the heat!

The staff were very chatty, attentive and friendly. 

Food was of a high quality. Lots of choice for breakfast and lunch. However, the evening meal was very restrictive with a set menu offering limited choice. The vegetarian menu didn't seem to change from day to day. We found this very frustrating. 

Really easy to visit Unwatuna or Galle from here. Tuk Tuks wait at the end of the lane and cost c 1,000R to get into Galle for example. 

Perhaps our personal preferences weren't suited to CocoBay - limited evening meals, everything centered around a small cove.

The waiter constantly comes to the table and takes your plate before you have finished eating. So rude! They don’t allow you to pour your own milk in your tea or coffee so it does not taste right. They need to serve the food and pick up the plates after the guest leaves the table. The waitstaff is too overbearing. Also, there are dogs in the resort.

The location works very well for the stay.

Fantastic bathroom, had a jacuzzi na dwe were offered handmade soaps at check in.
The room had a great view of the the ocean in front of it and the accessibility of the beach is another major plus.
Staff are courteous and nice in general.

CONS:
Decor is subjective, but we felt that the decor is overdone/weird/mix of way too many things.
The pricing of the property at almost INR 10,000 (USD 120) per night, doesn't meet the expectation standards, there are a lot of options to choose from around the area.
At the price charged per night, you'd expect a buffet breakfast. Unfortunately, an extremely limited breakfast set menu is on offer, which is not adequate as a breakfast, leave alone for a star hotel breakfast.
With the checkout time at 12:00 p.m., the front desk called us at 12:25 p.m. and informed that a full day charge would be levied if we stayed beyond 12:30 p.m. Basically they shoo'd us away. Didn't expect that from a hotel on a Monday when all the guests are checking out and barely any new customers are walking in.
The front desk lady was rude in general, not just this incident.","Look elsewhere!","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3386434-r912198170-CoCoBay_Unawatuna-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Ok..good things first...the front office staff was very friendly and helpful...the room was great, spacious and had all the facilities you expect in a star class hotel including a good modern spacious bathroom. It was very close to the beach and the veiw was fantastic. We had a jacuzzi in the balcony. It was an old one with some taps not working..but passable for a short stay. The AC was put on only after we arrived and it took good two or three hours for the room to be properly cooled. The welcome drink and the fruit platter were delayed and we only received them after we came to the room after a request by us. There was no buffet so we had to go for set menues. The selections available were poor and lacked variation. There were not many vegetarian options for my wife and they were not flexible either. Kids also didnt have much to eat. However the restaurant staff was nice and friendly. I would suggest to skip set menues and go for alacarte, though it will be far highly priced than expected for the hotel class. The taste was ok..but its just like normal food you eat daily..nothing exceptional. As a result we had to change our full board to HB and eat our lunch outside. Pool was clean but very small..and the baby pool was just few feet wide and far too small. Both got very cogested even with an average crowd. The baby pool was not safe either as the deep part was right around it and a parent always had to keep an eye. So nothing much to relax there. However the pool guy was very helpful and watchful. The small private beach was clean and had a good view over the bay. Its safe for a sea bath too. So if you are going..go for alacarte and dont expect a good pool experience.

We spent a lot of time researching resorts on the southwestern coastline and were willing to pay a ‘premium’ for that extra special experience. So after investing what we considered a lot of money into our stay, we clearly had much reason to be hopeful.
So starting with some of the positives... Clearly, the position of the hotel on the beach front is great and the private beach is well maintained. However, don’t look too far in either direction or you’ll be gazing over building works or run down areas. Views of uninterrupted Sri Lankan waterfronts they are not!
We ate most meals at the hotel which ranged from pretty good to decidedly average. The breakfast menu, while quite extensive, is really not up to scratch and needs to be refined. One interesting meal proved to be the deep fried seafood which unbeknown to us, half contained fried empty prawn shells.
One serious plus point I would like to add at this stage is that the hotel staff were all fabulous and could not have done more to help us during our stay. The service was great and they were all very friendly and helpful.

I think my real reason for reviewing and the advice it brings, needs to be centred around the outdated feel of the resort and the lack of creature comforts. Visually it does need some serious modernisation. It has a feel of a throw back holiday resort rather than a piece of luxury, as we had believed it would be. The awards on the wall indicate a top 25 Sri Lankan retreat but it was one of the most disappointing places we stayed.
The towels were very old and of poor quality, the sun loungers were faded, tatty and needed replacing. The tv was a health hazard and after much crackling, we decided it was safer just to pull the plug out if the wall.
I think it was fair to say that we were much younger than most other couples staying and I’m sure that many would enjoy the older feel, but I believe if Coco Bay wants to attract a future market of holiday goers, it would be well advised to move with the times.

Due to very unfortunate circumstances, we had missed our flight to Sri Lanka and it threw our schedule off by 1 day. However, determined to stick to the plan and not let the airport staff in Jeddah Saudi Arabia ruin our anniversary, we still made it to the hotel by 330am.

The Pros:

Customer service: The management was prompt in replying e-mails and were more than willing to entertain our late check-in request. 

2) Room: The room (Privilege Suite with Sea View) was spacious, clean, and the bathroom was just nice (the staff that checked us in also provided us with a selection of homemade soap bars, which we thought was neat). The balcony had a jacuzzi overlooking the bar and the beach.

4) Going the extra mile: I had requested the hotel to make some complimentary arrangements for our anniversary and they did. The bed was decorated with fresh leaves and flowers, and we also received light refreshments in the form of fresh fruit platters, salads, sandwiches and a small vanilla cake with an anniversary wish.

The Cons:

1) View from room: Unfortunately the hotel was not facing the sunrise so we missed a timelapse-video-worthy moment, however, you may get to witness the sunset (do check other reviews to confirm this). 

2) Value for money: When it comes to what you get for what you pay, Cocobay is overpriced. For more than USD500 (inclusive of all extra taxes and fees) a night, you should be expecting a maldives-esque view with pristine waters or something close to it. If we were to grade the beach and sea itself, it would merely get a 2.5/5.","Decent hotel, but overpriced","2017-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3386434-r472016641-CoCoBay_Unawatuna-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This could be a really nice hotel and it has some qualities, but a lot of aspects are also a little disappointing. 

The hotel is quite close to the airport (about 10 minutes drive) and has a bit of a resorty feel with nice greenery and a good pool. The rooms are clean but fairly basic - comfortable bed, shower room, fairly basic amenities (no bathrobe or slippers but soap, shampoo etc). 

The hotel shows a lot of wear and tear. On both my visits, the corridor by the room (transit passengers seem to be only given first floor rooms) had a really unpleasant smell of sick.

Restaurant quality has gone down since my earlier visits. Breakfast was fine, dinner ok, lunch not very good. As noted earlier, swimming pool is nice on the other hand. 

Finally, the biggest disappointment perhaps is that I didn't find staff very pleasant, especially reception. They just seemed bored and uninterested, took over 20 minutes for them to process the check in both times, and one of my two stays, the staff tried to charge me for a bar consumption I hadn't made. It took ages to resolve this and staff kept insisting on making me pay for this until a manager checked and found that most obviously, the signature on the bill had absolutely nothing in common with mine. 

Fine for an overnight transit and again the bed is comfortable which is good, but not quite as nice as it could be.","OK but a little disappointing","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736162-d304699-r1006183213-Vivanta_Colombo_Airport_Garden-Seeduwa_Western_Province.html",

The buffet is underwhelming, so consider dining elsewhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed one night at Vivanta Colombo before flying to the Maldives the next day. It serves its purpose as an airport hotel, but don’t expect luxury.

While the drive up to the hotel is beautiful, with palm trees and fountains, the service upon arrival was underwhelming—no staff came out to help with our luggage, so our driver had to go inside to find assistance.

On the positive side, our room was very spacious, almost like a small apartment, with a kitchen, two bathrooms, and plenty of space (almost too much, haha!). The welcome fruit and cake platter was a highlight for our kids (5 and 7 years old).

However, the restaurant was a letdown. The buffet was uninspiring, small, and forgettable—we’ve had much better at other 4-star hotels in Sri Lanka. It felt temporary, just like the hotel itself, and that’s a shame because if the food had been better, we might have considered staying here again in a similar situation. The restaurant furniture was just as dull as the food, and the long walk to find the restaurant made it even less appealing.

The biggest issue was sleep quality—or lack thereof. While we expected some noise from airplanes, what really kept us up were the barking dogs throughout the night and the mosque next door, with morning prayers at 5:00 AM. With no proper soundproofing, this made for a very restless night, which isn’t ideal when you have an early flight.

Overall, this was the most underwhelming 4-star hotel we stayed at during our two-week trip in Sri Lanka. It feels old and tired, but if you need a place close to the airport with easy transport, it does the job.

Greetings from Vivanta Colombo, Airport Garden! 

At the outset, I wish to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We have noted your comment on the pricing and the buffet offerings. Our buffet spread is well balanced with a choice of Indian, Sri Lankan, Oriental & other regional cuisines bearing in mind the discerning clientele we cater to. We are disappointed that we failed to impress you with our buffet this time around. Our chefs work with great commitment to match the palate of our guests and our menus change every day. I hope you will give us another opportunity to display our strengths through which we have gathered multiple guest accolades in the past.

 
On the pricing, LKR 11700 for two pax is carefully done after a market survey of competition, raw material costs, the spread & other key factors. Also, I wish to highlight that 1/3rd of the price comprises of taxes & service charges; however, we are happy to review the pricing once again. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused and we sincerely hope that we will be able to turn around your experience on your next visit. 

Warm Regards,
Kiran Bussari

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While I wish you had a better experience, we failed to impress you this time around. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused during your interaction with our colleague at the front desk. The hotel has outsourced the travel desk operations to a professional transport provider, which is a direct cost to the hotel. At the point of making your reservation, transport did not form part of the package, however, we understand there’s always a better way to express it. Please be rest assured that your comments are taken with utmost seriousness & corrective actions will be taken to avoid future recurrence. We also note your feedback on the breakfast, and we would love to hear from you on your choices that we could include during the next menu change.

We understand you have many choices when it gets hotels, but we express our intent to remain your hotel choice for all your future travel. We recommend you avail the benefit of booking in advance and also join our loyalty program for the best rate guaranteed.

Appreciate your continuous patronage, and we sincerely look forward to another opportunity welcoming you back soon.

To start with the negative.
My girlfriend fell through the swimming pool plastic barrier and got bruised up. Sprained her foot too, so now she looks beaten up and mowed awkwardly. Really bad HMS there …
Also we found few outdoor sittings with sun. The one we did was with the pool, but people was smoking there and their smoke drifted toward us 🤢. Also my sunset a DJ started blasting music for absolutely no one, really killed the mood and it was impossible to enjoy a quiet time reading a book. We were told we would get 15% off food since we were guest. But we did not get that discount when we ate dinner, and the reason was that we had checked out. If I new that it mattered if I ate prior of latter to checking out I would of course have done it in the appropriate order. Frustrating!! Breakfast was cleaned too fast! We got pored a nice cup of tea. Took two soups and decided to get some more food. When we got back everything (tea, plates cutlery) was cleaned away. That was a real waste. Writes too as we had a purse on the chair so table was clearly “in use”

To the upside:
All staff was really nice (sync as Suduari, Thomas and Chaya). Room was awesome and the food was great. Nice swimming pool. Staff gave us fresh coconut since they were trimming a palm as we happens to walk by, serendipity!
They stores our luggage for 10 days for 20$ we really appreciated that.

Not far away from the airport what is smt good because of heavy traffic. Whenever we stayed at Taj Samudra we reached the hotel not less than one hour. My point about emphasizing that it is a branch of gateway that the hotel needs refurbishment. Furniture and styling of hotel is old. Wi-fi is very poor but it is ok either. Pillows and the bed are also can be said comfortable enough. Hotel is located in a forested area. Maybe next time when “new normal” is over, we can experience the hotel such a better way.","Not bad","2021-05","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736162-d304699-r792648446-Vivanta_Colombo_Airport_Garden-Seeduwa_Western_Province.html",

The property is situated on a massive (35 acres!) plot and is well away from the main road. It isn't easy to access or leave unless you have some form of transport booked in advance.

While being tucked away does guarantee a bit of privacy, we felt it gave a very isolated and gloomy feel to the entire property. The dim lighting in the common areas, the complicated layout and very low yellow lighting in the rooms didn't help.

We opted for a higher category of room, but sorry to say it reeked of a typical mid range airport hotel - which honestly we didn't expect from a Taj. The sofa had stains and the linen was not clean. One of the towels was torn. I shudder to think what the lower category rooms were like.

The bathroom was moderately clean but layout a bit confusing (cupboards on either side of the sink). Amenities were sparse (no shower gel provided) and were not of great quality. Luckily we had our own shower gel and shampoo. 

The staff here are wonderful though, and almost make up for the gloomy and run-down property.  Special thanks to the kind Guest Relations officer.

I didn't try the pool or gym so can't comment.

We left too early for breakfast but the staff were kind enough to pack a sandwich for us which we ate en route to the airport.

In sum, definitely not a Taj. Reminded me of the age-old Gateway properties that don't exist in India anymore. Would highly recommend that you save your hard earned money, and stay at some other more cheerful and modern hotel in the vicinity.","Amazing staff, bit of a gloomy property","2020-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3736162-d304699-r749711536-Vivanta_Colombo_Airport_Garden-Seeduwa_Western_Province.html",

Theoretically, the hotel has everything it needs to be an outstanding hotel: only a handful of rooms, very kind staff throughout, a peaceful and idyllic location, beautiful colonial vibes. We loved the manager at the breakfast who also helped out at the reception. Prices inside the hotel are also fair, and the a la carte breakfast was excellent. For thus far, the hotel could be a gem, and my review could be short and positive.

Now come the big concerns, the hotel showed some big, big no-nos to us:

- Complete mayhem with our reservation beforehand (be careful!): the hotel requires a prepayment, which is of course fine. But the hotel wanted us to pay outside of Booking.com where we reserved, that is, through an internet link they sent us. After stating several times that we would prefer having the prepayment made through Booking.com (as it is done everywhere else we ever stayed), we paid through the link not to get the reservation canceled. That actually worked, we got a confirmation from the hotel by email. At the same time, a confirmation in the Booking.com chat was not given even after repeated requests. Then it became shady: we received another message from the hotel that we should use another link to register our card (once again?) despite the prepayment. Although this link looked sketchy, like a scam, and not like the previous one. Later that day, we indeed received another message from the hotel that we should not use any such link because it was „spam“. Were they hacked and someone is sending out scam links? It was really not clear what was going on, but it certainly was a horrible start. We reported this to the hotel manager, who downplayed the issue completely, saying that it was a standard „spam“ message sent out by Booking.com, although this was clearly not the case. I recommend everyone to be extremely careful with such payment links from the hotel. 
- Questionable practices with Tuktuks: Someone at the hotel seems to fight Uber and Pick me, two common and very comfortable options for ordering a cab or Tuktuk. As there is practically nothing around the hotel, you will likely need a Tuktuk to go places. The „regular“ prices one would negotiate are actually pretty high (~1500 LKR). Uber and Pick me are much cheaper (~400-500 LKR). Yet four different drivers independently told us that the hotel security would put drivers in trouble with the local Tuktuk association that wants to implement the higher prices instead. One driver said he would get beaten if the security guard noted his plate number and two of the drivers dropped us somewhere nearby so as not to be seen by security. We reported this to the hotel manager, who then spoke to his staff and a driver. The manager told us that the hotel had no such policy and basically that nothing like that could have ever happened. Again not sure what’s going on here, but the manager‘s story appears simply not credible given the four drivers reporting the same thing who have no incentive to invent this story after all. In any case, the hotel manager does not seem to care (enough). To us, this seemed like some kind of mafia thing going on, but at the minimum such practices are unprofessional and to the disadvantage of travelers like us. 
- Last but not least, we had several cockroaches in our bathroom during our stay. Although the hotel appeared very clean overall, I guess things like that may happen in countries like Sri Lanka (but also it was our only hotel here with cockroaches). The insects seemed to come through the bathroom sewage. The hotel absolutely needs to take action. We told the manager who sent someone to remove the cockroaches, and he apologized for the inconvenience, but that’s about it. 
- The second time we had cockroaches and we let him know after checkout, he did not even react anymore. The same goes for another message about a Tuktuk driver explaining the situation above. Overall, it’s seems like the manager (who was very friendly at first), does not care too much.","Could be outstanding but then…","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8474349-d8472781-r946404597-The_Postcard_Galle-Gintota_Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

2) friendly staff- always helpful and smiling and very pro active.
3) love the anytime breakfast concept.
4) beds super comfy!!

Negatives: the rooms was paid in full and in advance but  the evening before (as I requested to settle any outstanding dues, as I head to head out to Colombo the next morning and it was an early start), I was handed an extra lkr 50,000 bill and I was told the Sri Lankan government had increased the taxes. Until that moment 
no one had informed me either in writing or otherwise about these additional charges. I got a written confirmation on the 2nd April of payment in full received and no additional charges were due. But when I check out on the 10th April, I am given an invoice of LKR 50000 + more!!
2) location is good for Galle Fort, Maritime museum but not so good for the beaches, surfing like the Ahangama beach.
3) pool rather small and jacuzzi in the room didn’t work.
4) no fridge or hair dryer in the room.

The background of the Oberoi group does no justice to the way hospitality is being practiced or conducted in The postcard hotel.

Thank you for your feedback! We're glad you enjoyed the spacious rooms and the tea factory experience. Regarding the soundproofing, the tin sheets used for partitions are part of maintaining the authentic tea factory vibe, though they can limit soundproofing.

As for the pool, its outdoor location in the mountain range makes temperature control challenging, and we appreciate your understanding of the cooler water. We're also sorry for the room configuration issue and are working to avoid such misunderstandings in the future.

We value your feedback and are grateful for your recognition of our helpful team. We hope to welcome you back soon!

With the 30% off local residents offer , you can’t expect much variation in food items. All three meals were set menu and overall very normal, cant complain too much against the cost, but could have been better.
Pool is not heated, so bit uncomfortable until you get used to the cold water. There was a field visit sort of experience where you can experience the whole tea making process.
Need to mention that the reservation and management was helpful with amendments to my booking because I’ve accidentally booked for March instead of February. However our whole stay got complicated by the false advertising about having 2 double beds in Periya Dorei Family room, because the hotel allocated a single double bed and 2 single beds, which is very disappointing as they were unable to accommodate what has been advertised.","Fair stay at Mandaram Nuwara","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g18207106-d17790720-r993967494-Tea_and_Experience_Factory_Thema_Collection-Mandaramnuwara_Central_Province.html",

The hotel and amenities were however severely lacking. There was no soundproofing at all between the rooms and you could even hear conversations happening in adjoining rooms. While they did warn us about the lack of soundproofing, the reality was much worse than we anticipated. We were woken up at 6am on both days by snoring, running children and a plethora of other noises. 

I would strongly advise against booking this hotel if you are travelling with a group as there is no common area to relax or hang out. Because of COVID, we couldn’t use the indoor bar area. On our last night we were allowed to use the indoor tea machine area however the night before that, we had to make do with sitting outside in the cold.

We stood and we stood and we stood. At no time did we notice senior staff calming things down, instead there were older men in different coloured shirts hovering around … the other annoying piece was that there were a number of folks not standing in line, staff then continued to serve them over those of us who were in line… and we had to speak up/speak out and even then it did not change much. One check-in staff explained that there was some computer inter-face issue, so I wonder why we were all asked to check-in at the same time if you were aware of the issue. Also perhaps signage explaining there will be a delay???? It’s always about senior management, and I have been to other hotels where seniors staff are out and about making sure things are ok. 
I also wanted to add that while staff were friendly and helpful if one had a question, noticed that at the delicious breakfast there was lots of wait staff out and about, trying not to make eye-contact.

Thanks for choosing Cinnamon Red Colombo.
We appreciate your review and understand your concerns regarding the recent changes in our operational procedures. We regret any inconvenience caused by the changes, particularly the removal of an early check-in and late check-out facility.
The changes are in direct response to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority's (SLTDA) new minimum rate policy, which took effect on October 1st, 2023. According to this policy, hotels are required to adhere to a set minimum rate for their services, as well as follow certain guidelines laid by the authorities. We are seeking clarity on certain matters connected to the new guidelines, and our staff will be in touch with you once this has been obtained.
We hope this will not deter you from staying with us again.

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay, and we truly appreciate your loyalty as a returning guest. We understand your concerns about the room setup and would like to address them as follows.
You had booked a twin room, as stated in Agoda's description: ""Additional person in room adult or child can stay with an additional fee. Futon couch will be converted to a bed - L 79”X W35” X H5”. This description makes it explicit that the futon couch is intended to serve as an additional bed for an adult guest, and the dimensions have been provided as well.
We regret any confusion that may have arisen due to this misunderstanding. Our assistant front office manager promptly contacted you to discuss the situation and provide clarification.
If you find the futon couch uncomfortable, we recommend booking an extra room to better meet your preferences and ensure your comfort.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay with us. We appreciate your review. 
Firstly, we'd like to address the issue of our staff's welcoming approach. At our property, we have a unique concept where we do not escort guests to their rooms or provide room introductions. This information is provided at the point of check-in as well as printed on the keycard pouch for easy reference. We understand that this approach may differ from what you have experienced in other hotels, but it's designed to give guests the freedom to settle in at their own pace. However, we are always available to assist guests with any requests, including luggage assistance, upon their request.
In regards to the bathroom issue, we take your feedback seriously and have conducted a thorough investigation. It's reassuring to know that there were no issues before your arrival, after your departure, or during the current occupancy of the room. This suggests that the problem may have been related to the use of the flush button. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
We would like to clarify that our breakfast service follows international standards. Plates are made available on the buffet, and guests are encouraged to help themselves. We apologize if you were not aware of this.
Your feedback regarding our staff's demeanor is essential to us, and we regret if you felt our team was not as responsive as you expected. 
While we aim to provide a sophisticated and comfortable environment, we apologize if your overall experience did not meet your expectations.
Thank you for choosing our hotel, and we look forward to the possibility of serving you better in the future.
Best regards!

Colonial style hotel. There’s a nice feel here. 

The open communal lounge area inside is a nice space. Interesting books on local wildlife and tea plantation history. There are also some lovely photos of the owner and his family and some local people. 

The covered veranda dining area outside is also lovely with beautiful views across the valley and hills opposite. 

There’s a chance to chat to other guests in this environment. 

The main person on site (duty manager?) who looked after us was a lovely polite young man - I didn’t get his name. He was very attentive and had excellent English and was happy to advise on things to do. 

We took a walk to One Tree Hill - lovely views - takes about 1 hour to get there - take about 300-500 rupees per person as there is an entry fee to the site.

The walk to the waterfall in the grounds was nice - not far - but a steep short climb back up - you’ll puff a bit! 

The pool is a nice spot to relax in the sun. There’s a small slide at one end - which is fun but there’s quite a quick drop - hold your nose!! And take care as there’s a hole in the pool floor.

Unfortunately I have to make a few slightly negative comments. It feels wrong to complain about some of these things in a country where the majority of people generally have very little. But the hotel costs are quite high/getting close to western prices and if it wants to continue to do so some improvements are needed.
The general style appears to be shabby sheek if I’m polite - but it is tending more towards the shabby at the moment - the hotel does need a bit of TLC. Curtain pole fell off wall in one room. Lightbulb fell off bedside lamp in the other - exposing the electric cable. Blinds didn’t all open properly. Some ripped. Drain in floor of pool not covered leaving potentially hazardous hole. 
The food was Ok to good. Western style mostly. Sensible portions compared to some other hotels we stayed in where there was excess and waste - so that was good. But it wasn’t excellent food and it was very expensive for what it was.
The tea plantation tour I also thought was a little disappointing - I expected to walk through a larger area/go further in to the plantation. Instead we walked up the drive and along the local road (which we’d already done ourselves) We did meet some of the pickers for a short while and did get some interesting information but it wasn’t very in depth and the guide at times seemed a bit more interested in taking silly posed photos for us. 

Overall a nice stay in a very special spot. Lovely polite management staff. With a bit of investment in repairs and refurbishment, this could be an exceptional hotel.","Lovely spot.

Our first night was in the smallest room (The Bay Room) which looks out at a wall.  The room just needed some money spending as the sofa had water stains on it, the paint was peeling and the white wall and floor outside was grey and unattractive to look out on - not helped that dogs had done their business out there! 

We were moved after one night to a much nicer room - although still the windows did not shut properly and you could not lock the door (not that this was a problem for us in such a small hotel but still I mention as it may be for some).

The food is ok but the Western dishes are priced very highly.  The first night's dinner was not very nice (perhaps we just ate after other guests and our fish had been left for a long time as it was very dry and came in a pineapple sauce which seemed odd.) After the first night we asked for Sri Lankan food and the staff were super accommodating (especially lovely Vish) and the food we ate after that was very good and was offered to us at half the price of the Western food. 

The staff are lovely and we greatly appreciated their efforts taking a picnic down to the lovely waterfall for us. We also did a nice guided walk up One Tree Hill and saw much more tea than is visible around the hotel. (I mention this as the tea was a big thing for me. My husband was born on a tea estate in India and I have always wanted to go and see a tea estate, but now there is very little actually around the hotel at Asburnham and the trees have been allowed to grow so tall that the views from the hotel are limited.) 

All in all, the staff are great, very friendly and hard working, but the owner needs to spend some money on the hotel as it simply does not look like the photos.","A lovely hotel in need of some TLC","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r939016594-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

I write this review with mixed feelings as Ashburnham lodge was intended to be the culmination of our holiday in Sri Lanka - a bit of luxury before we headed home.  There are a number of reasons why I can’t give this hotel a five star review;
On arrival, after a very awkward interaction, we established that the lodge was unable to serve alcohol. They had had it all confiscated by the authorities as they are not licensed. They did send someone to purchase some alcohol for us but I feel this disclosure should have come before our arrival as we had been in contact several times. 
The rooms: While quaint and clean, our room had a lingering musty, damp smell and no air conditioning. The decor is intended to reflect that of an old english colonial home but in many respects, it is in dire need of upgrading. There are fiddly complimentary liquid soaps etc, again far from worthy of a four star rating. 
The food: dinner was good, small portions but adequate. 
Wifi: There is limited access in the rooms and unreliable access in the main dining area. It is fair to note that we were there during the Easter terror attacks so internet access could have been affected by this. 
We did the cooking course with Reggie, the chef - it was great! He is a very accomplished chef and so willing to share his knowledge. 
My son did the naturist walk with Anna which he loved. 
All in all, this accommodation felt more like a home stay, not the luxury we were expecting and certainly paying for.  I think this is where the photos and advertising is slightly misleading. 
I have since taken the time to thoroughly read through all of the reviews and suggest that if you are considering Ashburnham, you do the same. Many of the comments are quite justified - I just wish I’d taken more care to do so before choosing this hotel. I am certainly not sorry with our choice, I just wish I had been more informed. Nonetheless, the staff were exceptionally responsive and helpful and it truly is a magical location.

I get what they are trying to offer here which is a unique experience but it does need some TLC to bring it up to standard. The pool area needs attention and more seating and the bathroom needed updating plus we could only close our door if we locked it - perhaps they have plans for this? The guide Anna was lovely and very knowledgeable plus the chef here is very good so they have this part sorted. Phi and Bryony are very helpful but feel this is a bit of an extended gap year for them plus they did have friends staying so perhaps that was a bit of a distraction. We couldn't understand why the owner doesn't employ Sri Lankan hosts. This was booked as part of a tour so perhaps I should have checked for AC as this was our main problem, I accepted this hotel based on the reviews so feel I need to honest as it won't suit everyone.","Faded Grandeur","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r666563444-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, we appreciate the many lovely comments you made. However, we are shocked to hear that you felt the food to be disappointing; looking through our guestbook there is praise after praise for the food.

We serve a range of Western dishes, which you could have chosen. We are friendly, socialable hosts and are always available; therefore, if you had any problems we were here for you to raise them to and are disappointed you didn’t mention your thoughts when we could have done something to rectify it.

I was disappointed by the food. Very expensive by Sri Lankan standards ($28 for 2) and very (I never expected to say this about sri lankan food) bland!  One day we were given the same curries for lunch and dinner, one dish we really disliked and didn't eat it yet we got it again that evening. Another evening the dinner was completely cold. We were never asked if the food was ok. There is no where else to eat and the food is extra to the room price.

Being a remote place you may want to take a massage there as part of your retreat … but you should know that any massage here will cost you approx 4 to 5 times more than in any other places in Sri Lanka . … even twice the price of a luxury hotel we vis sites in Sigiriya … the cheapest 1 hour massage is approx 200 dollars … on another aspect a cocktail is 21 dollars … something you may want to be aware of before going there …. As strangely once you try to access the spa menu from their website for example it is not working . This hotel is an architecturally interesting cash machine","Architecturally interesting cash machine","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r996199692-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for the very detailed analysis and the review. We apologise for short comings you have experienced such as steam and sauna being not on or the therapist croaking. These are not certainly up to the standards we have set over 6 years. 

Unfortunately though you are referring to our responses as defensive or pointing out other reviews, that is not the case, We are just pointing out facts. While an individual review is an opinion of a personal experience and expectations and understanding,  its a fact that Santani has a FIVE star rating over 6 years and over 96% of our guests recommend us. It is the same over every rating platform from google, Expedia, Booking.com etc and we are in the top 5% of properties globally. On top of that, experts in the industry from Travel + Leisure, CNT, CNN Travel, BBC Travel, Telegraph, TIME, Forbes, How to Spend it on FT, etc etc has rated us as one of the best hotels, wellness retreats, etc in the world with Travel and Leisure listing us as the best global wellness retreat just 3 months ago and TIME listing us as one of the 100 greatest places on earth.

The above is not positioning or marketing but facts. We do not understand your intentions as you kept trying to say you were an expert in design and architecture to food to spa etc but above ratings and recognitions is the summary of over 3000 guest feedback and its not about us being defensive or giving excuses. 

You may have noticed since you have analysed other reviews as well that just few reviews below there was a couple who extended their stay within 5 minutes of arrival around the same time period you stayed. So while we absolutely respect your personal opinion, we are just responding with the overall feedback we have received from over 3000 guests over 6 years. 

We understand Santani is unique and we are not about being a product. Its not about selling a room, a meal, a spa treatment. Its about creating feelings and peace of mind. Unfortunately, anyone looking at Santani as a simple physical product will fall short. Unfortunately, your stay seems to be focused on analysing with the purpose of reviewing rather than enjoying your stay. We also noticed that you did not review any other property in Sri Lanka. Also you refer to another property to point our that its an excellent brand but spa treatments are cheaper. What you had missed is that hotel has a much lower rating than Santani in every platform but their overall rates are double that of Santani.

Santani provides driver accomm.
- depending on time of year, book for 1 night, and see if you like it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"- Summary - 

A beautiful property in a beautiful location with attentive staff, let down by an overall low price to value ratio. Santani’s marketing implies an alternative eco luxury experience for the discerning, but the product falls short of the entry price and the hotel’s ‘positioning’ ends up feeling more like an excuse for its shortcomings.

- The Details - 

We booked the Mountain View Suite for one night, with the intention to stay for three if we loved the hotel. 24 Hours in Santani gives you space to experience the product. We experienced the full board (three meals), had a 90 minute SPA treatment on day one and used the SPA facilities, did morning Yoga on day 2, and chose to relax by the pool instead of opting in for one of the other activities (a hike or walk to the river). The option to extend had been communicated to management and the availability was open, but we chose to end our stay after one night and see the rest of what Sri Lanka had to offer. A guest we spoke to indicated they wished they had chosen a similar strategy.

- Property - 

The property is in a beautiful location and it’s a mission to get to (just ask our local driver). The design is respectful of the landscape and well integrated within it. There is a special silence in the place, and you do feel as though you are occupying a part of the natural world that is occupied by few. When the wind blows you hear a soothing whistling in the trees unfamiliar for those of us who live in large cities.

The pictures are an accurate representation of what you’ll find overall. The SPA design felt a little basic and given its importance to the property did not meet expectations. I would liken the design to almost like a military barracks, with some nice touches like large  indoor/ outdoor massage spaces.

Arrival is quite special. After ascending a winding jungle road you are greeted with a beverage and checked in at a concrete pavilion away from the main property. This is also where you check out.

- Mountain View Suite -

Each suite is an independent outbuilding, this is nice and creates a sense of privacy. We opted for twin beds as we were friends sharing. However, some suites are closer then is ideal, if I was there with my partner I’d worry about noise transfer.

As pictured, the view and panorama from the suite is spectacular and really wonderful to wake up to. However, for me - this is completely let down by a critical design feature. This is a design feature also mentioned by other reviewers, and so we were aware of it before coming to the property.

To be clear, I am a lover of design and have commissioned my own architecture-led renovation projects. At ~$1000 per night, nobody, nobody can convince me that building Suites with unenclosed toilets was a good idea. You are literally defecating and urinating in the same open space as the bedroom, and there is not enough distance between the toilet and living area to ensure that bathroom ‘noise’ isn’t heard in the living space. I was here with a friend, so we rotated out of the room, which I think is ridiculous for this ticket price. If I was here with my girlfriend we would have done the same (is it romantic to listen to each other poo?). There is nothing discerning or interesting about this design choice, by objective architecture and design standards it’s bad, and just not justifiable for a hotel charging these fees.

I can’t remember if there was a turn down service, I think there was. However, having experienced other hotels in the region Santani needs to do a better job; you share the domicile with insects (the hotel is transparent about this), so in keeping with the standards set by much cheaper hotels in Sri Lanka - the bed area should be enclosed with the mosquito net as part of the turn down for when you return to your room after dinner (@santani - this is east to implement)

Other much cheaper hotels provided natural / eco Mosquito Repellent and natural / eco After Sun in the room - Santani didn’t. I’m a mosquito magnet and got mauled by mosquitos at Santani. 

- Staff - 

Are courteous, nice, personal, and balance formality and informality well. 

- SPA Treatments - 

The SPA ecosystem in Sri Lanka is very mature, and it has the best price to value ratio for treatments I’ve experienced anywhere in the world. We had amazing massages at 5 star hotels ($40 for both a 90 minute and 60 minute signature massage), and at small village outlets ($10). We always paid a fraction of what we would in Europe.

Unfortunately, Santani has elected for a different model.

The SPA treatments at Santani are the most expensive we experienced in Sri Lanka. A fellow guest brought up the subject poolside and said the same. For two massages (both 90 minutes), our bill was $400. The Aman in Galle - one of the premiere luxury hotel brands in the world - charges $125 for its signature 90 minute massage.

Our trip to Santani was very much about relaxation, and at this price point we had high expectations - they were not met.

My masseuse was croaking and clearing his throat constantly during my treatment, which for 45 minutes (until the loud rain blocked out the sound) was distracting and not commensurate with the price point. I did ask him if he needed to take a minute to clear his throat, and he politely said no, I didn’t want to press the issue for fear of being rude to him. I was also positioned in the massage bed in a way that bent my neck as if I was looking up - I didn’t realise it at the time but it killed my neck until I adjusted after the first 30 minutes. I didn’t want to complain about him to management for fear of getting him in trouble as he was a nice man (@Santani - speak to your whole team). The massage itself was good, but there was nothing phenomenal, differentiated or memorable about it to justify the premium.

The nicest element was that it was partially outdoors but covered, and the hard rain was soothing. I had not experienced that combination before. The masseuse encouraged me to come back for another massage to address some back issues we discussed and asked me the next day how my back was doing which was nice. There was absolutely no way I was going ‘back’. 

Before the massage you are encouraged to use the SPA facilitates, to steam, sauna and dip in the thermal pool. Both the Steam and Sauna had not been switched on. This is unacceptable, how hard is it to prepare the facilities for your guests at this price point? I switched both of them on myself and they didn’t start functioning before we started the treatments. They were ready for use (and functioning well) after our treatments, and also being used by other guests.

The thermal pool is really nice, and nicely designed, but nothing about it justifies the highest SPA costs we experienced in Sri Lanka.

Also one of the showers didn’t work (I think there are two). 

- Pool - 

Nice and relaxing, with incredible views and nature happening all around. Albeit small and shallow. The growth of the jungle has mostly obscured the infinity view of the long side of the pool.

- Dining - 

At check in you’re walked to the main lobby building which feels very woowoo, where you sit, take in the views, and the chef asks if you have any dietary requirements and if you want western or Sri Lankan meals (for a short stay not based around a package or goal, this is the extent of the personalised menu, and similar to other hotels in Sri Lanka).

I opted for Sri Lankan as I had and continued to do all trip. This gave me a good view of what good looked like. I’d say the food at Santani is fine compared to the standards set at properties across the country. It absolutely does feel clean, and healthy, and home made. Other reviewers think the food is amazing here, I am really into food, and I do not think it is. You can take that for what it’s worth to you :). 

As someone who is not trying to lose weight, and needs to eat to keep weight on - the portions were too small for me, so by dinner time I asked for additional portions and the team were very willing and provided them. It’s slightly uncomfortable to ask for ‘more’ in a relatively formal setting, so I think this should be offered up front given the intention of the resort is to cater for different client health needs and goals.

- Yoga - 

Morning Yoga was really excellent. It was a 90 minute session, challenging, with a phenomenal instructor who showed passion and humour. It was memorable to do the practice early in the morning, on an open polished concrete platform, with the sound of nature, and the sun breaks through the trees. I also spotted a TRX which I’d have used if I stayed longer (as there is no gym).

- Management response -

I’ve noticed the management approach on Trip Advisor tends to be quite defensive. I don’t think this is a good look for a luxury hotel and not in keeping with the standards of the industry. I’d like to advise the management to stop;

(I) pointing to other excellent customer reviews as evidence there is nothing wrong with your service

(II) implying that the issue is actually with the customer, and them not understanding your product (it’s really not that different or hard to understand) 

(III) making excuses instead of actively addressing the issues your customers raise, in order to improve the overall delivery of your product.

- Would I recommend Santani -

I’m not sure.","Does not meet expectations","2022-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r835112932-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Thanks for the positive comments on the views, room, pool, spa etc.
 
We are also sorry to hear about your experience specially on the service and food as we have have a 100% record on service and food. Even the review that came on the same day from someone who stayed the same time has confirmed that Santani gave them the best service and cuisine in whole of Sri Lanka. This has been a key focus for us and continually strive toupgrade the skills of our team and service. 
 
We have undertaken a thorough investigation of your comments and unfortunately we believe some of your negative comments are factually incorrect and genuinely questionable.
  
You had contacted us and had asked for a special rate saying you are a Travel Agent and in the process of setting up a new Travel Agency and this was a Familiarisation visit. We have made an exception (as we do not provide discounts unless its from an existing travel agent) and had given you a discounted rate that is less than half the 300 pounds you claim you paid for a view. We deal with over 200 travel agents and has hosted many an agent on familiarisation visits and no agent posts reviews on TripAdvisor as its simply unethical as an agent to do so. You are promoting multiple properties and your review can be influenced by a competing property. Agents on familiarisation visits discuss with us if there are any aspects that may not work well for their guests and we work around them and inform the potential clients about the design and why certain things are a certain way.
 
It seems you had simply lied to get a lower industry rate.
 
You say Santani is 1.5 - 2 hours away from Kandy and 4 hours from Sigiriya, which both incorrect. We are not sure where you came from or which route you took when you arrived but Kandy city center with the Temple is only 1 hr away and Sigiriya is only 2.5 hours.  
 
Also, conceptually, we believe you have not understood Santani nor has sought understanding, which is the main goal of a Familiarisation visit. In fact you have not even asked for a fact sheet. All mountain view chalets have the same breathtaking view and you don't have to be lucky if you opt for a mountain view chalet, which we have 16. We have discussed the lack of a door in the toilet many a times and it’s a conceptual element where we want any guest to be 100% comfortable with yourself and who you are with. That is when you achieve true freedom and happiness as well. Also, though there is no door, no one can see inside the toilet, which is its own cubicle. These are all parts of the overall concept of getting our guests as close as possible to nature with an architectural silence in our buildings aimed at achieving an emotional silence, which is the new luxury and an intelligent luxury. It’s not at all about paying just for a view.
 
Whilst we always welcome genuine and constructive feedback from our customers, we believe in this instance majority of the comments are factually incorrect or misrepresented.

Thank you,
Vickum

Thankfully only stayed for a couple of nights. we could have faced the bites for longer than that. The drive to and from the villa is through a number of narrow and winding roads up into the hills.

But, out of all the hotels we stayed at during our 16 days in beautiful Sri Lanka, it was the only one where we didn't feel a real sense of Sri Lankan hospitality. There was no real welcome as such when we arrived - no manager visible, although the German owner was around, but not very friendly and rather unapproachable initially. There were no welcome notes in the bedroom with information about meal times, menus, bar prices, wifi etc... we had to continually find one of the staff and ask, which made us feel uncomfortable.(we had no idea how much we were paying for drinks until we got the bill at the end of our stay) The staff themselves were all very polite, pleasant and keen to help, but to be honest they seemed a bit out of their depth at times and when things went wrong ( no red wine available to have with our evening meal - "" sorry we have no red wine in the house' - being told there was no bacon for breakfast after being offered it when our order was taken; my evening meal arriving forty minutes after my husband's) they did their best to help, and were very apologetic, but there was never any sign of a manager to deal with the issues. Also there were three dogs in residence - we are both dog lovers, but didn't really appreciate having dogs around our table as we were eating - some people would find this very off putting. There are many excellent reviews here for this hotel, and indeed many aspects of our stay were superb - but both my husband and I felt that this could be a truly top notch establishment with just a bit more effort from the owner and/or manager (whoever he or she might be).","beautiful place, but disappointing in some ways","2014-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r193879837-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

I think that the first thing to say is that it is better to count this as being a private house in which you will be a guest, rather than counting it as even a ""boutique hotel"". Once one enters that mind set it is easier to understand how things work and you are less likely to be disappointed.

Service is kind and efficient. Our food was much more representative of local foods than in other hotels that we visited on the trip.

The view down to the river was excellent and we were able to look down on a fish eagle; however, gaining the altitude to do this involves approaching via a very steep and narrow road with some big pot holes!

Our room wascomfortable and clean but the bathroom was small and not well designed. The plumbing had some complexities that could result in temperature changes, while the shower mat ineviatably got soaked and was not changed.

This was a reasonable base from which to visit Kandy and surrounding sites. We were lucky enough to be in town for a Poya night (full moon); we were able to see someof the parade from the tooth temple. A trip to see the local dances, which was not originally planned, turned out to be very worthwhile; if you are a health and safety expert - don't go!","A base near Kandy","2008-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r22133441-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The hotel looked modern and fresh on the website. In reality, it probably needs an update because the look and feel of the indoor restaurant (it often rains or is cold up here, so you're not always sitting on the lovely veranda with its views down to Kandy) is very dated; and the re-grouting that needs doing in the bathroom and the flimsy aluminium and wood structure separating the bathroom from the bedroom weren't really doing it for me.  In all honesty, while this hotel certainly isn't bad, it was the weakest of all our accommodation while in Sri Lanka. 
On the plus side, it has a nice plunge pool and small sauna, with space to sit outside; and the food for dinner and breakfast was very good - especially the breakfast. We'd had some curries in dodgy road-side restaurants that our Guide had taken us to in good faith, so our Indian style curry at Theva was delicious. The a la carte breakfast really was good and we thoroughly enjoyed it. 
If you want to experience Kandy itself then this hotel isn't in the centre of things, it is quite a way up the top of a big hill but if you're not bothered about Kandy nightlife, then the views from the restaurant are worth it.

We had significant reservations about our rooms I’m afraid. We booked two of the three ‘suites’. They were both very different and both had annoying basic design faults, strange for a new build hotel. Room 3 is dominated by a 1970’s style hot tub Bath which leaves no room for any real sitting area. It’s not a suite in normal hotel terms. The bed has no headboard and is set away from the wall behind so there’s no way you can sit up in bed. No where to hang a towel. Doors in the bathroom you have to negotiate around to get to the loo. I could go on.
Room 4 has a dog leg area with a couple of chairs where you have a window and a view otherwise it’s all an internal room. Similar ergonomic problems.

Have some in room snacks available - eg Pringles, peanuts that can be purchased from mini bar to tie you over thru to dinner

However, there are a number of issues with the hotel that impact everyone.  The first is that the rooms are tired.  Our bath relied on copious quantities of silicone grouting.  There were no bedside reading lamps in our room.  Although the beds were comfortable the furnishings were basic.  

The second issue was that the place was a little soulless partly because it was nearly empty.  We returned from dinner at 21.30 to find the restaurant and bar completely dark and locked up.  We wanted to book an alarm call but the remaining member of staff just didn't have enough English to understand,

First of all I would like to thank you for your detail review on your one night stay with us. Kindly note my comments below;
Google Earth - 1st and the last google street view shoot was done back in March 2016. Hence we have to wait google to update it as we cannot update it locally from our end.
Reception – Regarding the issue during the booking that you encountered, I would like to point out that the $50 charge is not an additional charge but to the second person per night. Had you gone ahead with the booking for a double room initially on your email we would���ve quoted the same amount of $50 per person. Also, Having an additional guest in a room will cost us in many ways such as water, amenities and linen consumption is double than a single occupancy and Air Condition burns extra electricity to cool down a room with double occupancy than a room with a single occupancy.
Bathroom – We are glad to inform you that we have already installed a shelf in shower are a to keep your shampoo, shower gel etc. this was brought to our attention by our guests however it took little time than expected as we couldn’t find the right quality before. 
Amenities including Entertainment – We have 4 movie channels, 5 Sports channels, 13 Variety channels in 6 different languages, 5 Travel / Living channels, news channels and kids channels. We have more than 25 International channels and 6 Sri Lankan TV channels. Hence we are unable to understand what you meant by ‘basic Channels’
Food Offering- We regret that we were not able to exceed your expectation. However our breakfast was a hit on many guest reviews.
Security - We would like to put on note that the hotel is under CCTV surveillance 
Value for Money – You were allocated Room no 103 one of our best Superior rooms. We fail to understand what made you to call it Inferior room.

We hope you will give us another opportunity to serve you at Yara Galle Fort.

Thank You.

Close by are shops, banks, restaurants and bars

Google Earth – The un renovated hotel can be seen on Street View

Architectural Style – Low rise characterful recently renovated Colonial building

Reception – I had experienced some difficulty with my booking.com reservation but reception had responded speedily to email enquiries prior to my arrival. However, my original booking had been for one person but due to a change in circumstances check in was to be for 2. This resulted in an additional surcharge of $50 which I considered quite expensive bearing in mind the only additional expense the hotel would have was an extra towel and a breakfast

Public Areas/Decor – In the entrance a small restaurant /bar with tables also outside on the roadside garden. Internally a garden courtyard with seating area. Décor fresh with antique objet

Guest Rooms – Several types of room advertised on booking websites. Not sure I was allocated the one I actually booked. This was adjacent to the reception area and proved to be quite noisy

Decor/Maintenance/Cleanliness – Everything was fairly new and in reasonable condition

Furnishing/Bed –king size bed with side tables, wardrobe and work top/dressing table

Bathroom – Well appointed with good quality fixtures and fittings. Walk in shower. Reasonable powerful hot water. Ample towels and complimentary toiletries. However, lacking attention to detail no shelf in shower area for soap, shampoo etc.

Space – Adequate

Amenities including Entertainment – TV with basic Channels, Wi-Fi, tea and coffee making, complimentary water, mini fridge. Plenty of electrical sockets capable of charging personal devices

Lighting – Not a lot of natural light. Bedroom faced onto the courtyard corridor and for privacy it was necessary to have the blinds closed most of the time. Artificial lighting was reasonable

Air Conditioning – Effective

Noise – Some disturbance from other guests in corridor/courtyard outside room and at reception

Food Offering – The breakfast was standard

Security – In room safe

Value for Money – The additional supplement charged for an extra guest and the fact I believed that I had been allocated an inferior room left me with the feeling that I had not received good value for money

We are truly grateful for your kind words about our team. It brings us great joy to hear that our staff – from the Guest Experience Officer to our bartenders, cooks, lifeguards, and security – contributed so positively to your stay. A special thank you for mentioning Captain Nelka, Captain Kalinga, Jogatia, and Thamsha from the pool bar. We will be sure to pass along your compliments to them – they will be delighted to know they made a meaningful impact.

We’re pleased that you appreciated our beachfront location, tropical surroundings, and distinctive architecture, as well as the overall ambiance of your room.

We also sincerely thank you for your honest and constructive observations regarding areas where we can improve. We understand your concerns about the room lighting design, the occasional presence of insects during the rainy season, and the organization of entertainment and activities. Your feedback regarding food quality and variety is also noted and will be shared with our culinary team for review.

At Heritance Ahungalla, we constantly strive to elevate the guest experience, and your insights are invaluable in helping us do so. While we are glad that you found value in our location, beach, pool, and – most importantly – our people, we also recognize the areas you feel fell short of your expectations.

We had lots of nice interactions with everyone starting from the Guest Experience Officer lady, through bartenders and cooks, finishing on life guards and security. We want to emphasize work of guys from pool bar (and probably misspell their names :) ) - captain Nelka, captain Kalinga, barman Jogatia and Thamsha. Unquestionably staff is the strongest point of that hotel.
Hotel is located next to the wonderful sand beach with tropical flora and fauna. It doesn't look like another boring hotel from Turkey, Spain or Greece. Its architecture is something refreshing and memorable.
Rooms also look very pleasant and not cheap. However the first problems appear there. It takes time to understand how light switches are organized and there is no main light source on the ceiling. Instead we got a big fan which was pointless with working air conditioning. Also if you are scared of insects better be prepared to meet some in the bathroom after rains. Hotel staff proposed us change of the room but we chose just additional insect spraying. If you want to go to tropics, expect tropical animals. :)
Huge disadvantage of this hotel is lack of any activities. Live band performances were the only thing happening there. We saw an animator maybe once when they were flying kites with kids. The animation plan in the hallway had nothing to do with reality. If you want to only sunbath, swim and chill it could be the advantage but it is not what is being sold here.
Food was mostly good but there was also some inedible foods. South Asian cuisine itself is very tasty and you will be able to experience that here. However some pork was impossible to bite and chicken almost always contained little bones which can make you choke to death.
Overall this hotel is nice but it is not a five star experience. It was just like an average three star hotel in Europe but located in more exotic location. Friendly staff is the biggest jewel in its crown. Next are beautiful beach and big main pool. Beside these three things Heritance Ahungalla doesn't offer anything memorable.

In the end it is important to mention locals selling trips and clothes next to the hotel. You will always encounter them when going to the beach or even walking next to the fence. They are very friendly but remember that every interaction is meant to sell you more stuff with relatively high price. But if you negotiate prices and stay assertive, you can have a great experience for relatively low cost.","The best average hotel","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r1007687540-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It has two pools , one of which is much quieter than the other and where you can sit and enjoy the tranquility.  The wooden sun beds are showing a lot of wear and tear and would benefit from being replaced. 
However whilst the hotel is supposedly five star , it is definitely not a five star hotel. The entrance area is very nice but elsewhere the whole place would benefit from repainting  as there are a lot of scuffs and marks on the walls/floors upstairs. In our room the curtains had a lot of marks on them - the screens were broken and the bathroom had lots of marks on the walls and tiles. The tea and coffee in the room only offered English breakfast tea and caffeinated coffee. Decaf was not available anywhere in the hotel and only offering one type of tea where it’s grown we thought quite strange. The air conditioning in the room was very good. The plug sockets in the room looked dangerous and were hanging out of the wall but one plug was an international socket which was really helpful. The staff are mostly very nice and friendly, not so much the male waiting staff in the bar and restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant , the food offered was quite repetitive and in our opinion the quality of the meat in the dishes was not the best. The desserts were ok ! 
However , the one shining star of this hotel is Jayaru - the guest relations executive - she was absolutely delightful, a huge help with everything. We definitely could not have managed all the things we wanted to do without her. She arranged a private driver (Sampath) for us to take us to the elephant orphanage, Kandy and to a very interesting tea plantation at Pitigala. It was certainly a much nicer way to see these sights than with a dedicated tour bus ( the buses become quite uncomfortable after several hours of driving). Also it was cheaper to do it this way too.

They are accurate.","Value","3","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","3","Sleep Quality","3",,,"Heritage Hotel Ahungalla.  A hotel that presents itself as 5 stars, but unfortunately, after my experience there, I can barely give it 3 stars.  The location is wonderful, green in abundance and the animals and birds are in their natural habitat. It sounds like it was a dream vacation. Unfortunately it wasn't. There are people on staff who do the right thing because they have to.  Then there are the staff people who do what they do for the tip.  And there are dedicated people who do everything in their power to make you feel welcome.  The room was fine although the furniture is old. The shower door was moldy and one of the hinges was almost out of the wall. And yet thanks to ROMESH, the guy who cleaned every day, I got over how the room looked.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart ROMESH, for your dedication and for all the animals made daily from towels but especially for the flowers you brought me and thus made the room look welcoming.  Let's talk about food.  I knew that we were going to Asia and that the food was very hot and spicy there. It would be fine as long as those dishes were marked as spicy. They only marked the dishes that contained chili as spicy. The vegetables were al dente to raw, the pasta was almost uncooked, and the other types of stews were swimming in oil.  When i asked the person who was serving there about correct etiquette, he replied that it was just a little spicy ,not understanding that due to a health problem I am not allowed to eat spicy at all. Thanks to miss JAYARU, who got in touch with the head chef Mr. HISHAM, I had something to eat for the rest of the stay.  About these two people, miss JAYARU and Mr. Chef HISHAM, I can say that they are the 5 star people in this hotel.  Thank you for putting up with my complaints, showing me understanding and I apologize for all the trouble I gave you. I would like to congratulate the head pastry chef NUWAN for the best bread and delicious sweets.   As for the main bar staff, some move faster, others only if they get a tip.  So thank you for all the drinks you served me: SHANIKA, KAWESHA, RAAWESHA, THARUSHA, THULITHA. The bar at the 2nd pool at the back, the one at the rooms, was always closed with no one there.  If you wanted something to drink, you had to go to the front, to the big bar, so you had to walk 3 minutes for a drink.  Several times VISAL came and stayed there, bringing us drinks from the other bar. Thank you VISAL for all the trips made. Another dissatisfaction was the lack of an animation team.  There was a boy who did aqua gymnastics in the morning and a boy who held the yoga sessions.  And that's about it.  The evenings were very boring although there was live music every night.  The problem with these singers was that they all had the same playlist.  Old music from the 70s-80s.  So boring as hell.   Since it was not possible to swim in the ocean, we had to stay at the pool.  The cleaning of the pool was done daily, but it was done perfectly by only one employee named CHATURANGA.  The rest were doing a salvage job, even leaving dead crabs on the bottom of the pool.  The sunbeds were old, many of them in a pitiful state, the screws from the wheels were coming out and if you weren't careful you could scratch yourself in the nails used to repair them. Another problem was the lack of sun umbrellas.  Indeed there were plenty of shade trees, but there were also places where shade was needed.  I can't believe that a 5-star hotel, as this hotel presents itself, has only 7 sun umbrellas that were moved depending on who came and occupied the first place.   So..... as far as I'm concerned I spent a disappointing holiday in a 5 star hotel.","5 star once, 3 star now Too bad.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r995144676-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The rooms are equipped with TV, refrigerator, air conditioning, a kettle, old but all functional and clean.
Unfortunately the service is slow and the A.I. system is strangely designed, for each order you are presented with an invoice, in which you have to note the room and sign for it. 
We are not big drinkers of alcohol, we only consumed water and beer, sometimes mocktails.

At this hotel there is nothing related to local culture, no activities, only live music, pretty much all local artists use approximately the same playlist, what you heard last week you will hear next week.
Animation team is composed from only two employees, one is in charge of Yoga, the second one is in charge of volleyball, water gymnastics and other activities.
There is no bingo night, or even the slightest effort to involve tourists in any activity, sometimes boredom just watching a wall dry paint on it is more fun.

The food is repetitive but you can find what to eat, the only problem is that the A.I. restaurant labels are not properly displayed.
Try to find a system that will be efficient, it's a pity about all the prepared food, labor and energy.

The bread is very good (the best bread I've ever eaten in my life), the desserts and fruits, everything else is personal, whether you like it spicy or not.

Potatoes with pepper? Why? At every table you have pepper and salt. Raw chicken served raw in a restaurant because it didn't sit in the oven long enough? Sometimes the potatoes and vegetables were uncooked, leave them 2-3 min more, at least try it...

I know that in Sri Lanka they eat spicy and very spicy food, but if it's spicy food at least put the correct sign at the A.I. restaurant, or test the food before you fill your plate, as I have seen other Russian tourists do, then seeing that the food is very spicy they quit eating, simply wasting food in the garbage for nothing.

Be careful - if the hotel is fully booked there are not enough sunbeds and umbrellas.
Some of the sunbeds needs a repair, or replacement, umbrellas are damaged.

On the day we were supposed to leave we could not have late checkout. We had to take our luggage and move it to a room next to the reception. We spent a couple more hours in the hotel after 12:00, but unfortunately there is no system, even for a fee.

Pool 2 was not cleaned every day, depends on worker and mood.

What are kids under 5 doing in pool two when they belong in pool one?

However the hotel is in need of a general refurbishment, improvement of services and entertainment programs. 

All in all it was a mediocre vacation, staff is not really customer minded, no matter if you give tips or not, some of them are working hard but you cannot have 1 people working correctly and 2 pretending to work.

Special thanks:
Chaturanga - for maintaining the 2nd pool as best as he can, working hard every shift.
Shanika - for service.
Jayaru - customer support, trying but the changes are not visible, maybe in time the management will realize it is an international hotel and act accordingly?
Nelka - poolbar.
Romesh - thanks for a clean room, flowers and towel decorations. I hope you will enjoy his services too.
Ashen - for the eggs prepared every morning.
Visal, Rawesha, Tharusha, Shudat, Jagath, Kalinga, Waruni, also the Trainees.

Sorry for this but if you have no other options, give it a chance, otherwise look elsewhere. In Europe this hotel will be ranked at 3*

*why only 3 stars for this review?
- No shows, no entertainment or involvement from the staff to involve the guests, no local traditions presented to tourists.
- Food is hit & miss, depends on personal choice.
- Poor services, also the second poolbar from the second pool was closed most of the time. You have to walk for 5 min to get a drink from the first poolbar and off course sign the bill.","Was 5 stars was a long time ago, now it's only for mass tourism.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r994623408-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It was our least favourite hotel. It looks tired in places. 
We had a spacious ground floor room with a small triangular shaped bathroom. The shower doors looked in need of a good clean. Our patio doors we discovered hadn't been locked properly so anyone could have pushed them open. In the early hours of the first morning we heard 2 distinctive taps on the patio doors which was unnerving. We didn't get up to investigate but whilst the hotel is behind gates and security at the front it seemed to me that there was nothing stopping anyone wandering in off the beach area.
This hotel is very popular with locals especially at weekends so when we arrived the hotel was packed with a large group of young men playing volleyball in the main pool. All sunbeds were taken by families sitting round chatting. As this was the only day of R & R part on our trip it was a bit concerning but by Sunday afternoon things had quietened down.
This is a very large busy hotel so breakfast was a bun fight and it took us 10-15 minutes to get served tea or coffee.
Nice outside seating area by one of the bars. 
As you are nearer Colombo you will get pestered on the beach to buy things.
The sea was too rough to swim in and there are dangerous rip tides.
There is nothing to do locally but we did visit the Victor Hasselblad Sea Turtle Research And Conservation Centre just 3 miles up the road. Well worth an hour's visit to see the wonderful work they are doing.  None of the multiple hotel staff hanging around reception had heard of it even though it is literally up the same road. But a taxi driver Googled it for us and took us there and back. 
The Hotel is off one busy road with shops and other Hotels but not in a specially pretty area.

1. Приятный персонал, готовый помочь во всех вопросах (если им дать чаевые, а они этого ждут).
2. Красивая территория со множеством животных (вараны, пальмовые белки, обезьяны)
3. Неплохие бассейны

Минусы:
1. Все номера расположенные вокруг лобби вынуждены до 11-12 вечера слушать ОЧЕНЬ громкую музыку (у нас буквально чуть ли не кровати вибрировали). Нам пришлось переселяться подальше, потому что отдохнуть было невозможно.
2. Выбор еды только кажется большим, нигде не указана острота, поэтому приходилось брать наугад. Для детей нет ничего вообще. Если у вас есть проблемы с желудком - выбрать вам будет нечего.
Фрукты по факту были только папая, ананас и пресные арбузы. На завтрак иногда бананы. 
3. Персонал в столовой очень медлительный - напитки иногда приносили уже к моменту окончания трапезы
4. Экскурсии не стоит брать у парней на пляже - они выставят вам цену в два раза больше и будут пытаться завозить вас в каждое место, где у них есть откат. Лучше выйти из отеля и договориться с тук-тукерами там.
5. Чтобы пройти к океану надо прорваться через толпу очень навязчивых местных, которые пытаются вам всучить всё подряд - под конец отдыха уже начало раздражать.

Не минус самого отеля, но поплавать в океане у вас не получится - волны и довольно мелко.
Сдачи нет ни у кого, поэтому рассчитывайте и меняйте на мелкие деньги сразу, а то тоже будете переплачивать.","Красивое место, но отель с существенными минусами","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r932476982-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Restaurant is lonely place especially action station area has lack of persons to serve customers, awaiting lengthy period to taste food. I appreciate service of lifeguard who work at main pool on 16th October 2023.
But overall, it was an enjoyable day, and we enjoyed a lot because this time we have room which have both sea and pool view. Beautifully design swimming pool is another attraction has large beach front. I Highly recommended this hotel, but you must improve your customer care and room service. Further I think it would be better if the old boat which is previously locate near the pool is restore because it is iconic attraction of the hotel.

Also - as long as you are not afraid of wild animals (monkeys, monitor lizards, insects), you will be fine. Otherwise, there are not many places to go to on the hotel premises. These animals are everywhere and I personally was terrified. Nevertheless, great opportunity to get close to wildlife!

Additionally, the air conditioning unit's controller was malfunctioning, which affected our comfort. The bathroom was notably small, particularly the shower cubicle, making it inconvenient for a comfortable bathing experience. It's worth mentioning that the absence of a hand shower in the bathroom was a drawback. Regrettably, we also found that the staff did not display the same level of friendliness towards locals.

The food is lovely, and the staff are brilliant - always there to support. The breakfast and dinner buffets were out of this world. The only minor improvement needed is for the lunch buffet, as it's not actually a buffet - you have to order the main meal, which can take a while. The rooms are clean and well kept, but they do look tired. Don't forget to bring your plug adapters. The only quirk is that without the Venetian blind, there's visibility into the toilet and bathroom, so it's more suitable for partners.

What might need improving, room facilities, the bathroom/toilet.

My friends and I arrived at the hotel after a long day, expecting the welcome they advertise. But we were greeted with nothing and yet I noticed the foreign tour group next to us at the hotel were getting a great welcome. The foreign guests were given a welcome drink in front of me and even when j was checking in, nothing was really done. This was extremely disappointing to see as their attention was on the foreign guests, even though the hotels are kept afloat by locals even in times of crisis. In a sense, it felt as if I and my friends were purposefully ignored at the welcome to focus on white people. Next, the rooms were OK and clean with the needed amenities. The pool was ok and the environment was relaxing and calm. But the Jacuzzis are broken and one was unusable. This really dampened the experience. Thirdly, the buffet. The food experience was TERRIBLE. I stayed ful board for 2 days and the food was the same everytime. There was not much variety and so, it was really disappointing. At one point during lunch, I found MOLD in my food!!! The same night during dinner, my friends and I ate carved roast pork and the meat was rotten. It smelled bad and when I ate a bite, it was so rotten and I had to throw it away. The breakfast buffet had some diversity and was enjoyable. The staff is nice and accommodates our wish. The bar makes a really good cocktail called the green pool. Other than that, it was a poor experience. Serving bad food to guests and ignoring local guests to focus only on foreign guests was what made me write this review. I never badly review anyplace I travel to unless its horrible, like ahungalla was. It did not serve a purpose to my business trip either. Would never visit again.

","Value","1","Rooms","2","Location","5","Cleanliness","4","Service","4","Sleep Quality","4",,,"We stayed here for five nights as a base to explore the cultural triangle. Our booking was through Booking.com and  as is common in Sri Lanka, we paid the full amount a month or so in advance. 

The hotel is reputedly one of the best in Sri Lanka, the jewel in the crown of the Aitken Spence Hotel group. Opened in 1995, it was designed to blend seamlessly into the natural environment; in this it succeeds very well.

However, the hotel is suffering from under investment and once away from the reception, bar and restaurant areas, this is very noticeable. And the room we were given also showed signs of dilapidation: very stained loo, cracked tiles on the floor and shower of the bathroom, no chrome left on the taps, a very scuffed bedroom  floor and furniture that looked as old as the hotel. 

We booked a Luxury Panoramic King bedroom at just over £200 per night incl Breakfast. The room was large with a wide balcony and an amazing view from the 7th floor of the Dambulla wing. Our King bed however was two twins pushed together with a groove down the middle (this was not what we expected or paid for), there was no safe in the room (one was installed a day later) and no physical information about the hotel anywhere in the room. We downloaded pdf files from their app but there was no pdf map of the hotel, no Beverage menu (just wine and cocktails) and no information at all about restaurant opening/closing times or which menu related to which dining area. In addition, there were no price or information at all about their main buffet dining restaurant. 

Our check-in experience was awful. We arrived just before 2pm after a very long drive. We finally were allowed to gain access to our room at 3.25pm. In the meantime we were not offered any drinks or snacks whilst we waited (why not???) so we ordered a very poor sandwich from room service for an exorbitant $15.5 excluding taxes and service charge. 

Breakfast was good although the buffet restaurant was crowded with queues for freshly prepared food and the service was hit or miss. Personally I hate buffet dining so we avoided the $24 per head (excluding taxes and service charge) and ate in their Asian restaurant which was much more personal, far less busy and the food pretty good. Imali our server there was wonderful and staff were generally good. 

Prices of food and drink are not cheap here (or indeed throughout Sri Lanka in 5* tourist hotels and restaurants). We holidayed in Japan in 2023 and found it far better value than Sri Lanka despite the fact typical Sri Lankans hotel workers earn around £2,400 pa. It made me wonder if Tourists and staff are being exploited to the benefit of shareholders...

In our first 48 hours we engaged with management on several occasions. They tried to improve our experience but after multiple conversations we just accepted our fate and tried to enjoy our stay as best we could. (Writing this last sentence is not a great advert for this hotel on which the Heritance brand has been built over 30 years and which the Aitken Spence group have subsequently expanded across the region). 

At check-out, the bill for food and drink was correct but there was no recognition of our unhappiness with our stay (why not???). However, at my request, they ended up deducting the cost of that awful sandwich.","Not luxury or 5*","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r971668767-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Sagging mattresses, greying sheets, over-bath shower that floods the floor, etc. I've been coming to Kandalama for years now - it used to be a high class, luxury hotel that was known for its food. Now it's more geared towards the mass tourism market - lots of huge coach tours, high volume / low cost food, minimal expenditures on maintenance. Lovely staff, but very young and untrained. With a bit of investment it could be good again, but for now, it'd be wise to manage your expectations.

The layout and design is very clever as the hotel blends into its surroundings. 
On our two night visit, we found the hotel staff to be courteous and polite. It is very heavily staffed and needs to be as it’s a very busy hotel. Constant arrivals and departures. 

The room outlook was spectacular and it was spacious. It was showing many signs of wear and tear though. A squeaking bed to poor decorative patching in the bathroom to a heavily marked floor + other areas that need improvement. We looked at another room and it was also showing signs of heavy wear. The room looks tired. 
The room servicing was to a very high standard though and special thanks to the housekeeper. 

For a hotel charging this money, the service needs to be more accurate and consistent. Some examples:
the menus for the hotel are viewable via a QR code in the room - you are told to scan on arrival. The menus are wrong. 
The service around the pool can be slow and inattentive. 
The standard of the evening buffet was poor  quality for vegetarians. 
It is wrong to asks guests to pack and vacate their room when the room has been paid for until the evening. Especially when confirmed at booking in time. 
The tax on alcohol is 38% in addition to the menus prices, so be aware! 

Overall we were not impressed with this hotel considering rating qualification and the price. 
The attitude of the staff is not in question. More a training requirement, some modernisation to rooms and an overall effort by all the hotel management to ensure detail is correct.","Amazing setting and deserving of a better guest experience.","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r946496317-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The hotel is quite a distance from the local sites and about a twenty minute drive down a bumpy dirt road to reach it . 
We had a so-called luxury room which was more of a three-star standard.  The hotel was built about twenty-five years ago and starting to show its age. It seemed to cater to tour bus groups.   Our luxury view was simply a bunch of trees in front of our balcony so I wouldn’t recommend paying the extra cost for that.  Since we would be arriving a few hours before the standard check in time, we decided to pay for two nights so we could have an earlier check in.  The hotel agreed to comp one breakfast since we were actually not there. 
The food at the dinner buffet is excellent but the breakfast was of a completely different standard.  
The staff literally took the plates from our table as we were actively eating.  I complained because we needed to replenish our plates, only to come back to find our table cleared.  That’s one example of several service failures we incurred during our stay.   
Upon check out, they then refused to comp the breakfast which they had already agreed upon, since we had paid for two nights but only stayed for one.   After a thirty-minute discussion, they finally agreed.  
This hotel is famous but, in our opinion,, highly overrated.   As is the case everywhere in Sri Lanka, nearly all skilled hospitality workers have left the country due to the ongoing financial crisis.  The lack of training was all too evident at this hotel.   Once was enough.","Overrated-Poor Service","2024-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r942168958-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

It is one of the most expensive in Sri Lanka (exceeded by AmanWella and AmanGalla) and I expect much out of them as a result. Alas this was not the case. 

The negatives.
- Although architecturally designed, it is practically a let down. We had two different rooms during our stay (for the why see note below), and they were both noisy (you can hear through the next room connecting door and through the room entrance door). The second night, our room was on the 6th floor, and its floor was directly above the 5th floor corridor so you can hear loudly people rolling their suitcases to and from rooms. 
- It seems there is expediency in dealing with customers;  For example, during breakfast the check was brought as we started eating the breakfast! Can't they wait till we finish our breakfast? 
- There are few if any 240V sockets available in the rooms (sockets are British style), and not a single USB outlet anywhere. There is a USB outlet on the TV but you need to have the TV on, to charge your phone. This is 2024; a USB outlet is a must for such an expensive hotel. 
- There was a smaller TV in the more expensive room (Panasonic) and a larger one in the cheaper room (Samsung). We use the TV screen to watch video film we prepare during our travels. 
- The hotel is not very flexible. We booked a night first and then another second night at a different price. Even though we suggested the hotel leave us in the same room - the lower price room with no credit expected - we had to move rooms. 

The positives.
- The hotel is architecturally designed by a well known Sri Lankan architect, Geoffrey Bawa. It is built on the side of a rock outcropping and merges with the surrounding landscape. It is composed of two wings, with the main floor is on level 5. We stayed on levels 2 and 6. We suggest you stay in the Sirigiya wing, facing the east side as it's much nicer and away from the hotel drive way and arrival/departure noise. The buffet restaurant is above the Sirigiya wing as well. 

- There are three pools, in the center(recommend as it has nice view), on the 7th floor (rock pool - very shallow) and at the end of the west wing (the biggest pool). 

- The restaurants are excellent, full of choice. The buffet (which has a seating area near the rock wall across a short walk) costs about 7100 rupees/person for lunch and 4200 rupees/person for breakfast. The a la carte restaurant on the 7th floor has a variety of courses. Soups start around 1200/person; other dishes are more expensive. It was quiet since most visitors come in packages that includes buffet. 

- There is included accommodation for the drivers; ours said he had a nice place to stay and nice food available to him. 

- As usual with Sri Lanka, the staff is very friendly. A gentleman called Dominic came and spoke to us in fluent English providing information on most things. 

All in all a nice stay; there is plenty to improve and we hope they do that soon.","Great location with improvement potential.","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r934836364-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The natural beauty of the surrounding as well as the way the whole building is built is quite a sight to behold. What immediately strikes you as walk about and are given the orientation is just how big the property is. The wings are way longer than I imagined, a truly architectural marvel. The building I believe was built ~30 years ago and I could only imagine how magnificent and ground breaking it must have been back then when brand new. They have done astoundingly well to preserve the nature around and let the nature abound in and on the hotel itself. We were in a top floor room and it is amazing when walking in the open hallways to be right at the height of the canopy. In the mornings and evenings it is quite the bird watching tour you can do for yourself just strolling the property. And the views from the lobby and the pool area deserve a special mention. You can see straight through to Sigirya behind, as well the big lake and the mountains carpeted with thick jungle. One is well advised to carry your binoculars when visiting as there is many a bird to spot here -- Brahmin kites, eagles, grey hornbills, bee-eaters, pelicans to name a few.

The shame here is that the property is a bit dated, and there are bits which really need a bit of sprucing up or at least basic maintenance. This is an open jungle hotel (of sorts) so my expectation isn't that you fumigate the corridors so there are no critters, that's fine and in fact part of the whole experience. But this is a jungle there is a load of critters, and the walls in the corridors some of them are plasters from top to bottom with bugs smashed up (presumably flying in at night), I didn't get why they don't bother just cleaning it up. Things like that don't really add any charm. The rooms as well while comfortable are probably 5 or 10years too old. The bathrooms could really do with a bit of refurbishment. Similarly the pool area, its so beautifully set but the access is all muddy and messy (when it rains). Surely it is possible to maintain an easy path to and from the pool. Not to exaggerate but I don't really want to slip in my flip flops on the way to the pool.

Lets get to the food next. This was my first stop in the Sri Lanka trip and I was very excited about all the great food I'd have. So in short, this is not the place for good food. The food was just disappointing. The snacks at the lobby bar are super average, nothing like a 5 star standard. We didn't want the buffet so we had a-la-carte the first night. What an experience. We ordered, and then waited and waited and waited for 60 minutes !! And the food, it was so average, so tasteless. It gave me 0 confidence to try the buffet of course. The next day we just has the very average pizza at the lobby and some ice cream and just skipped the meal altogether. The breakfast buffet is extensive but average, unfortunately nothing to write home about.

This could be such a super hotel as the building blocks are all there. They need some investment to spruce things up. They need to change up the kitchen and the food completely. And then what they also need is more staff and better trained waiting staff. To be clear everyone is polite and helpful as they best can be. But this is not a five star hotel level of food & service. I expect so much more! I hope the management takes note.","Great architecture, Spectacular location, Disappointing food/service","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r933738277-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The engineering is quite something nestling the Heritance against the hillside with beautiful views of lake Kandalama at the front. A wildlife paradise for all to view. Inside it is very minimalist with something to see around every corner. Sometimes it felt like we were part of a sci-fi movie. There is a book in the library describing the vision and building process. 
We were greeted warmly on arrival and ushered into the cafe for the registration. We ordered a couple of snacks (Our first 2 choices were unavailable) service was slow, arrival drinks forgotten. The chicken spring rolls were delicious getting a plate to put them on proved difficult.
Our room was the smallest of the 7 we have stayed in in Sri Lanka and as others have reviewed a little tired with poor lighting and in need of a deep clean. There was lots of dust under the waste paper basket and the curtains were stained. A few items were missing - only 1 water glass, no laundry bag which we needed, no robes or fridge. All were promptly rectified. Initially we were informed there was a charge for the fridge however this apparently is only in December phew. 

Now for the food, we're not big fans of buffets so elected for the a la carte restaurant on the 7th floor. Tastefully appointed and never busy it was our choice for 4 nights. The first night the service was very slow and we were mistakenly presented will the bill before we  had seen any food. The couple at the next table received the wrong bill and left. When my meal arrived it was cold, it was reheated but by then I had lost my appetite. The manager very kindly took it off the bill. We found all the mistakes over the next few nights quite entertaining just like an episode of Fawlty Towers. 
Breakfast is in the buffet restaurant there is a huge choice. Some of the windows have blown so you miss the beautiful view. Often staff would try and take your plate when you were still eating or stretch over you to remove something whilst you were taking a sip. Overall the food was ok but by no means the best we have tasted in Sri Lanka.
 Chamara was our favourite waiter always greeted with a smile and showed great attention to detail. We both said several times the staff "" just didn't get it"" he did. 
Better attention to detail and improved training for staff would hugely improve the Heritance experience.

When we arrived, it was dark outside. The room looked amazing, but waking up we saw a lot of flaws. The concrete outside our balcony is completely tumbling down  (even “bars” were missing —> see picture). The toilet seat is in urgent need of replacement (it looked very dirty). The room itself, one thing missing: sockets. We couldn’t charge anything, unless we unplugged the bedside lamps. There were some sockets in the middle of the bed, but we couldn’t reach them. We live in a time of multiple devices, so plugs are a necessity. 

The bar. Well, for a hotel of this standard, it felt like we were in a convention center. Zero atmosphere, just chairs in the middle of a dark room (no candles, no plants, no nothing)

The restaurants. As it’s “impossible” to leave the hotel in the evening (elephants passing the road, which is amazing!) you need to eat in 1 of the available restaurants. There are 3 options: the buffet restaurant (not our thing, very crowded), one a la carte restaurant (nobody was sitting there. It was completely empty) or the bar (very unpleasant to sit —> see picture). The prices are very high and the quality to be honest not of a high standard for the price requested.  They take advantage of you not being able to leave. We had dinner in the bar one evening; my partner got his salade 15m before I got my club sandwich (which was cold pre-made, so I don’t get why we had to wait so long). And what I found very strange: while eating we had to sign the bill.. feels very strange.

Important to mention: the staff is very welcoming and friendly.

One more remark: they were delivering fresh fruits to some rooms. Still wondering why not our superior room for which we paid a lot of money.

So in general: nice hotel in an amazing setting but in urgent need of some 2023 updates. Not a 5 star hotel for us.","Nice hotel, but in urgent need of some botox","2023-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r917543277-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Greetings from Flameback Eco Lodge!

While appreciating your kind comments about the tented lodges, food and service, we deeply regret if you were sleep deprived due to the reasons mentioned. While we do not have any resident dogs within the hotel premises, as it's a open space, I believe a stray dog would have entered the property. We always ensure to provide the utmost care and service to our resident guests and should this issue have been brought up, our staff would have taken steps to prevent same. There are community events very occasionally in the nearby village which is not within our control but we do apologize once again for any inconvenience caused to you

We thank you for staying with us

Our first impression was that the resort did not reflect the impression from the website. The proximity to the road that runs across the lake takes away the authenticity. The tents are quite simple but comfortable, food was quite good.
Power and WI FI was always cutting out. The resident dogs that live in the camp seemed to follow us around.
On our second night we were exhausted from our early morning game drive and so After dinner we returned to our tent only to find the dog sitting on our deck and we could not get it to leave. We went to bed just before 10 pm. I fell asleep and was woken by the dog growling loudly 15 minutes later. This was followed by a loud event across the lake with drumming and singing until 2 am. Coupled with the dog circling our tent howling like a wolf. We had no sleep and left feeling exhausted.

Greeting from Flameback Eco Lodge!

Thank you for choosing our hotel during your visit to the deep south of Sri Lanka! Also, for your kind review on our food, location, accommodation, service and activities. 

As with our motto of being an eco -friendly hotel and being one with nature, we try to minimise use of energy in our operations. While we have instilled eco-friendly air-conditioning and geezers which are essential to provide  comfort to our guests to meet their expectations of a luxury glamping experience , we have opted not to have televisions and fridges in the Deluxe lodges to preserve energy.

However, our Suite does come with a TV and Mini Fridge keeping the kids in mind if they wish to use this facility

We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us and look forward to having you with us in the event you visit Sri Lanka again

Greetings from Flameback Eco Lodge, Sri Lanka!

Thank you for staying with us during your visit to Sri Lanka and for the in-depth review of the property. We welcome reviews such as yours as the management and the team always strive to enhance our product and services to make Flameback the best Eco Safari Lodge in the deep south of Sri Lanka!

We found your comments very applicable and hope the below justifies your concerns;

Fans in the rooms - As you have rightfully mentioned, all our lodges are equipped with Air-conditioners (With 0% gas emission in order to minimize environmental impact) for the comfort of the guests if they wish to use the A/C as we are located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka and the whether can be very humid at times. 
But as with any glamping tent, the tent flaps can be opened up anytime to use natural ventilation and a 'fan is provided' on request from the housekeeping department(Our staff has been briefed to mention this at the check-in and apologies' if it wasn't done). However - we have addressed your concern and placed standing fans in all the rooms in order to minimize the hassle of requesting a fan. You have made a valid point and we appreciate that for the future benefit of our potential guests.

We are located in the Weerawila Bird sanctuary about 100 meters from the ella-wellawaya road and the beauty of our concept is we are located in 4 acres of lush green surroundings and while our guests do not have to travel a long way inland to get to us, once they are inside the property , they get to experience a sanctuary of it's own. We are proud to say as with our efforts to conserve nature, we are in the process of planting more trees within the sanctuary in our efforts to conserve the lake and the birding population around the area

Thank you for your wonderful remarks about our staff who always strive to ensure our guests have a memorable experience and delighted you enjoyed the Farmer's breakfast during your village tour and you have contributed to their livelihood in doing so as part of the proceeds go to the local family you visited. This activity is a favorite among most of our guests

The tents have a great design, the view over the lake is wonderful. But Flameback was definitely not our best Sri Lanka experience. The most important reason was lack of a simple fan in the tents. At night the temperature at the lake shore drops a few degrees, but not enough to be able to sleep with tent-doors open (klamboe closed off course) to enjoy the early morning birds. But Flameback tents are designed to close complete off and put A/C on. And that is exactly not the reason we choose for tents. Glamping (glamour tents) should enable us to really be in touch with nature, specially at night. The humming of an A/C with everything complete locked blocks that idea. Another thing which made us feel less in touch with nature is the main road, which is just a 100 meters away. There is not a lot a traffic, but the road does not add to the lodge and being isolated concept. Lunch was okay, dinner superb, with prices a bit expensive. Wine bottle cost over 6000 SLR. So were the room rates if we compare it with similar lodges. We really enjoyed the farmers breakfast: 30 minutes easy bike ride away: learn and see how local people live and work, with a superb breakfast and fresh buffalo milk.","Flameback: good but some concept issues","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r620613429-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

Apparently it’s normal to have security with guns go through your stuf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed at this hotel during the final leg of our Galle trip, as it was also the venue for a friend’s wedding. Sadly, what should’ve been a memorable night turned into a disaster — myself, my daughters, and around 20 other guests came down with food poisoning after the wedding dinner. Instead of enjoying our last day, we spent it recovering in bed and bracing for our flight out. Not exactly the send-off we imagined.

Because of that, I’m rating our stay 2.75 stars. Without the food poisoning, I would’ve given it 3.5 stars, thanks to the beautiful ocean views and charming colonial aesthetic.

That said, there were a few letdowns beyond the food. Our expectations were admittedly high after staying at a nearby five-star resort — but things like bird droppings on the balcony, confusing hot water taps, a worn-out pool area, and checkout staff who didn’t bother asking if we were okay or offer help with bags fell short. To top it off, we later found out other guests received breakfast boxes upon checkout — which we were never offered. A small thing, but it left a sour note (no pun intended).

The standout, however, was a wonderful housekeeping attendant on level 2, whose name I wish I’d written down. He went above and beyond — helping us get ready for the wedding, swiftly replacing vomit-soiled carpets the next day, and even bringing us flowers. His kindness and attention to detail were the only redeeming parts of our stay, and if it were up to me, he’d get 5 stars and a pay rise!

This hotel has potential — its history and character are undeniable. But if you’re expecting seamless five-star service and luxury, you may be left disappointed. I genuinely hope the management learns from this experience — and recognises the quiet hero on their housekeeping team who made a tough time just a little bit better.","This could have been a 3.5 star rating for me, but then we got food poisoning… so I’ve dropped it to 2.75 stars.","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r1001918850-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The oldest in Colombo and gives the full colonial experience. Service very old school and a pleasure to see. Room very spacious with all mod cons. I suppose that in giving a 3, I want somebody from the hotel to read this! Our problem was when we came to eat? We had already been to the pool-the biggest in our whole trip, with possibly the grumpiest lifeguard-but I will forgive him that! So, we looked at the menu at Firebeach and went back there…..what a mess! Maybe half the tables were filled. Nobody served us, so I got my own menus. I noted a gentleman on the next table also with a room key (a hotel guest) looking frustrated. Eventually I waved to somebody and at this point, the other gentleman is (‘quite rightly) upset as he has been waiting even longer than us! All of us expressed our feelings at not being served. We got a sort of an apology but nothing off the bill or a free drink. The food was average.
I could not identify who was in charge…and that was the main problem-it was completely disorganised. The staff in general seemed more interested in chatting to each other and nobody was ‘watching the room’. I am not a huge complainer, but this really hacked me off, because it was so unnecessary…..but the reality is that it is an integral part of the hotel-maybe the senior management don’t get down to the poolside too much?
We would have liked to have had breakfast which undoubtedly would have helped, but unfortunately we had a very early flight.","Lovely historic hotel- I think we were just unlucky!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r991900207-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

But there is a fine line between characterful atmosphere on the one hand, and tired and shabby on the other. I think this hotel is complacently trading on the former, but falling into the latter.  

The food is superb - the best dinner and breakfast buffets we had in a month in Sri Lanka, both in terms of quality and scope. The service is by and large efficient and friendly. And the location is wonderful, right on Galle Face Green and the sea.

However, the grubby swimming pool area definitely needs upgrading. The bedrooms are tired and shabby. There is NO sound-proofing between rooms - we could hear every detail of our poor neighbour's upset stomach during the night. And there is absolutely no excuse for copious mould in our ensuite bathroom in a hotel which claims an international standard. Of course none of this really matters, but for the high price they are charging for the rooms. If you  pay an international rate, you ought to be able to expect international standards.
Very disappointing stay, to be honest.

This was my 4th visit in the last 4 years and 4th stay at Galle Face. 

But this time I have to say, I did not enjoy my stay and perhaps next time will consider booking another hotel. While the hotel on the exterior is  impressive, the interiors are old and need a serious uplift. The carpets are smelly, the AC has a stench to it, typical to one that is very old. The room's interiors are not great. Except their highest category of room, all the other rooms are not impressive. They maybe bigger rooms comparatively but the quality of the room is low. I also found the rooms extremely used and lived in (not sure if this makes sense) and this gave me a weird feeling. The smell in the room from the AC really started to get to me and luckily I only stayed a night but I felt like I would have got sick had I had to stay another night. 

The hotel does have an unprecedented view of the ocean and its unique location is special, given how close it is to the ocean. That is one of the reasons I like to stay here. But this time, the hotel felt extremely busy, they had a lot of visitors, service was extremely slow and it was painful to keep waiting for a plate or extra cup in the room. The breakfast was below average and so was the breakfast service. Almost every night there was a wedding or event at the hotel, so it felt extremely noisy, busy and chaotic. In peak season time I would not recommend this property. 

I have to say the staff does try their best to make the stay comfortable and are very kind and polite. But the property did feel dated to me and all the flaws in the room did stand out a lot more this time than they have in the past. It still is a beautiful property but the room are just not good.","Dissapointing Stay","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r987455419-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

While the masseuse Renuka was very professional and did her best, sadly the setting of the massage room was not very relaxing or at least welcoming. 

While the previous occasions I stayed at the hotel (not the spa, this was my first time) was super great, this was a bit dissapointing. From Amaya Hills we expected better. 

To start with the massage room was really small and had hardly any space to move freely. The air was not so great to breathe, and i expected it to be aromatic or at least calming. I wasn't offered a robe and was seated on an arm chair, which wasn't comfortable at all.

While I got the relaxation through the massage, I developed a back pain by sitting in that ergonomically dead wrong chair.

Anyway the masseuse Renuka did her job well. Apart from that the only plus thing I saw about the whole thing was the prompt and flexible communication of Dr. Nirmani.

In a nutshell, the hotel management best attend improving the quality of the environment to be suited for a 4 star hotel spa.","The environment and the amenities in the massage rooms at the Amaya Hills spa could really use more improvement","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12220047-d480276-r1005251968-Amaya_Hills_Kandy-Heerassagala_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Maintaining such a large and beautiful garden is not easy, but Yoga handles it with great passion and commitment. His work adds to the charm of Amaya Hills, making it a perfect place to relax and enjoy nature. Along with the stunning surroundings, the food here is also amazing! Every dish is prepared with great taste and quality, making the dining experience even more enjoyable.

Beware the price of alcohol as the menu does not include taxes or service which adds a third to the price.","Great location but overall disappointing","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12220047-d480276-r967803945-Amaya_Hills_Kandy-Heerassagala_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Il luogo è decisamente affascinante, il panorama - foschia permettendo – è un vero sballo. Fanno da cornice picchi e valli di un verde esagerato.
Le ali dell’hotel sono a più piani ed ospitano le stanze in sequenza, arredate in modo sufficiente in stile old fashion anche se il mobilio presenta segni di stanchezza per l’onorato servizio, almeno in quella che mi è stata assegnata (N° 06).
Le camere non sono molto spaziose (circa 20 mq.) ed il layout rispecchia quello tradizionale delle più note catene alberghiere.
Il bagno è piuttosto piccolo – una persona ed è pieno – ed è corredato da una vasca tradizionale a fondo leggermente curvo, senza dotazioni antiscivolo, col rischio concreto di cadere e farsi male. Scatta perciò l’“operazione asciugamano” che steso bagnato sul fondo ripristina l’accident prevention. Anche qui vale la regola inglese di bidet = optional e si è provveduto ad aggiungere accanto al water il solito patetico spruzzino alternativo.
Il lavello, probabilmente in origine incassato nel ripiano, è stato nel tempo sostituito : il bordo di quello attuale appoggiato sopra (e con tracce di ruggine sul fondo esterno) arrivava a circa 110 cm. di altezza. Perfetto per un pivot, ma mia moglie ci arrivava a malapena in punta di piedi !!!
All’arrivo in camera ho verificato la presenza della cassaforte prevista e la gradita la dotazione di due bottiglie di complimentary water subito messe nel frigobar per bercele in freschezza. L’aria condizionata, non indispensabile per l’altitudine, era però utile per il controllo dell’umidità : a raccordare il contrasto c’era un avvolgente soffice piumone.
La ristorazione offre in prevalenza cucina singalese e trascura quella internazionale, quasi inesistente. La scelta di cibi in generale, anche locali, è molto meno ampia e curata della consorella Amaya Lake. Per dovere di cronaca va detto che era disponibile il …. gelato.
La colazione ha identiche caratteristiche di scarsità di scelte e qualità.
Il personale di tavola è veloce ed efficiente. Il vino (ovviamente a pagamento) veniva servito nel secchiello con ghiaccio.
Il bar occupa un ambiente interno risicato e anche i dehors non sono da meno. Abbiamo passato una delle due serale happy hour gustando un aperitivo. L’altra coincideva con la “Festa della Luna Piena” ed era assolutamente …. analcolica (nessuno escluso).
Tenendo conto di quanto riscontrato, la valutazione di **** dichiarata dall'hotel risulta essere sovrastimata di almeno una *.","SI PUO' MIGLIORARE","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12220047-d480276-r947672239-Amaya_Hills_Kandy-Heerassagala_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Once we were processed and in our room we had half a roll of toilet paper and just 2 hangers for our clothes, which seemed a bit miserly. We ate 2 nights at the hotel. The first night we tried to order a cocktail in the restaurant bar but despite the cocktail menus, no-one there could make them so we went up to the rooftop bar and discovered they also do food up there. I ordered a pork curry which I couldn't eat as the meat was fatty and chewy. My wife ordered the crab curry and was amazed to find that, rather than being served with fresh roti or some other local accompaniment, it came with 4 slices of toast (cheap sliced bread). The following night a lot of places were closed due to the national independence day so we ate again at the hotel and there was a special buffet. It was not bad but when I tried some of the beef curry I had the same issue as the previous night and couldn't eat it. On the positive side, the views are amazing, but many of the staff are quite young and lacking in skills. Basic questions are hard to get answers to, eg ""is the breakfast a buffet?"".

Es ist recht klein, was nicht schlimm ist.
Im Erdgeschoss verfügt es  über eine. „Multifunktionsfläche, die alles in einem Lobby, Rezeption, Restaurant und Pool-Area ist.

Der Pool sieht zwar optisch gut aus, ist aber faktisch unbrauchbar. 
Um zum Pool zu gelangen muss man durchs Restaurant gehen, auf dem Rückweg dementsprechend auch. 
Insgesamt nur 6 Liegen und eine Sitzgarnitur stehen am Pool, an der Aussentüre zu Küche.
Diese scheint zwei Kühlschränke in den Poolbereich  ausgelagert zu haben, deren Lüfter den Aufenthalt reichlich beeinträchtigen.

Das Essen ist nicht schlecht, aber auch nicht wirklich gut.
Der Service ist mittelmäßig und nicht sehr aufmerksam. 
Bei der Rezeptionistin muss man leider eine gewisse Arroganz und Unfreundlichkeit  feststellen. 
Das Personal vermittelte, anders als in den anderen von uns in Sri Lanka besuchten Hotels, nicht das Engagement, die Freundlichkeit und die Herzlichkeit. Die Freundlichkeit z.B. an der Rezeption war aufgesetzt und nicht authentisch.

Die Zimmer sind schön und modern eingerichtet.
Die Sauberkeit im Zimmer war ohne Tadel.
Von den Balkons hat man einen reizvollen Blick auf Kandy.
Störend war, dass auf den Etagenfluren, vor den Zimmern, ganztägig viel zu lautes Musik-Gedudel aus den Lautsprechern tönt. Dies ist vollkommen unnütz und geradezu störend.  
Von den 5 besuchten Hotels während unserer Sri Lanka-Reise, kommt das Grand Serendib auf den fünften und letzten Platz.

Queríamos pagar con tarjeta y nos pidió que si podíamos pagarle las Coca Colas en efectivo, sin siquiera modificarnos la cuenta (es normal pensar mal) Finalmente nos cobró todo en tarjeta por lo mucho que insistimos y tuvimos que bajar a recepción para pedir el ticket corregido. 2) Había obras en el hotel y eran las 10:00 PM y seguían dando martillazos. Tuvimos que llamar a recepción para reclamar y a la primera no hicieron nada, luego volvimos a llamar y finalmente dejaron los ruidos, para empezarlos nuevamente a las 6:00 AM. 3) En el último día de desayuno me serví una especie de pancakes que tenían, que aparentemente no eran pancakes, las cuales me serví con sirope de chocolate, y vino una cocinera a decirme que eso no se comía así, que se servía con curry. No veo normal que el personal de un hotel venga a decirme cómo tengo que servirme y combinar las cosas en mi plato.
Por lo demás, bien. La habitación espaciosa y limpia, cama cómoda y buenas vistas. La piscina también tiene buenas vistas aunque quizás el área se queda pequeño si en algún momento tienen ocupado la mayoría del hotel (durante nuestra estancia estuvo bastante vacío así que no tuvimos ese problema)

The rooms are lovely and the facilities are very good. BUT, the staff “saved” some turtles when they hatched the morning of arrival and told us they’d be setting them off into the ocean that afternoon. That time came, and a tunnel of people was formed for the turtles to make their way down into the sea. The staff thought it would be good to get the kids involved, it wasn’t. They first started their journey to the sea with a dog almost eating them, luckily it was stopped. When the turtles got close to the sea (and everyone was huddled round them trying to record it, probably making it an even more scary experience for them than it already was)  the staff told the kids to help the turtles along (which wouldn’t be the case in a natural birth) then the kids started to grab, squeeze and throw these poor little turtles. To which the parents didn’t stop them and it all got a bit heated. This all should’ve been stopped immediately by staff, which it wasn’t. So what was meant to be a nice release for them to give them an advantage of not being killed before reaching the water, actually resulted in the animals being harmed by disobedient children, parents that fail to control their kids and staff that clearly cared more about getting cute videos to promote themselves on social media than the animals welfare. I spoke to the manager and he didn’t seem to know anything about it, but told me he’d speak to the staff. Hopefully, the manager takes my complaint seriously to stop this reoccurring.","Nice hotel and facilities, but poorly treated turtles","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d23262280-r999751724-Araliya_Beach_Resort_Spa-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We sincerely apologize for the disappointing experience you had with both our customer service and the room arrangements during your stay. We understand how frustrating it must have been to encounter delays and a lack of communication, especially when you expected to have access to the apartment amenities.

It’s concerning to hear that the staff was unaware of the apartment setup and that your requests were not addressed in a timely and professional manner. This is not the level of service we aim to provide, and we’ll be looking into this situation to ensure better clarity and responsiveness in the future.

We deeply regret the inconvenience you faced with our housekeeping team and will work on improving communication and training to make sure such issues do not happen again.

Please know that your feedback is invaluable, and we are committed to making improvements based on your experience. We hope you’ll consider giving us another opportunity to make it right on your next visit.

First we checked in and were just give a room designed for disabled guests. We didn’t know until we got into our room. There are amenities designed for disabled guests. The problem is, the drains were smelly and water went everywhere when we showered. So as it was on the first floor, we could hear the loud disco music from the lobby, not pleasant at all.

We were then give a better room on a higher floor the next day, but the room wasn’t that great too, the shower door stop was broken and there was a heavy layer of dust on some of the shelves. Definitely not what I expect from a resort like this.

We tried to relax on the hotel managed area of the beach but the blasted very loud music, so it wasn’t great if you want to just relax.

Other than that the stay wasn’t remarkable. Food was decent. 

I guess this was more an issue of the Unawatuna area than specifically of the hotel itself, this hotel and the surrounding area was filled with Russians, while I have nothing against them, many of the tourist amenities are geared towards them, and it could mean non Russian preferred options could be limited in the area.

Пляж хорошо оформлен, огорожен. Так как это бухта, там меньше волн чем на открытой воде, как следствие большое количество лодок которые норовят приплыть по голове. 
Номера большие, убирают хорошо, но абсолютно не следят за мелочами, перегоревшие лампочки, отваливающиеся крепление душа, разбитый пульт, нет переходников на розетки, обои в пятнах, на подушках были следы как будто их топтали, протекающая раковина. (все это явно не стоит 200$ за ночь).

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at Araliya Beach Resort and Spa Unawatuna. We genuinely appreciate both your positive comments and your constructive feedback.

I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed the spacious room, stunning beach view, and the friendliness of our staff, especially those in reservations and the room boy. It’s also great to know that you found our clubhouse and beach area to be well-maintained and enjoyable.

However, I am truly sorry to learn about the issues you encountered. Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused:

I understand that being asked to pay at check-in was an unusual experience for you. But we at Araliya Beach resort its a usual practice that we acquire the room payment upon check in. This may vary from hotel to hotel yet most hotels follow the same practice.  

I regret that the damp floor affected your comfort. Your room was released as soon as our housekeeping team have cleaned the room hence the floor dampness was there. 

I am very sorry that our food quality and service did not meet your expectations. Your comments about the saltiness of the food, slow refills, and missing utensils are concerning, and we will investigate these issues with our culinary and service teams to make necessary improvements.

Your feedback is invaluable to us, and I assure you that it will be used to make necessary improvements. We are committed to providing a better experience for all our guests, and your insights play a crucial role in helping us achieve this goal.

Thank you once again for your feedback. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with an improved experience.

First I called the general number and check the availability and one guy said sir we are fully booked and no rooms available.which I didn’t trust. Then I called the mobile number which they have mentioned on the web site and I was able to make a reservation without any issue. That’s the start of my disappointment.

At the time of the arrival reservation was so busy but they were nice and quickly gave me a room. The reservation staff is friendly and the room boy was so nice he explained each and everything in the room and was very helpful young guy. I was asked to do the payment at the time of the check in it self. Which was my very first experience and I was surprised with that. None of the hotels I have been never ask to do the payment at the check in which I was not so happy about.

The room was very spacious and nice they have mopped the room few minutes before check in and the water and the moisture was on the floor for quite some time which we were not so comfortable of. They have arranged an extra bed as requested  as well. Both the beds were clean and so comfortable where we had a very nice sleep. The view of the beach is was breathtaking which is a plus point.

I had lot of expectations on the dinner but to my surprise it was not tasty at all. My wife was complaining food is salty. There were not much of varieties and not much of a speed compared to the other hotels. We were at the saffron buffet area which is very congested. The staff was very friendly and nice but turned refills of food was very slow and I felt that the waiters were not trained properly as they were struggling while the service was on going. When we finish the salads and went and came to get the meat items, when we came back our forks and  spoons gone missing and it was not replaced. So we had to call the waiters again and again for spoons and forks . This was happened at dinner breakfast and lunch which was very uncomfortable for us. 

The breakfast was comparatively ok. At the breakfast also we experienced the refilling issue they had baked beans which was almost over and it was not replaced till we finished with the juice finishing our meal. We were a bit happy as the breakfast was fair compared to the dinner. But there is no factor to say it’s excellent as we had the issue of the taste of the food same as the dinner.

After breakfast we went to the club house area which was nice and spacious. Then we were in the beach which they keep the area very nice and tidy. We had clean towels friendly staff which made us happy.

At tie time of lunch I saw a bit of a variety compared to a bad dinner. They had mutton instead of pork and the beef was nice. But for dessert they only had watermelon  and pineapple which was not that great as the fruits for dessert. But there were good quantity of other dessert such as cheese cakes etc.
I ad to tell them 3 times to clean the plate wbch we had salad , meat items and d the main dish  was Lon the table while we were having the dessert which made us so unfordable. They took the plates out after telling it to 3 different people 3 times. This was not precessional at all.

Overall what I can say is that the place is nice the rooms are clean and spacious with all the required amenities and fully hightech. 

The view is very nice from the room and you can have a good view of the entire area when you go to the viewing deck at the rooftop.

Most of the people are nice and helpful while others were just minding their own business and just running around. 

When it come to food I would give 4 out of 10. Which need to be drastically improved. As the main thing which people check at a hotel is the meal experience. 

The staff needs to be trained more and they have to be more professional as well. I do not think that I will go there again.","Not much impressed and I won’t go again","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d23262280-r965982707-Araliya_Beach_Resort_Spa-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Stair climbing is required as the restaurant is up a level up from the ground. The food was very good with a variety of Sri Lankan and western options. The restaurant gets very busy and noisy. The staff were continually busy refilling the buffet offerings which meant it was hotter than at many buffets. Each meal had something being cooked fresh – BBQ at dinner, omelette and bacon at breakfast, noodles at lunch. The room was small. We had a sea view, but many of the rooms overlook the pool and would be noisy. The air conditioning is centrally controlled and too hot for us overnight. There were no hand towels in the bathroom. When we asked for them, we were given face washers. The grounds are very nice and well maintained. The sea was too rough for swimming and the pool full of children (it was a weekend when we arrived).

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We deeply regret that your experience did not meet your expectations and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you faced during your visit.

Regarding your comments about the reception, I am truly sorry to hear that you felt our team was not welcoming. This is certainly not the level of service we strive to provide. Thanuja, who has received numerous positive comments for her friendly and helpful nature, will be addressed to ensure that all guests feel respected and comfortable at all times. We will also provide additional training to our reception staff to improve their communication and service.

I understand your concerns about the lack of a common changing area. Our hotel policy is to offer day-use rooms for guests who wish to have private changing facilities. Unfortunately, we do not have a dedicated common changing room. However, your feedback is valuable, and we will consider how we might better communicate this information in the future to avoid any misunderstandings.

I'm glad to hear you appreciated the kindness of our play area staff and enjoyed the variety of activities we offer, including volleyball, badminton, table tennis, and water polo. We aim to provide a range of amenities for all our guests to enjoy, and it's good to know that this part of your visit was positive.

Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced and thank you for your honest feedback. We hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a more enjoyable experience in the future.

Bad:
1.The reception was incredibly rude and mean to us. I don't know if it was because we were locals, but here’s my warning if you are planning to go for a day out: they didn’t have any changing rooms. Not even a common changing area. I asked where my sister and I could change after getting into the pool, and the two ladies at the reception pointed us to the bathroom at the entrance. It didn’t even have a shower—just toilets. They didn’t seem to care at all. The look on the senior receptionist’s face (if I’m not mistaken, her name was Thanuja) was sarcastic, and she had such an attitude. 

It cost us Rs. 6,500 per person, but it wasn’t worth the money. I checked Booking.com too, and there are many bad reviews about the reception. We had an argument as soon as we entered, and it ruined the entire mood. There weren’t even lockers or a safe place to keep our bags. They said we could leave them on the sofa in front of the reception. I think they need to understand that women can’t remove their clothes outside or change in a tiny bathroom that only has toilets. And it’s located in front of the hotel, so we had to walk all the way back to the reception to change.

2. The hotel doesn't look that good as it is shown in the photos.

Good:
1. The staff that was there in the play area (separated from a wall) was so kind to us. They only let us use the bathroom of the spa area to change. That was extremely kind. 
2. They had a lot of games to play like volleyball, badminton, table tennis, a gym, and water polo.","Disappointing Experience: Rude Reception and bad first impression","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d316671-r967999190-Mermaid_Hotel_Club-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",
