I am sorry that you thought the pool very small. It is a plunge pool and that is what we state on our website etc, so we have never promised an Olympic sized pool!

You appeared from your room at midday asking for breakfast, whereas  in fact that was the time you were due to have checked out by. You were offered King coconut, which you declined. Meal times are clearly set out int the welcome letter in the rooms, and breakfast finishes at 10.30.

Like many other hotels in Sri Lanka, we do not offer driver's accommodation, and for some very good reasons. When you checked in, the Hotel manager gave you details of a guest house for your driver which is very close to the hotel, so I fail to see what the problem is. Maybe you were simply expecting us to provide free accommodation for your driver?

This is all very sad, considering the staff made a special effort for you dinner the night before for your anniversary, with a set up in the garden, flowers etc, none of which we charged for.  

Yours sincerely,

There was no space to leave or put my suitcase as I didn’t want to unpack the huge suitcase for my last 2 days. No chair in the room, the table Next to the bed so small, I could not leave a book or anything there, phone and plugs so dirty, the bathroom also very run down and dirty. 
As a reply to my complaint, that the room is really a joke and not worth the money, I was offered to leave the hotel and find somewhere else to stay. Since I didn’t want to spend the last days searching the web or surroundings for alternative hotels and since I liked the decor and premises of the hotel, I asked for a free Upgrade... which of course was denied and again, the arrogance of the hotel manager was quite something, when he again offered me to happily leave the hotel. 
I didn’t want to spoil my last holiday days and stayed there in the end but was very, very unhappy about the whole situation and ignorance. 
The room was also dirty and would need a serious clean and renovation.

We are pleased that you enjoyed your recent stay with us. Every aspect of the hotel has been designed with much thought and care to ensure that all our guests are treated to a unique experience. Our team is committed to serve our guests to the fullest capacity but in the event of the hotel being at 100% occupancy room changes can be extremely limited. 

As we are a unique private hotel with a small inventory of rooms the hotel is not crowded as you may witness in larger hotels. Guests who stay in private hotels generally seek privacy and prefer a calm and quiet environment for which we cater well. We can assure you that the pricing in our menus are in par with similar establishments. The passing train certainly does add to the whole charm and experience.

Thank you for reviewing Paradise Road The Villa Bentota.

We appreciate your feedback about your recent stay at our hotel. While we thank you for your comments about staff service and food it is quite unfortunate that you were not able to spend all three days at The Villa as planned. 

The interior of the hotel has been designed with much thought and care to ensure that our guests are treated to a unique experience. The rooms are of certain dark tones which is part of the total design. We can assure you that our guests who stay at The Villa are quite attracted to its design, antiques and art on display. The whole property is an artistic expression which is much appreciated by many. 

We have noted your comments about the room upgrade. While it is a management decision to offer a free upgrade, an upgrade fee is imposed in any hotel in the country for any guest who wishes to be accommodated in higher room category. This is a common practice in hotels in Sri Lanka. The railway tracks certainly does add to the whole charm of the property and it runs along the coast in most parts in the south neighboring most of the beach resorts.

It is a nice hotel but let me explain why we decided to go:

- we arrived and were put in a very small room, yes, it was very cheap so fair enough. However, I found it very dark and depressing. This may well have been due to the fact that the weather was awful but none the less not a room that I wanted to spend time in. 
- The bathroom was tiny and in need of a revamp. 
- I asked the front desk if they had any larger rooms available. I very much expected them to say yes seeing as the hotel was virtually empty. However, they said that they had no more standard rooms left and I would have to pay 50 USD a night to upgrade, this was then lowered to 40. To be honest I wasn't willing to pay extra for a room when it was still gloomy. 
- as I've said above the place was so empty, to the extent that it felt odd. Eating dinner with one other couple is a weird atmosphere.
- little to do in surrounding area.
- train woke me up in the night. Yes it is charming but equally not ideal! 

There were positives:

- food was delicious and the included breakfast was very nice.
- staff were great from the start - when we said we were leaving they were extremely apologetic and offered an upgrade. 
- decor is nice but not to my taste as I've said I found it dark and gloomy.
- nice pool and right by the beach.

We booked to have a quiet 3 nights at the end of our trip but unfortunately it was a little too quiet for us. It does look like the best hotel in the area though after looking at others. 

Must add again that the staff and food were brilliant.

Thank you for reviewing Paradise Road The Villa Bentota.

Every aspect of the hotel has been designed with much thought and care which makes this a unique property. You may not find such taste in design in any establishment except at Paradise Road Tintagel Colombo. 

Paradise Road Hotels are known to its impeccable design, food & beverage and service that is offered to all guests who patronize our establishments. Our pricing is in par with other private hotels in the country. 

The rail tracks run along the coastal line in the south of Sri Lanka and most beach front properties face a similar situation although most guests find it charming and an added experience to their stay.

We are so grateful that you have taken the time to share your experience and appreciate your positive feedback on your stay with us.

We are sorry that you had to undergo a discomfort due to the malfunction of the cooling unit. Unfortunately, as you know this is one of the warmest seasons of the year where the sun comes direct on top of Sri Lanka and we are currently experiencing the worst heat in our countries history. Unfortunately the room you were in the compressor was overloaded during this time and had created an air block which interrupt the cooling process. 

We pride ourselves on the style and concept of our brand and we continue to offer some of the most competitive rates for a boutique hotel in the south with an intimate setting amongst only 16 other rooms and a unique  food menu similar to our award winning restaurant in the city.

Luckily we were quickly given new rooms to stay in, but it was rather inconvenient moving from room to room.

Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are glad to hear you enjoyed the architecture of Paradise Road The Villa Bentota and our breakfast. 

Our outdoor spaces for Suites without garden views unfortunately cannot be air conditioned and mosquitoes are an unavoidable circumstance of our climate. The small staircase to reach your room is part of the original architecture of the Villa Mohotti which remains untouched, and while in some cases seems inconvenient, in others adds to the charm of the original villa built by Geoffrey Bawa. 

In regards to your unsatisfactory tandoori meal we will discuss this with the chef. We don't serve fine dining and therefore aim to ensure all our portions are of generous sizes and apologise for yours being smaller than you had hoped for. 

In response to your complaint about the cancellation fee through agoda we request that you take this up with the booking agent directly. The no cancellation policy and fee takes place from their end as the booking was made through them and we cannot refund the amount to you from our offices.

We do hope you enjoyed your stay in Sri Lanka and we hope you will visit our island again soon!

- Dinner was mediocre. Very small portions of inauthentic tandoori chicken.

Due to a misunderstanding (we booked and paid for our room through our travel agent), the original booking made directly with Agoda was never properly canceled. We found this out five days prior to our arrival, and quickly canceled the Agoda reservation, resulting in a $280 cancellation fee - for ONE night! I was in the travel industry for 40 years, and I understand - rules are rules. (We did not no-show; the hotel was full that night.) When I spoke to the manager, he was a total blank: everything about his body language said NO. So be it - but his customer service skills were zero.

We enjoyed sitting in the bar area & watching the rains...
The cons: food is limited & very expensive by local standards, there is no breakfast spread - you can choose between american or sri lankan breakfast that is served at your table. For eg - at breakfast orange juice was to be paid for, but not watermelon or pineapple juice. I did not understand the logic behind that. Secondly, and most appalling, when we asked for a couple of bananas for our son, they billed it as a banana milkshake & charged a fortune for that! Even though we paid for it & gave a feedback, no one bothered to explain or justify the same.

Thank you for posting your review on your recent experience at Paradise Road The Villa Bentota! We value our guests' comments and use them constructively to allow us to continually improve our services. 

As with all reviews received, we do an internal check with all staff concerned. Daham confirmed that you had booked a Villa Room for your stay and were allocated Superior Room 7 which features a large shared balcony and one of the largest bathrooms in the category with a separate bathtub and shower. 
Shutters are present only in the bathroom, whilst Roman blinds feature on the bedroom french doors. 

We sincerely apologise for the unexpected malfunction in the air conditioning and understand that staff attended to it before you alerted them as they heard the noise and thought it was resolved within 20min. However, we understand that the air conditioner did not cool thereafter. We sincerely wish you had alerted us, but understand that with a small child, moving rooms at that time despite the heat may have been more difficult for you. 
We are pleased you enjoyed the features of the Superior Suite you were upgraded to due to the inconvenience experienced. 

We are terribly sorry for the poor massage treatment you experienced and all points mentioned are not acceptable and will be attended to to ensure they are not repeated. We do apologize for the mosquitoes and will ensure next time that more is done to repel them in advance of guests' massages. Mosquitoes are a battle throughout our tropical island.

The train track is a feature of our property and enjoyed by many. There are a few who find it a hindrance and we do understand that. We and neighbouring properties have alerted the authorities about the 'horn' of the train which can be loud, we are yet to see action taken. Again, it is a feature which is not appreciated by everyone and we are sorry that it inconvenienced you. 

September / October are the quietest months of the year at hotels on the South Coast and therefore why you would have enjoyed more privacy than perhaps wanted! December, January through till April are the best months to visit the coast and therefore are a lot busier. However, we do find many guests who enjoy the quiet of the hotel during this season and don't wish to venture to the beach which is not pleasant at this time of year.

Our property has complimentary wi-fi in all public areas. We do not offer it in all the rooms, although we do in our Colombo hotel which is frequented by business travellers. 

We hope to welcome you again to The Villa Bentota!

Yours in Service,

The Management

The first night was awful. We were given a standard room. It looked like a pretty box. There were shutters instead of blinds and we felt really claustrophobic and depressed in the room. Even the bathroom was grey and dingy. To make matters worse, during the night, the power on our ac packed up with a loud noise.  It was so loud that we thought there was a train going through our room! It woke our little baby up and then we were up all night with no ac. 

The manager, Daham, was very courteous, helpful and competent. He arranged for us to be upgraded to a suite. The suite was beautiful, light and airy. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our second night at the Villa. If only, the first night was as pleasant. The manager also arranged massages. My husbands massage was great but unfortunately mine was not so good. The masseuse was unprofessional. It seemed like she couldn't really be bothered to give a massage and was just rubbing oil on me. She also placed her mobile on the bed which kept vibrating near my legs which was irritating. The room again was like a box and Mosquitos flying around everywhere. 

We found it really odd that there was a train track right behind the pool.  Even though the beach was close, it felt wrong carrying our baby over the train track to get to the beach! I also felt the train was really loud. 

The food in the restaurant was the best we had in Sri Lanka. The curries were so sumptuous. My only criticism was that it was expensive by Sri Lankan standards. 

Even though the service was lovely and the boutique hotel beautiful, it had no buzz whatsoever. There were only 2 other guests and it felt like a ghost town. Both times at breakfast, my husband and I were the only ones in the restaurant. The bar area was always empty, and no bar men serving either. Perhaps this was due to it being low season so I guess it shouldn't be a problem during the peak season. 

By the way, there is no wi-fi in the rooms. Something they should look into....","Tasteful interiors and lovely food but deserted hotel","2013-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r180204280-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I stayed here in 2011 and was swept out to sea with my 11-year old son from the beach.  We were standing in the breaking waves and before we knew what was happening, we were pulled out to sea.  The speed of the riptide was breathtaking.  We were 400 meters out to sea, and there were no rescue facilities at all.  We were drifting for a full hour before a couple of locals came to save us by paddling out with kick-boards.

There are no signs warning of the dangerous rip-tide, despite management knowing about this.

It’s a designer’s dream! It has an authentic charm and you can keep making pictures everywhere because everything looks so beautiful. It is really ‘out of a magazine’ like some previous review says.
Unfortunately, we have to agree with Julie S (see her review) that once the initial high is over, you cannot help feeling disappointed about the service and the staff. 
We arrived quite late. It was already dark. Our driver (who was supposed to stay with us for 5 days) was rudely turned down, since there is no driver accommodation at the hotel. He had to go out and look for a place to sleep himself. Now, this is also a fault of his company, they had to check it before arrival, but we sure felt embarrassed by the way the reception staff treated the man.
After they showed us our room (which was indeed beautiful, just as the pictures on the website promised) we went for dinner. Bentota was our last stop on our journey and we had experienced a lot of genuine kindness from the staff at our previous hotels. At The Villa we were unpleasantly surprised by the restaurant staff’s attitude. They were almost rude. No smiles, no kindness, … They kept that attitude until the day we checked out. Then suddenly the smiles appeared (as if they were happy we left).
Next day we had the chance to see the resort in all its glory and indeed it is wonderful. But like the previous review mentioned, after a few hours the poolside looks like a mess. When people leave, no one cleans up. Used towels, glasses, clothes  … everything stays where it is and you have to search for a clean place yourself.
Since this hotel presents itself as boutique luxury (and so are the prices!)we surely expected a little more. We are happy to have stayed here, because of the beauty of the premises, but we would definitely choose another hotel the next time. I think there are a lot of alternatives that are as beautiful and with the same authentic character, but with better service!","Mixed feelings...","2013-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r157680758-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

When we were showed to our suite, we were immediately disappointed - the room was dark, scruffy and damp. It certainly didn't feel like a suite! We immediately asked to change rooms and were thankfully moved to a suite on the first floor which was lighter and drier. The hotel had supposedly undergone a refurb - it was a bad refurb. There were stains, scratches, dirt - and a general lack of attention to detail. 

On the plus side the outdoor and public areas were great - great pool, sun loungers, close to the beach and nice bar area. The staff were friendly and helpful. The beach is across the rail tracks so be prepared to see and hear a few trains go by. 

The food was nice however we ate dinner out. Top tip - go to Malli's and avoid Amal restaurant at all costs!

Overall we felt disappointed because of the bad standard of the suites and we felt like we didn't get value for money.","Beautiful surroundings but the suites leave a lot to be desired - disappointing","2013-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r153011881-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We decided not to say anything as we were only in the room for 2 nights (I booked late and was told we would have to move to room 2 for our 3rd night) When it was time for us to check into our new room we checked with the on duty manager at the time and he explained that he would try to keep us in the same room, we said that would be ok but we did not want to pay that rate as the room was damp, he gave us a surprised look and said he would check it out and let us know later. We waited around the pool until nearly midday and left for lunch, in our return the staff seemed a little relived to see us as we needed to move rooms immediately so new guests could move into suite 2.  The manager who was dealing with it never spoke with us again, I assume he didn't think our complaint was valid and it was easier for us to move to room 2, this was a fine room but the bathroom did smell, I had seen this complaint on here before.

But the service was a huge let down - it just didn't match up to what the place purports to be: a small, luxury hotel for the discerning traveller. Basically, 2 star service in 5 star surroundings - no class, no quality, no style. The first greeting statement when we arrived was ""give us your credit cards now"", and that was pretty much a continuing theme. Which leaves a bit of a nasty taste, as all that beauty is undermined by a persistent feeling that money, money, money is what is driving the place. We found that orders for food and drink were consistently wrongly taken, took ages to arrive, and also that staff (with the exception of the wonderful pool staff) had no real wish to serve pleasantly, promptly or politely. As it as one of my guest's birthday, we requested dinner at a special table outside (as advertised on the website) - and were tole ""no, it's too much trouble for us to do that"". Finally the front desk staff grudgingly agreed ... and when dinner-time arrived ... nothing! ""Oh, we forgot, and there are alot of mosquitoes"" we were told, as we eventually sat down in the restaurant to a rather average meal. the maintenance is also quite poor - the balcony doors came off their hinges, the bathroom was moldy and stank horribly of urine all around the toilet area, and the sheets also smelt pretty rank. So overall - Paradise Road, you've got the location beautifully right, but the service just doesn't match. Not even close.","Rather disappointing - poor service in a great location","2011-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r117690799-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

If you get offered what you feel is a 3* room rate it’s a hotel worth considering - if not I would look at alternatives.

The food selection was extremely limited. I practically survived on just rice because nothing else was appealing. For a hotel of this standard, I expected way better variety and quality.
The reception staff was superficial and misleading(except one guy named Praneeth, who was very genuine) . When we inquired about a day-use room or late check-out, they first acted like they would “do their best” to arrange something. I never expected it to be free, yet they lied, claiming the hotel was fully booked—even though Booking.com clearly showed available rooms. A few days later, their manager suddenly offered a room but at an high price—way above the actual rate. When we showed him the Booking.com price and said we’d just book it ourselves, his attitude completely changed. To make things worse, on our last night, I had booked a room without dinner, but I mistakenly thought it was included. We had dinner, and instead of handling it professionally, the restaurant staff literally ran after us as we were leaving, demanding payment. It was confusing, and they escorted us to their manager like we were trying to steal food or avoid paying. Seriously? Just add it to the room bill or find a more respectful way to handle it. The whole situation was embarrassing and completely unnecessary.
On a positive note, the cleaning staff were extremely friendly and nice. They were always polite and ready to assist with a smile, which was a refreshing contrast to the reception staff..","Disappointed","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r996154733-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Had disappointing stay.

Beautiful place but not as beautiful and big as the pictures, clean rooms, very kind housekeepers but the staff were not so friendly and tried not help, specially females! we were 2 ladies and asked for ladies pad but they gave us just 1 pad after 2 days and said they don't have any ladies pad in the hotel! how is that possible? even in every public washrooms there is ladies pad too but in a 5 star hotel.. very disappointing. the location is not closed to any pharmacy or supermarket so we couldn't buy it by ourselves and they didn't help us!

As a 5 star beach resort no seafood on the menu and also no international food. just local food full of spice and we actually didn't eat any food for 4 days!

to everything we ordered, added 30% tax and service charge. what does it mean ""service charge"" for a 5 star hotel to bring our order just to our table not even to our room?????!!!!!!

also not possible to use the beach because it was very dangerous and there was just 1 man looked at us and didn't seem to rescue us if anything happened! and just 4 unclean plastic sunbeds on the beach, so many dogs slept under them!

many many crows were all over the hotel and stole our foods and very scary but everyone just watched and didn't do anything! when we told the manager he just said we can't do anything, watch out your things!!!!

no entertainment, no music just some entertainment plans that costs a lot plus 30%!!

overall its not worth it to book this hotel. we heard there are many better hotels in the area.","not a 5 star, very disappointing","2024-09","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r968651187-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Из плюсов: 
➕Близость к океану
➕Красивая территория 
➕Возможность попробовать местную кухню 

Минусов конечно больше:
➖Будьте готовы что полотенца (в номер) иногда приходится прям выпрашивать! Все бы ничего, но при их влажности они просто не сохнут, а вытираться на второй день мокрым, ну как то не хочется 
➖ Та же проблема и с водой: чаще всего ее дают 2 -3 маленькие бутылочки на 2их в сутки
➖ Банные принадлежности тоже за неделю дали 2 раза
➖В ресторане официанты чаще стоят и болтают, когда что то просишь, идут нехотя и очень долго. Кстати в ресторане тоже проблема с водой… приходится реально гонятся за ними со стаканом
➖ На пляже ооочень надоедливые тук тукеры! Просто кошмар какой-то! И они целый день там сидят
➖Уборка номера неплохая, но косметическая скажем так. Паутины на потолке и пыль на декорациях их не смущает
➖ Ну и мягко говоря «уставшие» полотенца и постельное белье….","Если бы знала все нюансы, то наверное не поехала бы …","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r946028066-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

While some aspects of our stay were enjoyable, several issues arose that we believe future guests should be aware of.

One of the most frustrating issues we encountered was the malfunctioning TV remote. We had to complain twice before it was addressed, which was a minor inconvenience but still an annoyance that could have been avoided.

The most significant problem, however, was the absence of a lift in the hotel. This was a major oversight on the hotel's part, as they failed to inform us of this prior to our booking. Imagine if we had an elderly family member with us who was physically unable to climb stairs; it would have been a major problem. This information should have been communicated clearly during the booking process so that guests can make informed decisions.

Furthermore, we were disappointed that the hotel only mentioned the possibility of a room upgrade once we had already checked in. This offer was not mentioned during our initial phone reservation, which left us feeling as though we were not given all the available options when booking.

On a positive note, the room service was commendable. The staff responsible for room service were prompt, efficient, and courteous. They helped to alleviate some of the frustration caused by the aforementioned issues.

We must also commend the hotel staff for their friendly and welcoming demeanor. Despite the shortcomings of our stay, the staff's attitude was a bright spot in our overall experience.","A Mixed Bag","2023-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r919593037-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

I was rather disappointed though - the Rooms were spacious, but the AC was not very cold. Facilities are good - great pool, by the beach (though the water is very choppy at this time of the year), and Avani guests can also use the facilities offered by Anantara. 

Front office is generally Ok, except for the room key that didnt work (arrived at the hotel at 1.45AM) & mishaps with the packed breakfasts (despite multiple reminder of the requests, they had somehow forgot and the FO on duty was clueless (despite having taken the request the day before). Both incidents involved the same FO staff. Anyway, the incident was reported to the FO Manager & i hope he will follow up accordingly (i.e. more training/ coaching & there should be standard operating procedures on packed breakfasts - afterwall, very early morning tour is common in Sri Lanka).   Honestly, showing guests they matter doesn’t require a big budget, just some good old-fashioned hospitality. Simple efforts to make guests feel welcome. h

Shout out to Manoj (from the Restaurant) and Nishant (from the Pool) for going the extra mile - its the little things that count, they get to know the guests and pay attention to guests preferences e.g., on day 3, Manoj remember my breakfast preferences (despite having eaten on site on day 1).  and Nishant is always greeting guests (& find out on the planned activities for the day & if it involves the pool area, he will set up the pool deck chairs. 

The restaurant a la carte menu was ok, good range of selection & includes local Sri Lankan food.

We arrived around 1.pm on a Saturday and waited awkwardly a lobby. We were met by a person who gave us our room and a quick refreshment. While the overall service was quick and efficient, there was none of the warmth that I have been looking for (which was mentioned by many of its previous customers!) There wasn't a hint of a smile or warmth here. However a kindly gentleman who took our bags more than made up for it. (Pardon me but forget their names). 

However a special note must be made for their housekeeping manager Jeewan who went out of his way to make us feel welcome. (Maybe he can greet guests at the front office?) 

Come lunch the food was tasty but the portion size was ridiculous. My husband who is a hearty eater had to go looking for snacks in the Galle town around 4 as the meal barely met the need. 
Our dinner was also delicious and the portion was also not too bad. Only issue was that in a seafood grill dish the prawn was mushy and clearly spoiled. Being 4 months pregnant this could have ended quite badly for me if not for my crazy sensitive senses! We made a note on this and the chef himself was gracious enough to apologise and try to take care of us. This doesn't however excuse the fact that a child could have unknowingly eaten this and gotten very sick. 

Now to the good part. The property it self was breathtaking and has an old colonial charm to it. It was definitely quiet & peaceful so a big plus for this. Our room was quite specious and comfortable. We also had a small patio to ourselves. Pool maintenance definitely hasn't happened recently as the water had a slightly green tinge to it. So a word of caution before you take a dip.

Overall not too bad. But can definitely do better in terms of professionalism and a bit of kindness here and there. After all that's what sri lankan hospitality is all about yes?","Not bad.

(March 2021). Let me start with the pros
- We arrived at 1 pm and the team was kind enough to offer a late check out the next day, free of charge. 
- You cannot fault the Sri Lankan breakfast. The hoppers, roti, string hoppers - they were all excellent. 
- The pool is large and it’s the perfect setting that gives you privacy and if you’re lucky you can catch a peacock wandering around along with some monkeys. 
- they did not inform us that there would be no alcohol as their license was not renewed but they made an effort to find a tuk guy who purchased a few beers for us. 
Cons 
- The place looked run down in comparison to last year which was very sad to see. The bar area - which was shut was not at all clean with stains on their lovely white seating. It leads down to the pool so even with the bar shut it’s a nice area to enjoy a cup of tea or a game of cards. 
- It was near impossible to get someone from the team to assist. They were almost invisible during our stay. We had to walk into their office to ask someone to come and take an order. This slowly turned out to be quite irritating since none of the staff were in sight. 
- Last year their menu was great. Unfortunately this time, they barely had any of their items. None of their pizzas were available, no burgers etc. We were on full board (and the set menu was not too great) but we had no problem paying and ordering via the ala carte menu. We decided to skip dinner and head to the fort. 
- The desserts were actually rather bad and the bread buns were stale. 
All in all, I understand due to the pandemic they might be cost cutting / staff not turning up to work etc but it was quite sad to notice such a drastic change within that year. Hope it picks up!

This Colonial style boutique hotel (only 13 rooms) is a throwback to yesteryear. Rooms are huge with high ceilings. Beds are comfortable.  The bathrooms feature open air showers. Most rooms are ground floor, accessible from a beautifully manicured common courtyard. There is AC, but it is not effective unless the fan is on high due to the cathedral ceilings.  The property IS picture perfect and it is close to the massive and well preserved (former) Dutch fort that dominates Galle Old Town.  Looks, sadly, are where the impressive nature of this hotel stops.  Service is atrocious: plan on extra time at breakfast just for the staff to figure out your order. The food is mediocre at best.  Checkout is a disaster. If you need questions answered, forget about finding reliable assistance. If you are looking for long term comfort and convenience, this should not be your stay.

Food was mediocre, so we only ate breakfast, which was included. And a lunch when we arrived, which was very bland and tasteless. So much better food in Galle.
Another point for which the hotels loses a star is that on arrival, we were having lunch and somebody decided to burn trash just outside of the hotel, filling the hotel with horrible smoke in the middle of the day… This pile of trash burned until the next day making the air unpleasant for such a supposedly relaxing place.

The rooms were most special feature. They are generous in proportion and well appointed. The pool is also perfect. However, given the price you pay there is certainly room for improvement. It is outside the Galle Fort, the main tourist area, so it is not in a prime location. The breakfasts are wonderful but costly. The dinners, particularly the Western food, was not up to the standard we had at other hotels. The service was good but not great. The spa was absolutely terrible. I was not expecting the worst massage I have ever had from a masseuse who is clearly an untrained masseuse. I was terribly disappointed in their lack of driver accommodation. Most hotels of this price will include driver accomodation but we were required to pay an additional fee for him to stay offsite and there were restrictions on the times when he could have his meals. I appreciate what this hotel is trying to achieve, but it is certainly overpriced for what it offers.","An overpriced beauty","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1477843-r565710376-Tamarind_Hill_by_Asia_Leisure-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly, these comments are made in light of the fact that this is not a cheap place to stay in February with prices around US$300 per night by the time service charges and taxes are taken into account. To put this in context there are some fantastic hotels in Sydney, London, Paris New York etc etc where for this amount of money you can stay in a fabulous hotel.

The positives are the buildings, the pool area, the rooms and the generally relaxing nature of the place. With abundant wildlife in the immediate surrounds you can enjoy breakfast with wild peacocks, monkeys, squirrels and all sorts of bird life. There are numerous staff and they do their best to help. 

Herein lies the issue – no amount of staff make up for a lack of training and none of the staff appear to have any idea about the food and drinks they are serving to their customers nor the expectations the guests might expect - this is where Tamarind Hill misses the point. Some examples to explain
•	At our first breakfast we were presented with the breakfast menu. My wife went to order the Sri Lankan breakfast only to be told that she couldn’t have this because she hadn’t ordered it the night before. We told the waiter that no one had explained this when we checked in the day before but there was nothing to be done and no Sri Lankan breakfast was available and he said very sorry but not his fault……….. There was no note in the room or the guest info book to advise you of this either.
•	The western breakfast offers a pastry basket – management needs to look up in a dictionary the definition of “a pastry basket” as clearly they have no idea. A few slices of untoasted white sliced bread with some strange bits of puff pastry 
•	On our first night we ordered a gin and tonic at the bar. The local tonic was woeful – more like mouthwash than tonic – I asked if they had other tonics like schweppes tonic and the bar man said no. We were therefore somewhat surprised to find that in our mini bar there were 2 cans of schweppes tonic so the next day I questioned the bar man on this and his response was that there were 2 different companies involved and he could not sell Schweppes tonic regardless of the fact that the tonic he did serve ruined the drink it was designed to go with. Management have got a serious problem with this sort of thinking…
•	The amenities in the rooms were great and shower gel and shampoo came in quaint triangular shaped porcelain bottles. However if you don’t replace / refill the bottles then they run out. Surely this is a basic task for the room service crew every day – but not at Tamarind Hill
•	The towels in the rooms were once white. They are now an off white / grey colour. Ours always appeared to look like they needed to be washed again. I get that keeping towels white may be difficult but wouldn’t it make sense to use a different colour and create the appearance at least of the rooms having nice clean fresh towels – it’s the little things that leave a lasting impression – Again one day they cleaned the room and only replaced one bath towel. It’s just not that hard to replace two bath towels and two hand towels every day and make sure this happens – but it is apparently at Tamarind Hill 
•	Likewise the table cloths which had seen too many red wine spills and needed to be replaced
Tamarind Hill seems unsure of its target market. The lunch / dinner / room service menu is really disappointing and as a result other than for breakfast, the only time we ate there was on our last night before heading to the airport. We found it strange that there were more Thai items on the menu than Sri Lankan food. The menu had pasta, pizza, burgers that I just don’t understand why you would serve up such fare when the local food is so abundantly available and more pleasant. By all means have a few western sidelines but at least have a core local menu. The chicken burger came with a processed pattie – why oh why would you do that when chicken is abundantly and cheaply available? If you wanted a red wine, I’m not sure of how all of the wines were cellared however it always concerns me in hot countries to see bottles of red wine standing around in displays on shelves – just how off will these be by the time they get to the glass?
Tamarind Hill should send someone over to the Sun House in Galle to have a look at what they could achieve and how they could present a menu. The food there was magnificent as was the service and they wisely offered two options when it came to tonic – the local version or with schweppes at a premium price. The bar man told me that he didn’t sell much local toinc. No surprises there. 

Tamarind Hill is a fabulous place ruined by the lack of investment by management in staff training and in presenting fare that is worthy of the price tag of the hotel. Given the abundance of alternatives available you would do well to check out other places than be underwhelmed by the overall offering available here. If you stay here go out for your meals and bring your own tonic. The Sun House in Galle has a similar ambiance, facilities, is around the same price but knows what it is doing.
We get that none of the staff have likely ever drunk a gin and tonic, drink red wine, eaten much western food and therefore they have little or no idea about what they are serving. Having said that there was never anyone from management or who appeared to be from management to oversee the staff, to coach, mentor and train the staff. What the place needs is a good hotel/restaurant consultant to do a Tamarind Hill make over and turn it into what it could so easily be, which is a fabulous place to stay with a great menu and drinks list.","A jem in Galle - Slightly flawed though","2018-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1477843-r564471066-Tamarind_Hill_by_Asia_Leisure-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Never really paid too much attention to the quality of the bed before because generally find that hotel beds are pretty decent, however here we noticed and unfo not for its quality, but lack of same.

We had dinner and breakfast there, but what a disappointment, mushrooms out of a can, vanilla ice cream that has never been near real vanilla, bread which looked and had a texture like it was from the day before. Overall just a complete lack of freshness from the kitchen

On arrival there appeared to be a wedding going on but it turned out it was a photo shoot. The whole experience of check in and then lunch was spoilt by a crew of photographers/models. It is such a small hotel you couldnt miss them and first impressions count.

Hotel itself is very pretty with large rooms that could do with a little bit of a tidy up. It was clean but silly things like curtain hold back was hanging off, weeds in little outdoor area. 
Food was ok . Another thing that needs to be addressed which was mentioned by other guests is the lack of service at the outside bar area. You could wait 30 minutes just to be served , in the end we found it best to go and find them. Two nights we were there we had very loud music coming from what i assume is the neighbouring area which i know is out of the hotels control but be aware you are right next to a local village.
Pool area is small but very nice with wildlife all around. Peacocks, monkeys and rabbits were frequent visitors.

Good: Nice greeting with towel and spice tea. The best informative check-in we had at any hotel. You'll find cute bunny rabbits all over the place. The hotel is beautiful and small - only 12 rooms so quite intimate. The pool was pretty, long and narrow. 

The room was huge and very nicely furnished. There were mandarin oranges on the table and later they brought us delicious coconut macaroons. There was AC, ceiling fan, TV, kettle, water, coffee & tea station. Room 3 had a gorgeous comfortable king bed and a small single bed to one side. The bathroom was very big and comfortable. There are decorative vents over each of the two windows that could not be closed off which lets in 'the weather'. There was a ceiling fan, nice toiletries, hair dryer, towel rack. It's one of the better 'outdoor' bathrooms we've had as there at least was a ceiling fan to move the heavy, humid air. 

There was a small onsite spa where I had a very good pedicure the afternoon we arrived. 

We found the al la carte dinner menu a bit pricey but the food and service were good. The included breakfast was served al la carte and was very nice with very good service. 

Two front desk people came by to inquire during our stay so we had opportunity to complain about the noise and AC (see below).               

Poor: We were woken up at 2am by men talking loudly - thought it was coming through the bathroom window from behind the property but was actually coming from the hotel courtyard. When I opened the door there were a dozen casually dressed young men sitting in the open bar area right in-front of room 4 next door. When I asked if they were guests here (as at dinner time there were only 3 foreign couples including us) one of the men came over - and I saw it was one of the dinner waiters - and said they were having a birthday party for someone that checked in late!  With his reassurance that they would be quiet, the noise continued with talking and dishes and cutlery clanging about until 3am. That's not a 5 * experience in my book. There are at least three other areas where they could have sat and not disturbed us in the middle of the night - why sit in-front of occupied rooms? 

Other not so nice things: Some of the bed linens and towels were worn or frayed with holes. Directly behind room 3's private courtyard was a huge cell phone tower which ruined the pretty atmosphere. The room was very dark as the only natural light is from the french doors that open to the small private high-walled courtyard in the back. The room lighting was very low while ironically there is an opaque window design above the front door that let in early morning light just when you didn't need or want it. We found the area around the pool quite messy even with dog poo on a tile between the pool and the shower. The in-room wifi was weak. The AC unit didn't work very well - it blew air but didn't cool very good. On the second day (by our request) someone came in and fixed the AC unit and afterwards it functioned well. At checkout when paying by credit card  an additional 5.3% is collected by the 'merchant's service provider' which is ridiculous - if charged at all is usually 2.2%.","Good but not great","2015-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1477843-r431287879-Tamarind_Hill_by_Asia_Leisure-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We felt the hotel had such potential, it really needs some love. 
The pool furniture (cushions and towels) are old and need replacing. The pool is exqisuite though, leading into the jungle where you can swim and watch monkeys in the trees. 

The 12 rooms are lovely, with a large bathroom and doors leading into your own private garden. The courtyard is beautiful but again, felt almost eerie, and abandoned. There was a large pot plant in the centre filled with empty wine bottles, used as a dustbin. 

All in all, if the hotel management focus on getting the atmosphere right and give this little gem some love, it would have been a different experience.

Thank you for your review. Tamarind Hill is a small hotel with 10 deluxe rooms located on the ground floor and 2 suites located on the upper floor. You are very correct our hotel does not offer ocean views as we are an inland hotel bordering a river. The ocean is a few minutes away. The popular Unawatuna beach is also located stone throws away by vehicle. We are glad you enjoyed the rabbits and peacock at the property of which the latter is free range.

The property itself was very gorgeous, quaint, lovely and had a lot of potential to be great but lacked tremendously in character and service.  Our children loved the pool, fish pond and the rabbits on the property so that kept them entertained during our stay.  The food at the restaurant was very good, especially the traditional Sri Lankan food.  

The main thing that was bothersome and irritating were the number of flies on the property, restaurant and in our room.  It took away from any charm or comfort that we had hoped for.....  In my opinion, the property was lacking good management.  During our entire stay, it appeared as though staff were around but were doing their own thing and we were left to do our own thing so it felt as if we were neglected.  The whole property and experience felt too quiet, lonely and deserted.  If you are looking for a hideaway retreat and not to be bothered by anyone type of experience, then this is the place for you.  If you are looking for a little pampering, liveliness and character, I would consider other options.  If management would be interested, I would gladly give my feedback on how this property could be on par with 4 and 5 star hotels.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for taking the time to discuss this matter over the phone with me the other day. Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused during your recent stay.  

As discussed on the phone with you, I have instructed my Reservations team to inform the Chef to have String hoppers made for you specially every time you stay with us. We take that extra step to customize and personalize guests’ requests every time but, on this occasion, we have failed, and I have advised the team to ensure this is available every time you stay with us. We have a rotating menu every day of the week and as discussed, I am sure you will experience it next time.   

I have also mentioned to the roof top Ward7 retro-bar team, if food is ordered from the ground floor 57 restaurant to the roof top ward 7 retro-bar, to indicate how long it will take to the guest due to logistical reasons. I have also discussed with the F&B Manager looking at the design of serving dishes when food is ordered from the ground floor restaurant to the roof top retro-bar. 

Due to our sustainable practices, we do only serve Sri Lankan fruits, and I have also shared your concern and ensured that we have a minimum of 5 varieties of fruits available at the breakfast buffet. 

As we spoke, I hope this one-time incident will not keep you away, we look forward to welcoming you back to Jetwing Colombo Seven again. 

Ayubowan (May you live long)!

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

Thank you for your wonderful comments about the location, quality of food and the professionalism of staff. 

We also thank you for your wonderful comments about Ishini and the team. I will be sure to let them know. 

As per the tele-conversation we had a while ago and as explained, unfortunately we don't let any food out of the hotel after events due to food safety measures and procedures. Our hotel is approved by the ISO 22000 food safety management standards and as per ISO 22000, we have strict guidelines to follow to ensure the food we served is to its highest standards. Further as we are HACCP (Hazard analysis and critical control point) certified there are certain strict guidelines, to be followed with regard to food safety procedures. I would also like to thank you for understanding the above factors during our call.  

Once again we look forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven.

However, we were disappointed with the hotel’s response when we requested take-away packs for the unconsumed food. We were informed that this was against hotel policy, which we found surprising, especially given Jetwing Group’s commitment to sustainability. Jetwing has established itself as an industry leader in community service, sustainability, waste reduction, and ethical practices, with Mr. Hiran Cooray setting a notable example in these areas. In this context, the stance taken by the hotel, particularly by Mr. Suni, who appeared indifferent to our suggestion, was unexpected and somewhat disappointing.","Good hotel","2024-09","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r973292070-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

I am confident, there are many overseas guests visiting Sri Lanka in seasons and off seasons exclusively to stay at Jet Wing Colombo Seven. There should be numerous local clients who use every negative and positive experience in demanding daily lives to rush to JWC7 purchasing its services from Cafe 57, checking in regularly over the past many years, purchasing customized cakes for various occasions, giving gifts of honey-moon packages and what not.
 JWC7 roof top is very popular among local and foreign guests due to the amazing panoramic view. Whenever, I got to deliver a zoom lecture, I came to JWC7 because of the tranquility it offered.
I have been with JWC7 since 2021 when the country was grappling with the  Covid-19 pandemic and lock-downs. I fondly remember the date of 23rd June 2021, at the roof top of JWC7 seated near the pool on my own at midnight (none at all in the vicinity) after celebrating the unexpected failure of my trainee with a bottle of wine. I stayed at JWC7 continuously since then to guide my trainee for success, now she is receiving overseas training in Canada. My trainee became a winner amidst all odds.
Mr Ajantha Perera was very helpful and provided a valuable, customized service for me at that time. I guess he is overburdened with providing such services and now he is fed up
On the 10th of December 2023 a heavenly event was held at Barnes, JWC7 to felicitate my long-term buddy Dr Poojitha Wickramaratne, Consultant in Restorative Dentistry. I have had a bottle of sparkling wine from the hotel and danced for 3-hours at a stretch as I did consider JWC7 as 'My better home'. I stayed in 1106 but got to leave at 8 am to attend to my responsibilities and duties.
My recent encounter with JWC7 was hosting a lunch at Cafe 57 for a senior Nursing Officer, few Health Assistants and two children of one of them. This was the 4th Visit to JWC7 by my Health Assistant Mrs. Manjula Senani. She was delighted to accompany her 2 young sons for the lunch. I settled the invoice in full 5-days before the event and I am sure, JWC7 has more faithful clients than me. Cafe 57 was full of highly satisfied overseas guests and some of them of were Sri Lankan origin.","Walking Down the Memory Lane with JWC7","2023-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r930892330-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. We thank you for taking the time to write an review.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused at your early arrival. The hotel operates on international standards of check in and check out times. Hence the check in time is 1400hrs. 

On that day the hotel was running full occupancy the previous night. Due to this factor rooms were not available at your time of arrival. We always encourage our guests to book from the previous night if you have an early arrival flight. This way  you will have the room as soon as you arrive to the hotel.
 
Due to the increase in occupancy in Colombo and hotels running nearly full all the time it is always advisable to book from the previous night specially if you are having a long flight and arriving early. Also since most guests departing flights are in the evening or late evening our guests check out at the intranational standard check out time which is 1200 noon. 

Once again our sincere apologies for the inconvenience and looking forward to welcoming you to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

We arrived very late and were checked in efficiently but was asked by other guests if the WiFi was working, this was an indicator as to how poor the internet service was .! 
Apparently, due to connections, we had been given a free upgrade for our room, I wouldn’t like to see a lesser room if that’s the case. No balcony and no opening window. The Aircon is constantly on even when card for power is removed. 
Don’t get me wrong the room was fine, but rather bland in decoration. Bathroom was good size and well equipped. The cleaner was super efficient and very friendly. 
I just think the whole place could do with a deep clean and a re paint in places. The windows hadn’t seen a cleaner for quite some time. Grime had gathered in the corners on the communal landing carpet.
I complained on a few occasions about the WiFi service, it is very poor and I tried to explain that business users would be very annoyed at the speeds.. throughout our stay the best we got was 6mbps which in todays standards is appalling. 

Now to the pool… whilst on initial visit it looks impressive with a super view of the city, I was alarmed at the lack of health and safety around the pool. Basically, it’s an infinite pool without any security barrier to prevent certain death should you fall. I definitely wouldn’t allow children to play towards the front edge. 
The limited glass balustrade fitted is woefully inadequate and on the floor below one panel was shattered. The lounging are around the pool is nice but a little cluttered. 
The rooftop bar is very nice offers a great view over the city. Food was very good. 
Breakfast was ok but could be hotter in temp, typically, everything was only aired. Staff were lovely. 
The lifts can be frustrating at busy times.

We initiated out holiday in Sri Lanka, with a two day stay on the Jetwing. Lets start with the good things:
Hotel is more or less as advertised, rooftop infinity pool is nice, food is quite okay despite a bit of a shaky wine menu, rooms are clean and modern looking, and staff was generally helpful.

We saw quite a few drawbacks about the hotel we would like to highlight though to future customers: 
Our impression was that it was all about money. We paid 75 dollars (110% of our room rate) for early check-in at 5AM, instead of the usual 2PM. The hotel argued it was because of a fully booked hotel, with only the handicap room available, but to me it doesn't seem like it would make a difference. This unnaturally high early checkin fee, took us by surprise. Then trying to get local resturant tips from non other than the general manager was useless and annoying. No matter how much we tried to insinuate, we wanted to go out, her only obsession was go to the hotel resturant, matching the first impression of trying to get us to use as much money as possible at the hotel.

Rooftop and resturant is nice, but also a few drawbacks here. For a pretty big hotel the total of 4 sunbeds (even though very cormfortable) is too little, and made this, otherwise nice pool deck, a pain to wait for to get sun. Also in the evening the resturant extends out to the pool deck, meaning if the resturant has a good night, you can forget about a relaxing night by the pool with the skyline in sight. Also only the nice directions are shown, and not the huge building next to the pool, making constant noise during the day (Feb 2020) 

So when should you choose this hotel? If it is the cheapest option of hotels with a decent standard (It does have a good standard, especially in the room), however if you want to relax by the pool more than once, you may not like it, and if you wan't to be close to the coast and tourist areas, I would recommend a hotel in that area instead. It was fine for us on this two day, not much pool action sightseeing days, but we were not impressed.","Hotel is nice enough, but with quite a few drawbacks","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r746892456-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

This property was our last day of the tour and finishing touch hasn't been great

Rooms and views were lovely,  rooms and bathroom were spotless. Toiletries were aromatic and I personally loved it.

Issue was with Dinner - we were on half board basis and were offered options to choose from set menu. The staff was not at all equipped to understand the order and deliver it right. There were only 1 soup, 1 main course and 1 dessert offered for dinner - too less for a 5 star. The order took forever to arrive with even some items being missed making us wait in the middle of the dinner. 

Desserts that was only icecream took another era to arrive and it was delivered to our room only when senior management intervened after my complained. The icecreams were melted - check the pic. I am sure it doesn't melt in 2 min lift to 10th floor.

I had ordered cake for my hubby's birthday and when I checked in I told them to deliver it in dinner time.  Before I went for dinner I made a reminder and cake was still not there. Post dinner we again sent reminder and were told it's on the way! 30 mins later I raised a complaint to the management and they got it delivered to our room after our entire mood was spoilt!
I wanted to have a black coffee after waking up next day but there were no sachets the staff arrived but did not have only coffee sachets..it was with cream. Staff could provide no help then 

Breakfast was alright with taste the next day.","Totally disappointed ","2020-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r745651274-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Many things near by and easy access to many places in Colombo. The hotel is well kept
And clean and the rooms are quite large and well designed. 

The only area that needs improvement is the staff, not all of them speak English which makes it hard to request or explain something. There service is a bit slow and doesn’t match a 4-5star hotel service. They are trying but probably need more training. Eg housekeeping - my quilt cover on the day of check in had stains and
Glasses in the bathroom weren’t cleaned. I asked for the glasses to be cleaned but weren’t cleaned for the entire stay. Towels were sometimes not replaced and needed to be asked for. 

The infinity pool is gorgeous and the spa is good too. I would stay here again if staying in the same area.

The hotel reception could be a little friendlier but were professional. 

The pool area is the big selling point of this hotel and it does not disappoint but must say it is a little short on sun loungers especially when big groups arrive. 

Unfortunately there was a large group of Chinese travellers on our floor and they did not seem to have much regard for making too much noise. We moved room to try and get away from this. 

The main reason I am not giving this place more then 3 stars is that in my opinion the breakfast and rooms were not up to standard. The bathroom we had smelled really bad from the drainage pipes and even after the staff cleaning it the smell came back shortly afterwards. 

The gym was not as good as I had hoped but I guess that was because I had high expectations

Service over the stay wasn't great unfortunately. While the staff opening the door of the car were welcoming, on check in the reception was slow and unwelcoming.

On check-out we had called the reception for the bell boy but they had forgotten, we had to tell them again.

The actual property was good, the studio had a washer/dryer which helped us with laundry, and the room had international sockets built it. Location wise, it was a good point to visit the city attractions from and, if you are up to it, in walking distance to many things.

On a side-note, the new years eve rate was incredibly hiked, we'd assumed this paid for a dinner or something like in other parts of the world but we didn't find anything extra to justify the hike.

Despite our commitment to exceed the expectations of our valued guests, we have not been able to meet your expectations and your comment has drawn our serious attention. We are looking into what prevented us from letting you have access to the many brochures and information available on the area. We value the comments of our guests and make them an opportunity in our constant efforts to improve further. Thank you for your comments and we look forward to a second opportunity to render a better service.

Couple of weeks back our friends stayed at this hotel with their 2 kids and they recommended because they were looked after nicely.

 However the lady who met us greeted with a doubt (maybe because they don't get guests who don't come without a booking), we requested some more details, what there is to do around and to see a room before making a choice, they didn't refuse but it seemed that she was irritated. They didn't give us information and we were straight seated, served a nice drink, and kept waiting. Few issue took place

1. While we're waiting I approached the reception staff and started to ask details to purchase some fuel if the hotel had (initially the lady said they didn't have fuel in the hotel) I asked for assistance to go to town to refuel. The answers I got was a flat out No! even the guy at the reception cut into the conversation and gave me an answer saying we don't have drivers at the hotel (first time I heard this). No! No! No! Was the only answer I got and it was frustrating, My patience ran out and I directly asked for the manager, who apparently was the guy in the reception. I called him to my side and told him I was a diplomat in the Indian embassy. I wanted my vehicle to be refueled and repeated my request for help.

2 It was surprising to see how they changed, the guy even said he would check the stores and see how much fuel the have (minutes before they said they didn't have any) it was after I said I was a diplomat that this guy offered help. 

3. we decided to see the lunch menu before seeing the room and the lobby manager took the order. 

But Over all the good triumphs. 
The area is peaceful The room was comfortable and value for what we paid, it was nice to sit in the pool in the evening with the wind and drinking cocktails. Some staff were friendly and professional. The reception was also more friendlier. food was tasty, lunch Fish and chips were good. Dinner We chose Naan, chicken. Breakfast was also good. 
l. 
The next day we visited the park which was also good. I requested the reception guy to assist me to the town for fuel, it seemed he didn't want to but in the end he did accompany me around town. 

Few things I Want to say that the hotel should have 
1. I don't know any names of staff because they don't have name tags. Every hotels have staff wittheir name tags. 
2. Their is no feedback form to fill out. Normally there is a book or a card or even a email. I didn't receive or see any thing. Making me wonder if this is not there to avoid such feedback as mine. 

There are good in the hotel. The hotel is a bit far. Helping matters from the start.","New year ups and downs.","2022-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r874794391-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The journey itself was scenic and exciting, especially for the kids who enjoyed every bit of the ride.  When we got there, we were cordially welcomed in a way that was typical of Tamil culture. This was something we really liked.

 The Passi Bay Suite was very big and great for a family.  The kids adored that the suite had its own sauna and hot tub.  The hotel has a really serene ambiance. It really is a calm bay, which is great for families who want to relax and spend time together.

 The cuisine, on the other hand, wasn't quite what we expected.  The buffet was okay, but it didn't have enough choices and the food didn't taste as good as we had hoped.  The à la carte menu was again okay but taste could have improved more. We think it might have been because it was the off-season, so we know that dispersion is limited.

 Even so, the personnel were kind and helpful, which made our stay more comfortable.  The people in the area were really friendly and welcoming, and we departed with great recollections of the Tamil culture.

 Overall, it was an okay experience, taking into account the distance we went and how much the suite cost.  We still think this resort is worth a visit, especially for people who want peace and quiet on Sri Lanka's east coast.

The room I stayed did not have A/C. When we informed 11pm also they were working on it. My 75year old mother and I wanted to have a wash and go to bed since we had a very busy and tiring day, as well the following day we had to leave early. We were very tired and after midnight we had to pack bags and move to a garden villa which they said was an upgraded room. The new room standards of the bathroom sink, taps, shower areas were worse than the room we stayed in. Some places just need a little scrubbing with a brush. Also my bedside light did not work.

The HK supervisor should check all areas of the room before releasing rooms for the front office.Don't they, as a standard practice ?
Having issues with two rooms it clearly shows that the HK do not do their job properly.

There were no proper apology for room moving. It looks like this is very common to the staff. 
It was a very disappointing experience. 

There was a trainee boy at the reception and welcome would have been much warmer with a little smile on the face. Check-out was no different . 
Bell boys were very helpful on both arrival and departure.

Restaurant food taste was 7/10 comparison to similar hotels in SL.I asked a chef about gluten free options and he did't know how to answer straight away.

The dinner buffet had a lack of food diversity and selection, and the pool bar kept forgetting our orders for food and drink.

-жуткая жара в ресторане, жарче чем на улице, кондиционеры совершенно не работают. Сотрудники открывают двери, но это мало помогает, после приема пищи выходишь мокрый до нитки. 
- очень скудные завтраки. Каждый день рыбный/куриный карри, яйца, сыр лежит почти расплавленный из за жары, страшная колбаса, кофе растворимый. Варёный за деньги. Из фруктов папая, арбуз. Есть крупная надпись ""ваша оплата не включает еду на вынос"". Любопытно, что там можно вынести.... Наверно карри в карман перелить

- слабая уборка номеров. Песок в душевой остаётся лежать после уборки
- отсутствие устройств для мытья ног на выходе с пляжа

Reportedly, the driver accommodation is not good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The calm resort and spa is located on the gorgeous and immaculately clean Kalkudah beach. One of the big benefits is that the sea is very calm in this bay and it’s possible to swim, without being knocked about by the waves. 

The grounds are lush and the rooms are extremely spacious and absolutely spotless, but unfortunately the mattresses are soft and appear fairly worn. Staff are very friendly and accommodating as well. Overall, this hotel has the potential to offer a perfect holiday, but sadly there are some deficiencies that spoil the experience somewhat. 

I had reserved a room with twin beds, but they gave us a double bed instead and while they immediately sought to
rectify the situation, it took a good 25 minutes to do so. Really nothing to complain about, but it was only
one of several small incidents. The service in the restaurant was not particularly great, the wine list was terribly uninspiring and the only white wine available by the glass was virtually undrinkable. The food was tasty overall and the breakfast spread rather impressive and the mainly Russian patrons certainly made the most of it.  They also had a rather good Sri Lankan filter coffee and they kindly made us a coffee at 6 pm, while we were waiting for our room to be prepared.

But the really big issue was the treatment of our lovely driver. He had to wait almost 5 hours for his room (which apparently was sub-standard, when he finally had it)  and didn’t receive his dinner, so that he had to seek sustenance elsewhere. The drivers work so hard, especially these days, where they have to waste so much time and energy securing fuel for their vehicles and are exhausted after a day’s driving. As this is really unacceptable,  I can recommend this hotel only to guests, who are not coming with a driver.","Calm and comfortable","2022-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r848833741-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

This is a simple (rather soulless) hotel with few facilities (small pool, gym and a spa) but located on a great beach.
We were upgraded to a Garden Room which was spacious and modern although not without faults - broken plug in the bathroom sink, broken fridge and broken TV (fridge repaired and TV changed quickly though). Frustratingly nesting pigeons in the roof space made for an unwelcome alarm call every morning and none of the wardrobe doors or drawers would close properly (drawers would automatically extend when clothes were placed in them). Rainfall shower was good!
Another positive is the food provided at the evening buffet - good quality with a range of Sri Lankan and western choices, although did get a little monotonous after a week. We noticed that the standard of food and service dropped when staff were pandering to corporate guests that were staying at the hotel. Drinks service provided in restaurant and bar was patchy at best with most wines on the wine list being out of stock. Sometimes you had finished your meal before drinks arrived. Breakfast buffet was OK but there is no fresh coffee - just self serve sachets of Nescafe and a hot water urn.
Evenings were strange as every one seemed to disappear after dinner - entertainment was limited to a singing guitarist (with limited repatoire) although a big screen was set up for a couple of the world cup matches. More effort was made for corporate group bookings.
During the day, the biggest frustration was trying to secure towels and cushions for sunbeds. Whilst there were plenty of sunbeds, we often had to wait for laundered towels to arrive and the hotel only has 30 cushions to cater for all guests! During out 8 day stay a drinks service around pool/beach was only offered once and even then the barman returned after 45 minutes to confirm items out of stock.
To break up the monotony of the lunchtime food offering we decided to order a 'promotional Thali' for the last day - to be ordered a day in advance. Unfortunately when we arrived for lunch we were informed that due to a group arriving at the hotel, a Thali couldn't be provided so ended up spending 6,000 rupees on yet another buffet.
This hotel has potential with a few small improvements - provide a drinks service around the pool/beach (rather than staff members sitting around in groups watching tv and playing on their phones), provide a tea/coffee service at breakfast, spend a little money on snagging in the rooms and injecting some character in the communal areas and providing enough towels and cushions for the sunloungers.","Disappointing but has potential","2018-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r598410509-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

We decided to upgrade to all inclusive from half board as we knew we wouldn't be leaving the grounds. There are no shops/bars/restaurants within walking distance and to be honest we just wanted to relax & do nothing. We were advised that as we were now all inclusive our minibar would be stocked with beer and soft drinks-this never materialised despite asking daily until we left. It would have been better to say nothing as we would have been none the wiser. 

We were shown to our bungalow which was stunning-fabulous aircon and a sitting are with the pool literally 10 steps from our patio! The room was kept spotlessly clean although when we left empty bottles/glasses outside the door for collection they were left there for over 24 hours. Also there was no consistency to the toiletries that were left each day. 1 day it was shower gel & shampoo, the next day shampoo & body lotion (even though we'd used the previous days) so we had to ask for more. 

The food was amazing and the executive chef spoke to us at every meal ensuring that we were happy with selection. 2 things however let the breakfast buffet down I believe- there was only 1 brand of milk (Unsure of fat content) and 1day there was cereal and orange juice and the next day none. I did question this and was told they liked to vary the menu. I pointed out that they had toast/croissant/cheese etc every morning but not this. I was also told Sri Lankan's don't usually eat cereal so I suggested that they begin to include it every day for non-Sri lankans. You can ask for it, which I did so watch this space......

The second complaint I had, which I also discussed with the food & beverage manager was a complete absence of diet soft drinks. Not everyone wants to drink alcohol (or water) all day and when my husband asked for a cola light was told they didn't have any? 

I am diabetic which I pointed out so couldn't drink normal or full sugar equivalent. The beverages manager came to see me and said that they would try to get some by that evening or early the next day. Within an hour he came to tell me that they now had a stock of Pepsi max for me (? Just me). Over the course of the next few days almost every waiter asked me if I wanted a Pepsi max which left me a bit paranoid to be honest. They didn't seem to understand the importance of having low sugar alternatives of ALL their soft drinks, not just one variety and not just for me. 
However I was impressed with the speed my raised concern was dealt with so I would like to thank you for that. 

There was one restaurant manager (small, slim with dark hair-no name badge) who seemed to take offence at my complaint and didn't make eye contact with us for the remainder of our stay-I would suggest some customer service training! 

It sounds like I've been having a good rant but these are very minor details that could be rectified so easily and would ensure an much improved stay. 

The resort & grounds were one of the best we have ever stayed at and we left feeling completely re-charged so I would like to thank you so much. It just seems that service needs a little more tweaking to bring it up to the standard of the other 2 hotels we stayed at. 5 star surroundings with 3 star service.

Nice enough, the stretch of beach around the bay is quite wide and very exposed in the hot sun. No beach chairs or sun shades are provided here so prepare to roast. There are a number of hotels along the bay. 
You walk out of the hotel to the pool which is fine.  Again, insufficient poolside loungers and shades. The poolside is surrounded by grass, beware if you have kids. Some kind of weed has taken over and it's like walking on thistles. I walked 10 feet on bare feet and then hopped back quickly to remove a load of fine needles. It's quite bizarre.  They had a bunch of local women who toiled for hours in baking heat to pull this stuff out but it was akin to painting the forth bridge. I don't really get why this is not a priority to sort.
Rooms are nice, comfortable, nice bedding. Our room had a TV which you could only watch by sitting on a small and not particularly comfortable 2 seater sofa. I think you should always be able to watch a TV from the bed if you are going to use it, which we didn't.  The shame about the rooms were the pigeons and there are a lot of them. They fly up under the eaves and crap all over the balcony and rail. I had to ask to get it cleared up but it doesn't last long as you can imagine. Stay on the ground floor. Wouldn't be so bad if the native bird song was a bit more tropical but a bunch of Pigeons cooing and defecating outside the window I can live without.
Food was far from spectacular and overpriced in comparison and for the quality.  Buffet is the standard offering and just not that great. Beef was on the menu one night and it was just inedible. What you could chew was like an old boot but mainly it was gristle and fatty. I don't get why you would serve it at all because people just bin it and try and find a plate of something else so it wastes everyone's time. Dessert bar was horrible, a symphony of overused gelatin, quite vile.  Rice and curry had chunks of chicken bone I didn't know existed.   So to get a decent nosh at a reasonable price we had the fruit platter for breakfast which is great and the burger off the menu is ok. This is not to say you can't eat anything from the buffet, you can, but not that much is nice for the price of it. 
There is a gym with one of everything and some decent weights. It all worked.
There are a couple of tourist shops which were never open in the few days we were there.

Issues started with my bill.  A long and laborious tale. I was charged twice on different credit cards for different amounts which anywhere else would have taken 10 minutes to resolve. The Hotel failed to manage the issue which involved me having to make calls from the UK to chase. Emails were not responded to, agreements were not followed. It took a month after leaving there to finally get my money returned. 
In addition I left something personal to me in my room, only about £40 in value but it was found and the Hotel said they would return it and given the complete mess they made not much to ask.  Of course it never arrived. 

So, stay on ground floor, wear walking boots to get to the beach, skip the buffet, pay cash and it will be fine.","A nightmare","2017-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r525054969-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The room where we stayed had an outside sitting area and an outside private eating area -- which would have been fabulous except that the mosquitos were a killer. Herbal repellents do absolutely nothing for me and we had run out of DEET a few days earlier. So despite the anti-mosquito bracelets that they left, my ankles were swollen with bites the first night. Also the room, which was quite dark, had limited place to put suitcases (and we travel light) and no place to sit except the bed. There were no slippers and the shower was very slippery. The combination shower and toilet left no room for privacy if one wanted to shower and the other wanted to attend to other hygiene issues. As in all overseas hotels, the electric outlet problem is just that -- a problem and inadequate. Challenging to blow dry hair and forget about using a curling iron. The grounds were lovely, and became magical at night with the fairy lights. 
The breakfasts were fine and the lunch/dinner that we had was good. Nothing outstanding, but no complaints. My thing was avoiding the mosquitos at all costs, so we tried to spend little as possible time outside in the evening and all meals are outside.","Ok","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r740956474-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

However one tap in a wash basin was not in working order either. The big issue however was the height of the bed SO high that a padded stool was provided to clamber into bed...but why only one until we asked for another AND further more getting in and out of the bed swathed in a mosquito net was not easy or safe. Storage space was limited as was space to access suitcases. We were allocated a butler but he seemed too do little more than serve huge expensive meals we had no option but to take as we were. isolated from any other restaurants.

The main guest area is a fine example of colonial building.

Our stay was in the Pioneer room and it is specifically this that made our stay a problem.  The room is an annex to the main building, linked by a  building with washrooms for hotel guests to use while outside.  The room itself is quite pleasant and has a spacious toilet/shower area.  In the evenings some guests, perhaps under pressure, see the doorway as another washroom door and enter or try to enter.  We were a bit careless with locking the door - it is a luxury hotel after all - and even had someone enter while we were in the room. We did complain to the hotel but even though I’m sure other guests would have had the same issue, I suspect nothing will be done.

Architecturally, Kandy House is a jewel and definitely worth a visit. The grounds and the building are well kept and the decor is tasteful and a joy to behold. The compound is just simply gorgeous with rooms built around a central courtyard. Individual rooms are aesthetically arranged and very comfortable. As indicated in other reviews, it is an oasis of calm after the mayhem of Kandy central. I strongly recommend checking Kandy House out to have a sense of gracious living in Sri Lanka. 

 I always maintain that a place is ever going to be as good as its management. Kandy House is run meticulously, rooms are orderly, clean and the food is good. However, everything seems mechanical and one gets the sense that the workers are just employees - not something one would expect in a boutique hotel. There are no personal touches in Kandy House - you might as well be staying in a 4 star chain.

The manager sanjaya has a lot to learn about the hospitality industry. He is still young and will have time to learn that one trait you don't want to communicate in hospitality is cockiness. However, the place is efficiently run but we get that in other 5 star joints.

In a boutique hotel, we are looking for a sense of home - and this we didn't find in Kandy House and this is one reason why we will not be returning  - pity - as the compound itself is beautiful. 

as for the personal butler - it is just a gimmick. the place is so small and compact, one doesn't need a butler. Other gripes - dodgy unstable wifi and hot water that runs out after 3 minutes. The bath tubs may be the centre piece in some rooms but it wasn't comfortable as there was not enough hot water to run a warm bath. The devil is in the details - and when you look closely, Kandy House doesn't measure up,

But it also has a few weaknesses.

We were in the 'Black Rajah' room, which is full of colonial charm on first inspection but it has a few issues which I imagine extend to other lower floor rooms.  

Firstly, the bathroom design is quirky but impractical.  If you're traveling as a couple, make sure you're comfortable in eachother's skin because in the absence of a door and with the toilet about 5 metres from the bed ... Nothing is left to the imagination.  Oh, and remember the concrete bath in the centre of the room if you have to get up in the middle of the night to use that toilet.

If you're tall, like me at 6ft2, make sure you wear a hat everywhere, because you're going to be banging your head.  A lot.  

And if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.  The design is such that only a very thin, wooden door with lots of cracks separates you from the courtyard where staff run around after the dinner service so if you're looking for an early night, that's probably not going to work out for you.

The setting though is gorgeous - a peaceful manor in the Kandy hillside suburbs that feels like something out of the Jungle Book complete with superb infinity pool.

The staff are friendly but often you have to search around to find someone if you need something.  We saw the manager on check-in but not again during our two day stay.

And the food in the restaurant is inconsistent.  On one day we were the only couple around but it took 40 minutes for the kitchen to deliver two simple cocktails.  That night the food was very forgettable - including a dessert where the milk had been heated too much and it had curdled.  But on the next night the food was superb and the following morning's breakfast could not have been delivered more promptly.

All in all, a character-filled manor in a beautiful jungle setting but some quirks that won't suit everyone and inconsistent food mean we'd rate it 3.5 if we had that option.

We had one of the so-called ultra rooms on the main floor.  Our suite was quite charming with a stone tub in the bedroom and candles placed on it each evening.  We had two dinners at Kandy House.  The first was satisfactory but not noteworthy.  The second, a curry dinner with about 9-10 dishes, was excellent.  I have no idea why the hotel seems to offer a very limited menu though.  It is possible they will prepare other dishes if you ask but that is not mentioned as you check-in or come to dinner.

We had what they call a private butler.  He did serve our meals and fetch a few things for us but appeared poorly suited for his job.  We would have preferred simply having other staff serving us as in other upscale boutique hotels in Sri Lanka.  Perhaps some guests are impressed having a private butler but for us this young fellow was below the service standards at other Sri Lankan hotels.

On checkout, we found a few ""errors"" on our bill.  The literature in our room indicated tea and cake in the afternoon are complimentary.  Yet it was included in a general expense line which one could only understand by asking a fellow I presume might be the manager to explain.  One morning we had tea in a sitting area about five meters from where we then had our breakfast (we were on their B&B plan so breakfast was included).  We were charged for tea in the sitting area also until we objected.  Last while we enjoyed cocktails in the garden my wife asked our butler if they had some nuts.  He brought some out and we were shocked to find the nuts also included in our bill.  The fellow told us they always charge for nuts - I guess ordering two cocktails does not warrant even nuts at Kandy House.  After our bill was corrected (yes the charge for the nuts was also removed with the fellow repeating several times that they always charge for nuts), we got up to leave.  The fellow did not even wish us a good journey or say he hoped we enjoyed our stay.  As this review shows, this episode left a bad impression.  The extra charges did not amount to much money but the attitude exhibited was poor.","Has Potential If Better Managed","2015-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r252547805-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

You relate how we would not let you cancel one night.It's probably worth mentioning that one week before your 3-night stay,although booked through an agent,you approached the hotel directly to cancel one of the nights.We have a clear cancellation policy and it's typically well understood especially in a key booking period for a small hotel,so we become very compromised if somebody cancels at very short notice.We hope you understand in the same way as a few previous guests in similar circumstances,and it has not coloured other parts of your review as well.

We are also sorry you were disappointed with the room.There's little we can do about that,as you saw many of the rooms are different and individually styled,as well as differently priced - for your stay of 3 nights with dinner on one of them,your billed average price was no more 240 pounds per night.We heard from your wife that you were happy with the room,but you were clearly less impressed with the food.Hopefully other reviews can be a broader reflection.

One further clarification is required as you mention it.We close down for the night as late as required,not any specific time.I understand the staff may have begun that process prematurely as all others had gone to bed and you were returning from dinner outside - that is our mistake for which we apologise,it should not usually happen.However,all spaces should have been made available to you on your return.I gather you went on to enjoy the remainder of the complimentary bottle of wine we had given to you on your first night,on the veranda of your room.

The positives: The tent accommodation was adequate and the food was very good - generous servings and everything was delicious - an impressive feat given the camp’s remoteness and total reliance on solar power. The staff are attentive and helpful, and the safari experience was all we could have hoped for. Special mention to Mr Solomon, the safari guide, for his excellent knowledge. Also to Roger for helping us with transportation. 

The negatives: The camp is situated a long way from the national park entrance (approx 40 minute drive).
Despite what the website says the wifi does not work. There was no hot water for a shower and the power frequently cut out for lengthy periods leaving the tent without a fan or light. 
The website is a little difficult to follow in relation to prices for safaris, jeep, guide and what is actually included with these listings. We did 2 half-day safaris (1 would have been enough ) and Mahoora told us the park entrance for 2 people would be US$50 but we were charged US$72. 

Recommendations: 1 half-day safari and 1 night stay is plenty.

We're truly sorry to hear that your stay was affected by the unseasonably wet weather, leading to the closure of Yala National Park.

We appreciate your recommendation regarding the seatbelts in the safari vehicles, and we assure you that safety is a top priority for us. We will address this concern promptly to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

We're glad you found the food quite good, although we apologize for any discomfort caused by the inquiry about the number of drinks during your meals. Your feedback is valuable, and we will review our communication processes to ensure a more seamless and guest-friendly experience.

The Yala national park was actually closed for flooding so we were lucky that Udawalawe was still open. 
The wet weather was no one’s fault but it made the tents very damp - the beds were damp and all our belongings became damp. We were refunded for a downgrade because one of the luxury tents was damaged, and we had no problem with that but it took a long while to dry out afterwards.
The food was quite good considering we were in a camp but we had all inclusive drinks and it was disturbing to be asked half way through the meal EXACTLY how many drinks we’d had! We didn’t drink much - 2 glasses of wine each and the measures were such that they wouldn’t have equated to 1 glass! It didn’t seem generous. Our consumption was then double checked in the morning - what was that all about?
On the plus side, we saw lots of elephants in the park and the drive was unhurried and enjoyable (as the rain stopped briefly!) I f we had one recommendation for the management it would be that the safari vehicles absolutely must have working seatbelts - simply because they are open vehicles and we hurtled along the main road for 30 mins to get to the national park. I think this should be addressed as a priority as it would be a legal requirement in many countries.","Mixed experience","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r936137967-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We paid for Elite and were promised the services of an experienced naturalist, but that did not happen. Instead we only had the guide from the park and  they were not
anywhere close to the level of  Mahoora’s one available naturalist (who was given to another couple!)

It is never good to be charged for something and not have it provided.  Its hard to say what the $ value of that is, but Mahoora is one of the most expensive 
safaris, so we did not expect this type of deficiency, and if it was to occur they perhaps could have found a way to compensate for it, but they did not.

The Safaris were hit and miss, and when they were successful it was more often because of the Mahoora jeep driver who was excellent, and not usually the 
guide supplied by the park (as I mentioned, the experienced naturalist was not offered to us.) The park guides often have a poor command of english and we usually could not understand their explanations so generally we didn’t converse much.  The 4x4 vehicle provided by Mahoora is very good. The meals on safari were not, I think, what one would expect for the price of a 1st class safari, especially the lunches, which we found quite meagre and spartan.  Dinner around the campfire was very atmospheric, and enjoyable, and well prepared, however no choices were offered (what you see is what you get!).

We paid in advance for Mahoora to provide a driver to bring us from Ella to their campsite. Their fee was considerably higher that market rates,
but we didn’t mind since we assumed they would provide a high calibre driver and vehicle for this long distance transfer. Well the driver was fine, but the car was
a jalopy, without any seatbelts in the back. When I pointed this out to the driver, he said, “don’t worry, I’m a good driver”. I found that to be unacceptable especially for the high fee we paid.  If Mahoora is not making any effort to verify the safety of their guests when arranging a transfer then it borders on negligence.  Once I pointed this out on arrival I believe they took it seriously, but for a supposedly first rate safari company, this should not have happened in the first place.

The accommodations are very good, (for a tented experience) and the staff at Mahoora are very friendly and helpful. 

Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but overpriced I think for the actual product that was provided in our case.","A generally good experience ","2019-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r650011805-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We are glad you enjoyed yourselves and made memories and had a lovely overall experience with us. Thank you for your suggestions on the improvements. It is much appreciated. However, we are concerned that you weren't happy about the level of English of the team at our campsite. Empowering underprivileged local communities is one of our values and some of the staff you have encountered have gained employment under this policy. English is not their mother tongue and they are a work in progress. We are really sorry that we did not meet your expectations in this area. Your naturalist and the manager on duty also had been Sri Lankans but with good English skills. In certain situations, when the accent is not clear, they would have made clarifications. We are sorry that this was perceived negatively.  
We take your comments on communication issues at the camp very seriously. The Camp Manager and Guest Relations Manager are strictly advised to do a detailed briefing about the camp and about the day's programme to our clients. Upon investigation it was identified that the Guest Questionaire has reached the campsite, however there was a miscommunication and we are deeply sorry, the pre-obtained guest questionnaire should have been followed. 
In terms of the location, we have located our camp at the very less populated eastern boundary of the park. It's an exclusive mini nature reserve. Most of our clients appreciate our location though it's a 30 minute drive away to the park entrance. As for the non-availability of a sign to the camp, it is because we have a designated meeting point from where we pick up our clients and bring them to the campsite. We advise all our clients to arrive at the meeting point and not the campsite as the road leading to the campsite is pretty rough and can be comfortably traveled in our 4x4 jeeps.

1.) English was a serious issue at the camp, throughout all employees, manager, and naturalist. I felt like I was rarely understood and typically had to repeat myself. I was very very surprised to stay at a place that cost this much and find this.

2) poor management. We never really had anything explained to us so found ourselves confused often and having to proactively track down management to ask questions.

3)  they don’t communicate with the corporate office. We spent months Dialoging with the corporate office (who speak great English) and they had us fill out a guest intake form of preferences. But none of those preferences or dietary restrictions were taken into account . Highly doubt they were ever received.

4) food was meh. Please let your cooks make us real Sri Lankan food on our Sri Lankan safari...

5) location is a bit far from the entrance in our thought.

6) there is no sign. Literally no sign and it’s on a back tiny road that you will never find. Add 45-60 min to your already long car ride trying to find it. This just bamboozles me. Please help me understand. 

Since the staff tried to please (when you approached them proactively) I feel like if the right manager was brought in these issues could be cleaned up.

My tent could also have been in better repair. Some comforts had to be sacrificed by ""camping,"" but there was no need for a tent in that area.There were MANY buildings in which to stay much closer to the action.

Given the bizarre location, I consider it a bit overpriced.","Great safari, but way far from the park","2016-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r422288264-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We also found the stay on the expensive side mostly because we were under the impression we would be staying inside of the park or at its borders but not on a random field 40 minutes away. 
The reception and food was nice what is to be expected for the price but they charged us heavily for an Arrack taster.

We enjoyed our stay but were glad that we were only staying one night. The safari was excellent (although the manager of the camp, who was in the same jeep as us, insisted on speaking loudly on his mobile phone while we were watching the elephants). Our naturist was a Spanish intern who was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. 

The camp itself was a disappointment.  We have done luxury camping in Africa and this is nowhere near the same standard. However, I appreciate that if you are used to standard camping this is a definite step up.  More irritating is that the camp is positioned very close to a mosque which ensures a broken night's sleep (and does not tie in with the location we were expecting).

As set out in the previous review (which we wish we'd read before staying) the camp is in a field some distance from the park. The tents are fairly small and the curtains dividing the 'bathroom' from the main tent did not close properly. However,  the beds are comfortable. 

We were told that there was hot water, although this did not appear to be working when we were there.  

On the plus side, the staff were all very friendly and enthusiastic. The bbq in the evening was also very tasty. 

If you are looking for luxury camping near to wildlife, this camp is not for you. However, if you enjoy camping generally this is a step up and the staff will ensure you enjoy your stay.","More camping with creature comforts than luxury","2013-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r154921605-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

On the day you were at the resort there was a major power outage in the area due to heavy rain and extra ordinary heavy wind for more than 24 hours. The resort was running on the backup generator for more than a day continously. The hot water delay issue is caused due to the power outage and the hot water was running on Solar Power. On this particular day it was windly and rainy therefore the delay in the hot water coming to the toilets as they have to come from the solar panels which is also close by. Further the telecom towers that belong to telecommunication companies in the area run out of their backup batteries after 6 hours of continous power failure the wi fi signal also does not work. As the office internet which is connected to a fibre line was working and thats what we provided you.

When i called the place in March 2022, they said no rooms are available. But then i saw a room is available through agoda.com but the room was $202 for bed and breakfast. Even though it seemed like a steep price for just an BnB, i booked the room anyway hoping it will be a beautiful experience. 

Let me tell you, location wise, view wise, i was not dissapointed. It was a marvellous view. The feeling of seeing the great mountains in the lush green and the cool mist when you open your eyes is incomparable. The seclusion, the privacy it provides is beautiful. Service was 
very good, they accomadated to our every need. 

We stayed at the ruby chalet, one of the cheaper options chalet wise. (I was not offered options since i had to grab the last one remaining).  It offers a space for the bed, a bathroom and a patio overlooking the beautiful mountains. If you need a bigger space, you need to book chalets that will be a bit more pricier.

However, i was dissapointed with the breakfast. A very minimal breakfast was offered with a very bland taste pallete. We as Srilankans do expect a better taste and better portions. For the price that was paid, it was not at all meeting expectations. 

Book directly with the hotel. Do not book with the travel sites, as they demand crazy rates and honestly, its not worth the price. The fullboard package if we would have booked directly with the hotel was actually half what we paid for BnB, and a decent price for what is offered. 

I do recommend the place highly though. Especially for honeymoon couples.","Beautiful views","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r834600028-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

When we checked in and were shown to where we were staying he clearly enjoyed pointing out everything to us and loved our reactions to the bathroom especially. 
There are lots of steps (it’s on a mountainside) so not convenient for anybody with mobility issues. The guard assisted us back to our room the first night by torchlight and I’m glad he did as I was almost caught out by a sneaky step up when we reached our hut!
Personally I thought the food could have been better, more options would have been helpful certainly. Service at mealtimes is good, I didn’t enjoy breakfast (sorry) we travelled throughout Sri Lanka during our stay and the food here ranked bottom for both of us. 
The pool was freezing and small and we seemed to be the only guests who used it during our stay. It was also the only place I felt uncomfortable lying in a swimsuit as when the majority (not all) of the male staff passed by they would openly look. I wish I didn’t have to say this but it was how I was made to feel. 
The room itself was very comfortable, I loved our deck at the front and the views as I’ve already said are absolutely breath taking. The shower was amazing, we both loved the rain head.

Review:

1. Drive to the place- good. Follow the signs not the map 

2. They will take the payment upfront. We asked why.. there has been cases of fraudulent cards and people not paying it seems- weird. New police as per mgt. Never paid ahead in any hotels we stayed during these vacation- The Palmstone Retreat, the Farm Resorts, Queenswood cottage, The Golden Ridge, and even at Cinnamon Wild Yala after Drean Cliff. 

3. Room is so tiny and bed is small for 3 of us. They wana charge 1k for the extra bed. First time that my daughter of 4 yrs old was asked to pay for her extra bed. When we raised it.. theu said they will not charge. But come on.. if we didn't  raise? .. 

4. When u enter the door.. foor or five steps then it is ur bed. Behind the wall is the washroom

5. I didn't like the echo inside the room. Guess it was built like due to it's dome-like design.

6. Water- they have their own spring water as per the pic. But u might not like the taste. Might as well buy one from outside 

7. The scene is great if u r lying down on ur bed and looking outside. But if ur on the veranda.. u will see another hotel. Expectations vs reality. See pic attached

8. We stayed in a cliff like this at Madulkelle eco longer. Their concept is glamping. It was raining and thundering too at the same time.. but I feel like the room had more space to move than this. if it is raining, THEY will call you and ask you to turn off the TV and unplug it.. leaving u with nothing to do but watch the rain. Haha. 

9. Inside the room is warm though it keeps raining. Place is ok for couples who like to stay in the room for themselves. Definitely not for longer stay. One night should be enough, otherwise one might get bored. 🤭

10. Valentines day event was nicely organized and well decorated

11. Furnitures r tastefully designed

12. Food was ok- don't know why some claims it'sgreat?! The steak served to us was burnt. I've tasted better. Farm Resorts food are simply delish!

My one complaint is that during dining service, you are hassled to fill out a survey for feedback. I can appreciate that they want to receive feedback for improvement, but forcing you to fill out the survey while trying to enjoy breakfast or dinner is not the way. I was asked to fill it out during dinner (as I was trying to leave) and then the next morning during breakfast.

I did encounter an issue with one of the staff members at the spa during my stay. While most of the team members were friendly and accommodating, there was a man who was extremely inappropriate during my treatment that made me unbelievably upset. Management of Chaarya Resort & Spa addressed my concern and ensured that actions were taken. Ladies, if you’re going to get a spa treatment, request a woman in case Dulop is still working there.

Deluxe Rooms were bit smaller but nice and clean. Hotel has a nice greenery Garden  and well maintained. Swimming Pool was really small. 

The Food was average specially no major variety for Lunch and Breakfast buffet. Dinner buffet was little bit ok. Mostly focused on Srilankan style of dishes and no western dishes.

We were going to visit YALA wildlife park thatvis aprox 30mins away from the establishment..
On arrival the reception staff were polite and curtious..
Check in was smooth..

Room was on 2nd floor ( 154) of one of the dwellings..
So in the heat , the steps up was hard work..
The room was clean and spacious. 
Plenty of space for luggage and clothes if staying for a few days..

Asked for drinks menu when we were in the restaurant, and staff member stated I can tell you what we have..
And he gave a list of drinks available..?
But for me, the way this was conveyed to us was very unprofessional and borderline rude to be honest..
So we then asked"" do you have
 wine..?""
Reply was "" glass ir bottle?. ""
No sir or madam ..
Never experienced this mannerism before in all our years of travelling..
My wife asked for some soda water, which turned uo with top off, generally restaurant staff in other establishments open a bottle infront of you..
Well..that bottle of soda was totally flat..and bottle top , bad a chip in the glass...
Seriously not good in my opinion..
Now, we go to get some food, that was a buffet style offering, and staff member stands there with 3 bottles of wine to choose from will trying to decide on what food to eat...
Staff really do require training in restaurant etiquette in my opinion..

The swimming pool is a nice size and very clean..

Now, here's one truly genuine good point..
We absolutely enjoyed our spa treatment while staying here...
Can't fault the staff in this part of the hotel.
The Barman in the area just down from pool area was also very good at his job.
And very attentive..
Perhaps these members of staff have had previous experience in customer service..
So a very well done too them..

Breakfast..
No orange juice was available..
And no infused water..
Which is generally normally a must in any hotel in my opinion. 
Never experienced this before on.our travels around the world...
Breakfast itself was a basic buffet type..

During Breakfast we were handed a customer feedback form..
Why then?
Why not leave form in room so you can chat about your experience together and leave form at reception when leaving..?

Because of the spa staff and the barman I have mentioned, this is why I have given a 3..
Otherwise it would have been a 2..

The downstair rooms had water ponds infront of them, this water was stagnant and flies / mosquitos were many..
Why not change or filter this water..?

So for the reasons I have written here, I'm sorry, not only would I NOT stay here again , I couldn't recommend it..
This is my personal experience..","Staff require training..","2022-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1102395-d1052197-r833927556-Chaarya_Resort_Spa-Tissamaharama_Southern_Province.html",

Nice location to stay while visiting the national parks. 
Beautiful, modern decorated villas set in garden of palm trees. 
Housekeeping stuff are doing an amazing job. Our room was very clean and had a small outdoor patio area which was amazing to chill out there with the bird voices at night.
There’s a heated pool, gym, spa facilities, games room, a nice bar as well. (As a short info; when it’s full moon they don’t serve alcoholic beverages according to the tradition.)

For negatives;

A large resort with poor food. Dried up steak, cold fries and breakfast wasn’t the best either. We recommend to eat at the restaurants next to the resort. 
I’d recommend to make an advanced payment for the safari tours at the front desk before it starts. Otherwise tour guys will ask for more money then what was quoted originally which was the thing that we’ve experienced. We’ve been told that we didn’t pay it at all even though we paid for it with a tip as well. It was the most uncomfortable experience! Trying to communicate with front desk with a language barrier is another challenge if you have an issue. 
Also reception staff had some attitude regarding our requests which wasn’t courteous! 

Nevertheless it was a good stay while visiting Tissamaharama. 

Here’s a couple of recommended places;
*Kirinda beach
*Elephant transit home
*Udawalawe national park safari 
*Yala national park (recommend a half day tour) it’s about half hour drive away.

However when we were in the ar different people where told different things were available. A later event for the group was also badly handled with people being told different times. Multiple times during the stay too many problems were created by lousy commication. 
The local food was cooked well and often excellent (Live stations) but softened for Western tastes which isn't unusual. However the Western options had some major problems as they had a habit of undercooking pasta and using cheese slices for lasagne or moussaka. 
The rooms were good with air conditioning in the bedroom but not the bathroom. An interesting quirk was that there was a step in the bedroom and bathroom. So getting to the toilet in the middle of the night could be interesting.

The staff was very friendly and forthcoming, the location including the pool and the terrace were amazing and the food was excellent. Although it is quite a walk until you reach a beach near which you can swim, the pool with the beautiful ocean view compensates for that.

However, in contrast to the high praises on tripadvisor which I have based my reservation upon, the room did not at all live up to my expectations. The ""Palmyrah Room"" we had booked was very small (almost completely taken up by the bed) and greatly overpriced over the Christmas break. There was one meager chair in the room, nothing to put your bags on, and truthfully, there would not have been enough space for it either...

In the end, we had a good time - however, travelers should not expect luxurious rooms, unless they book ""King Coco"".","Brilliant settings, tiny room...","2014-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d2461848-r247302724-Coco_Tangalla-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

It may be worth pointing out the showers are open to give a feeling of space,and with regard to your comment about one of the bathrooms being outdoors - yes,although partially covered,it's intentionally designed outside as is quite common in warm counties in Asia and elsewhere,and many people have enjoyed that experience.We are sorry one of your party tripped,and it should be explained that all but one of the rooms have no steps between the bathroom and bedroom,the house is built on the same level but there are steps to the verandah,and down to the pool area and garden but it's never been a complaint before...nor have mosquitoes to the degree you explain,as long as taken in the context that there will always be some in tropical countries - there are mosquito nets in all bedrooms,and as you say we do take as many further precautions as we can.For vegetarians,we are used to offering various options beyond sri lankan food,but most of our guests choose to have local dishes.

The rooms are beautifully appointed, and the breezy outdoor dining and lounging areas really quite inviting. It's the perfect place for a relaxing getaway from Colombo.

We did not find the rooms comfortable, however. Except for the two biggest rooms, all of the others are a bit dingy and dark. The beds are okay, but not terribly comfortable. One of the rooms has a bathroom that is completely outdoors. There are a lot of steps here and there, which make it a nightmare when it's dark and/or you cannot see very well. An older person in our party actually had a fall going to the bathroom in the night! Mosquitos are a major problem at this hotel. The staff light citronella lamps in the nights and put out mosquito nets. But, during the day, you're constantly swatting mosquitos all around you in the rooms. The bathrooms all have baths fitted with showers, but no shower curtains. So, when our showers were done, the bathroom floor was completely wet and slippery. 

The food options are a little limited - for instance, if you're vegetarian, you're pretty much stuck with curries with rice or string hoppers.","Has style, but could be improved","2014-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d2461848-r216986594-Coco_Tangalla-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Location: Beautiful, absolutely stunning view from the room, the pool feel like you are on top of the world. The room layout is nice, you do get the feeling that this is an older hotel but that adds to the class.

Service: The servers, bellmen were very friendly and helpful. The management, not so much, they seemed rude at times and too hung-up on the hotel polices on minor issues instead of keeping the customer happy. When asked if buy-3 beers get a pool game free (Rs200 value) can be started at bar and transferred to the pub they made a big fuss about it. Was finally allowed when I said I will not be getting any beers if not.
On second day of stay room was not made and supplies (tea/coffee) were not restocked. The fruits in the room were old and stale.

Food: Not good, seemed like they were always serving left over food from the previous day. The selection of food was limited and was not very well made, I usually like soups but 3 of 4 times I send back the soup I severed. The action station was was good but overcrowded most of the time.

Actives: They have a fair selection
Swimming pool : Good, nice location but closes at 6pm
Biking: (additional cost) Bikes not maintained, only allowed within hotel premises which is only about a 500m stretch. It made me laugh when I was planning on a adventurous bike ride but was tuned back at front gate.
Boat ride (additional cost) again its like riding a boat in a puddle of water.
Hike:

Upper Hunnas falls: nice 15 walk up to the falls, where you can take a dip at the base of the falls. *there are leaches

Hunnas peak: A good 1:15Hr hike to the peak of the mountain, bit steep at some places but quite manageable. the view from the top is fabulous. The only suggestion the trail should be marked by the hotel as they promote it as one of their activities, there weer no signs at all and we made many wrong turns on the way there and back.

All in all its and nice old hotel, we enjoyed our stay. The food and the services could definitely improve and not at the level of the value of money. I will probably go again if I get a discount rate.","Beautiful location average service and food","2019-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r740765192-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

This stay taught me a few lessons about the hotel industry and about Amaya chain in particular. Rule No1: Hotel website may not give you the cheapest rate and their ""best available rate"" is not their best available rate. I was confused to a point that I thought that Amaya marketing was cheating, but it seems I am not able to use that term technically. Even when you call, you do not get the ""best available rate"" but rather the highest rate they can charge :D. We have not faced this kind of situations with other hotel chains and so we were upset (from a locals point of view) and they still have this old process of booking (card offers for locals) where they tell you to send photo copies of your ID and Credit Card over email - rather than providing us with a custom booking link to book over the internet using their reservations engine.

When we checked in there was a mistake done by Amaya corporate and it had been 2 doubles rather than the triple and double we required. The front desk tried to trick us by giving a double with an extra bed rather than a triple room (triple is twice the size of a double). Had to talk a couple of times before they realized we knew what a triple room is and got us shifted to one. I did not get my welcome drink as well, I am not fuzzy but when you call yourself a luxury hotel, you cannot miss something like that (i came a bit later than the other as I went to park the vehicle and my told them I did not get the drink but still they did not take note).

Then entire hotel is in a somewhat a dilapidated state. We could not understand what upgrade this property has gone through as it seems to have rather got downgraded. Things were imperfect everywhere (I am not trying to be a perfectionist,client but when a hotel charges you at a 5 star rate and is labelled as a luxury hotel, how can one be happy when you are presented with a 3 star quality?). However looking at the endless positive feedback on trip advisor and the great positive comments on the guest book, I am now wondering whether I am in fact fuzzy guest or if the majority of the visitors had been very easy to please.

There was a spelling mistakes in the key card (shorts were shots) & a grammatical mistake (photo uploaded). If they do not proof read the key card and if none of the officers in that hotel picks that up, you can imagine what sort of sloppy quality management the hotel goes through.

Food is quite average, range is not much and the deserts are a few. I suppose since there are not many guests the hotel can accommodate thus we can justify the lack in the range but they need to make it up with quality. Fruits did not look fresh and I saw bananas which had black patches.

Most people visit a hotel in a secluded place like this is to relax and stay in the hotel. So it is important that they have some activities available. Strangely they charge for using the tennis court from full board guests. Charging for mini-golf is acceptable. The games room is in bad shape as well. Did not see a Spa or Gym (maybe they have but we did not come across). There was a good large flat TV but unfortunately just 10 channels and most of them were not clear.

We were on a triple room but everything was in twos (towels, glasses etc). I am not sure if this is the norm but thinking logically it does not seem correct.

The shower handle in our room did not work properly. The lever returns normal after some time cutting off the water to the shower. So had to hold on to the lever whilst bathing.. Some luxury experience we were having :D.

Did not find the pool very clean either and they close it early around 6). The unisex pool changing room is like a public toilet. Shocking.!!!

This hotel is one of a kind. I doubt if there is another one similar to this in Sri Lanka and which is the reason we want to come back and show it off to our family who did not come last time However we could see that it was not so from the road itself before entering the property. It is understandable the grass may not be so green with the high heat these days but still badly trimmed plants and gardening cannot be excused as this is the key marketing point of the hotel.

The questions I have after visiting Hunnas
1. Is this an actual Small Luxury hotel or are they using an old expired title to market the place.
2. If this is in fact a SLH, is this a title that a hotel can buy without meeting standards?
3. How come this property is so highly recommended by visitors? I too will highly recommend this if this was a 3 star hotel.

I got to know that Amaya is going to be change management. Perhaps this is the reason for the lack of motivation of the staff to excel. Lets hope things will improve with the new management.

Notes to Management:
If you want to be a SLH you need to do the following:
- Greet the guests at the entrance (you can easily do that as your security at the gate checks guests in) and provide a scented tissue and not forgetting to give a welcome drink to everyone.
- Get valet parking
- Get New carpeting / curtains / bed linen (some were torn)
- Make sure the showers / toilets work
- Get some good cable channels (which shows clearly)
- Break down  the pool changing room, it’s a disgrace
- Spell check your literature 
- Train your staff and you can stand out if your staff at the reception and head at the reception knows the clients by name (since it’s a small place)
- Make sure someone is always there to answer when a guest dials the reception.
- Implement a key card system (doors)
- Do not try to cheat the guests
- Keep a guest feedback survey brochure in the room or get the front desk to check on guest experience and mitigate any negativity before it goes out of hand. That way you may be able to avoid this type of embarrassing reviews going up on trip advisor as well.","3 Star Luxury Hotel at a 5 star Price","2019-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r662702291-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

The hotel has been around for a long time and I wish they would have given an effort to repair the roads or maybe even inform the road authorities about it.
I must say the location is fantastic, no other place I’ve been has been this stunning and relaxing. It seems the hotel has ben refurbished couple of years ago and is maintained well especially the outside surroundings considering the harsh climate conditions.
We booked 2 rooms about 3 months ago and they managed to give 2 rooms further away when we requested 2 rooms next to each other. It’s a busy hotel, it can be excused I guess.
Our room smelled bad when we went in and it seemed it was coming from the chairs. I understand that it rains a lot in that area and guests may leave wet jackets and clothes on the chairs, but the hotel must make sure extra care is taken to make sure the accommodation is comforting. 
Dinner was exceptional, lots of variety and the food was tasty however I which I could say the same about the breakfast. The chef kept getting my food orders wrong and food would almost never arrive to my table when they said they would deliver to my table.
It is hotel standard to be able to call from one room to another, we tried to do that, but it keeps going to the receptionist, who might I say picked up the calls rarely.
I sense the problem is the staff is too less for a hotel which is very busy.
Overall Hunas is a very reputed hotel and may be overrated sometimes, nevertheless it is a must visit since there lots of activities to do and i recommend staying at least 2 nights to fully enjoy the surrounding nature (also since it rains a lot so you may need 2 nights to do that.","Expected more","2018-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r610053952-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

This hotel is above in the hills close to Kandy and it takes a minimum of an hour to reach the main town. If, you want to get away from the daily grind and want to be one with nature, this is the hotel you should go to. The trails in and around the hotel will make you feel as if you have no contact with civilization and it is very peaceful. The views from the hotel are just too beautiful to be true. The hotel also has people who can take you to the Upper Hunas falls and the Hunas falls. They also have a naturalist (very interesting) who can take you bird watching or trekking to the highest hill close to the hotel. However, this requires advance trekking and climbing skills. Be prepared. That said, there is a decent running trail (about 600 mts) all around the lake and a small well-maintained golf course. The hotel interiors need to be modernized. The wifi sucks. We felt that the hotel should have a shop selling basic amenities, since it is so far away from town. The breakfasts are very enjoyable, even though the staff is very proprietary about the tables on the verandah outside and keep them reserved for honeymooners only. We felt this was absurd. We enjoyed the lovely freshly cut fruit, hoppers and the other breakfast buffet items. The other meals we had were ok. We weren't impressed overly and the structure of the menu was focused around middle eastern guests. So, be prepared for a very small a la carte dinner and lunch menu. This said, it is a great getaway.","Location is beautiful but ONLY if you want to get away from it all","2016-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r422864569-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

On a positive note, the hotel is in a great location in the centre of Galle Fort meaning that pretty much everything in Galle Fort is a few minutes walk away.

Upon arrival, we were ushered into the entrance lounge area of the hotel when we arrived to check-in and were then shown to our room which was on the ground floor near the main restaurant area.  The room is split over 2 levels with downstairs being the lounge area and bathroom a mezzanine floor to the upstairs bedroom.

While I understand the charm of this being an old hotel, it is on desperate need of some modernisation to make it liveable.  Every movement that ANY GUEST in our side of the hotel made resulted in floor boards squeaking (and every floorboard squeaks) which resulted in very little sleep over our 3 night stay.  The furniture in the rooms is perfectly in-keeping with the look and style but is not functional with no real wardrobe space, barely a sofa etc. and possibly the flattest pillows I have ever seen. There are no curtains in the room (and neither the doors nor windows shut properly) resulting in being woken up at sunrise and the added 'delight' of an extra dining table being positioned right outside our room door meant we were awoken each morning with the chaos of the team cleaning the dining and pool area and setting up for breakfast.

We went for breakfast on our first morning however were really disappointed with the temperature of the food we were served so didn't have breakfast in the hotel again.  The bar in the hotel is very impressive however service was slow (we gave up on our 2nd night even trying to find a staff member for a drink!)  

I'm not sure I would return to Galle as there really isn't a lot to see or do, but if I did I would probably stay next door at Fort Bazaar instead!","Disappointing","2023-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r900513012-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

,

Clearly the Galle Fort Hotel did not meet your expectations during your stay and it was marred by some regrettable and most unfortunate incidents. It is not the way we conduct our business as is apparent with our other reviews.I believe your main contention with us was the bathroom sink not draining hence before the room is given to the guest we always clean the room and wash the sink and nothing was block at that moment but our maintenance team found some biscuits in the drainage which have been washed off in the sink 
In addition I also want to address a few of your other complaints;
.the breakfast been delayed i did have a chat with you that morning and as to my knowledge you have ordered one English breakfast and Srilankan breakfast So the server took the same time period to serve both dishes because it needed to be served to gather as the normal service method so this is what made your breakfast delay as you have mentioned above 
I would assure that all these issues will be fixed ASAP and will look forward to create a memorable stay on your next visit 

However, I do hope the rest of your trip was good and that your family had an enjoyable time in Sri Lanka.

Thank you for bringing these problems forward. I  apologies that you had  less space in your wardrobe  however,  all of this is linked with the 400 year old Dutch House concept , which drags the guest back in to the colonial era , well as the large expanse of stone flooring gives out a cooling feel to the room which blends nature in  the room  so most of our guest who have stayed in this room really loved this concept ,
With regard to the staff need to be seek more often , please be assured that we will be looking to refurbish our Public areas in the near future, which will cover all aspects of guest convenience of meeting the staff in public areas Eg- Reception etc...

Thank you once again for sharing your experience with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back to The Galle Fort Hotel.

There is no doubt it could be again. However, in spite of some of the surprisingly positive reviews here on Trip Advisor, it most certainly isn’t now. 
The raw material is there. Excellent location, lovely historic building, impressive common areas, lovely courtyard for meals and, last but not least, excellent friendly service. BUT....
...as several reviewers have mentioned, the rooms desperately need some TLC and money spending on them and the kitchen needs an overhaul. 
First the room. Again the raw material is there in terms of construct, but badly stained chair covers, frayed and dirty carpet, slightly leaking roof, smell of drains,  rickety cupboards, dimmer not working, etc, all demand renovations, which the helpful manager admitted were being undertaken in the next few months. Too late for me! 
Now to the food. As has also been mentioned elsewhere, and on the basis of one meal only (stayed for 5 nights but only ate there on the first), the dinner standard is well below other restaurants in Galle (eg curry served cold is not an appetising prospect), for example the excellent Fort Printers down the road. Breakfasts are below average compared to the 4 other hotels of similar rating that I stayed in. As an example, a tiny bowl of what they called muesli contained mainly bran and corn flakes. However, these are minor matters compared to the rooms. 
Such a pity. Galling in fact...","Galling....","2018-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r632292718-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for bringing these problems forward. I do apologies that you had to wait for your dessert for so long, and that your food was cold when delivered to your table. We have no excuse for either incident however, and I do apologize for this once again. We have in fact taken steps to re look at our processes to ensure consistency along with making sure the Kitchen sends out all food at the correct temperature.

With regard to the cocktails that the ""staff did not know"", I'd like to place on record that the Food and Beverage manager personally took charge of the order given that there seemed to be some confusion as to the name of cocktail you wanted. Nevertheless I believe all was sorted soon after, when the Manager explained the situation to you and offered you alternative drinks, which you had two rounds of before dinner. 

With regard to the lighting in the room, please be assured that we will be looking to refurbish our rooms in the near future, which will cover all aspects of guest convenience and comfort.

Thank you once again for sharing your experience with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back to The Galle Fort Hotel.

We had stayed in some genuine top-class places by international standards during our time in Sri Lanka and it paled in comparison to them.  
True, the building, a former merchant’s house, is a bit of Galle history and its public rooms have a colonial style but our ground-floor poolside room needed a bit of tlc, particularly the bathroom.  
•	The bathroom was ill-lit, making a wet shave a hazardous experience.
•	The bed-sitting room was a decent size but there was no bedside light on one side of the bed so I could not read in bed without using my cell phone’s flashlight.
•	No one thought to tell us there were outside shutters on the upper part of the large windows, nor close them for us, so people on the upper floor opposite could see into our bathroom when we were getting ready for dinner.
•	Dinner itself, enjoyed overlooking the pool, has had criticism in the past and we had the same issues – food arrived lukewarm and our dessert (a simple plate of tropical fruit) was forgotten altogether. We had to go in search of a waiter to get it.
•	The barman did not seem to have heard of a gin martini (or they didn’t have vermouth, I am not sure which) so we had to settle for something else pre-dinner.
•	The hotel has a terrace open to the road at the front and a happy hour. We had arrived early afternoon and there was what appeared a back-packer group having a lovely, and noisy, time over a few beers as we walked in. Galle Fort town has a definite back-packer feel to it generally.
All in all a disappointingly average experience for our last night in the country.","A disappointing end to a wonderful visit to Sri Lanka","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r619497818-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Many thanks for your review and feedback after your 2 night stay with us in the hotel
I will first start with a small brief about the room you were occupying while you were with us ,The Grand Apartment occupies the entire top floor of the old wing and has two king-sized bedrooms with en suite bathrooms and a private veranda. Covering an area of 2,500 square feet its architecture is Georgian in style and it has a beautiful collection of 17th century Dutch furniture including two period spiral king size beds. It is a shame you did not mention any dissatisfaction with the Room sitting area which been shared with the other room , if you did we would always have an alternative option to be done and also we have not got any issue in this as a sharing living room. We would have been more than happy to assist
your comment on ""Massive bathroom but no bathtub"" will be a good helping tip for us to consider, thank you very much for sharing your great ideas with us.and also please note we have all details about the the room facilities on the web site .All of our staff are friendly and approachable at any time of the day and if things were not to your satisfaction as you have mentioned service was slow , i would like to bring to your notice that the Ala carte .orders do take a maximum of 20 mins to prepare food which is ordered and we will look in to making it more faster in near future 
I am glad that you enjoyed the common areas for relaxing

Was recommended this hotel as the best hotel in Galle. Booked the Grand Apartment 1. Which is the highest catagory the hotel offers. Checked in and all went well. Then I went to our room only to explain that whilst I had booked a suite, the sitting room of the suite is shared with other guests using the other half of the suite - totally bizarre and mind blowing. Of course no privercy.  Bitterly disappointed by the way the hotel thought this to be quite normal. 

Massive bathroom but no bathtub - this is supposed to be a luxury suite. 

Food is good at the hotel but the service dreadfully slow. Maybe Sri Lanka moves at a slow pace, and maybe I should be more tolerant. I was on vacation after all. Nice to relax and common areas are well kept.

Your description of the hotel, its atmosphere and charm have certainly resonated well with you and I thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed that
The lightnings & standard needs in every room are pre checked by the House keeper so no shortfalls will be placed in rooms in future , we are great full that you have brought this to our notice  
And i regret that the WIFI was not sufficient enough for your expectation since we had a data drop in this period which was fixed in the later period 
The other side of your experience is obviously not so welcome but the hotel is prepared to accept that guests will tell us if service standards   are falling well short of their expectations. In your case our staff were far too slow delivering you drink orders, looking for drink orders or taking care of guests generally. I appreciate your comments and in response can only say that since your left I have increased the number of staff working in the hotel, am monitoring management supervision on the ground more closely, rolling out in - house training programs and expect to see service delivery improve all round.

The public rooms, verandas etc are perfection and the rooms could be too if a little more care was taken with them.  The lighting, for example, in our garden room was appalling, not helped by some of them just not working.  The shower and WC areas were showing signs of mould and the WC itself didn't work.  Three visits from the maintenance guy didn't solve the problem (the whole internal mechanism needed replacing) and I didn't call housekeeping again as we could make it work by leaving the lid off the cistern.  Every day  housekeeping duly put the lid back on, (Instead of bothering to replenish the tea, coffee etc)!
The wifi was infuriating until one of our party, who had to deal with some business problems, went to the office and suggested that they contact their server.  It improved after that. 
We ate in the hotel on our first night and the food was pretty average.  The service, however, was dreadful.  E.g. We'd ordered wine which didn't turn up till we'd finished eating.  Breakfast service was equally bad.  The staff were all exceptionally pleasant, but ineffectual but I suppose the waiter can't help it if the kitchen is going at a snail's pace.

One of our group had stayed here about 7-8 years previously and said it had gone downhill.  An intensive staff training programme and a refurb of the bedrooms would make all the difference.","Lovely hotel.

The bread was very stale and the presentation of the jams etc was really poor. What we were really disappointed with was the lack of staff anywhere, it was honestly ghost town. There was a really noisy family with kids screaming for hours on end in the small pool outside which meant from 4 until 8 you couldn't relax at all and there was no one around to either complain too or ask them to please reduce the sound. We were really shocked when we left to go out for dinner that the family's belonging including shoes, trunks, old food on plates were spread everywhere and nothing had been cleared away until early hours the next morning. The family really did treat it like it was their own villa which was a real shame. If there had been staff around maybe they could have cleared the plates or asked the family to move their stuff.

There's nothing quite like falling asleep to the sound of waves. 

Check in was a little distorted as there are three lantern hotels within 600 m of each other on this road. The location we stayed in had no reception and the check in was in our room and the information on the hotel was given to us hurriedly by a member of staff. When we came down from our room and needed to speak to staff it was hit or miss if they were there or not and sometimes we would wander round trying to find someone.

The location of the hotel was around 2.5km from the center of town and tuk tuks are always available however it's not really walkable especially after sunset. We arranged pick up one morning for a whale watching tour and the staff tried to get us to ride in the wrong tuk tuk and wouldn't really listen to our protests, eventually they realised their mistake and apologised however if we hadn't been so sure of ourselves they could have hampered the plans we had!

While waiting for our tuk tuk one evening waiting in the dining area we did sight a rat in the kitchen area, but I'm willing to accept it as a one off as the entire hotel was very clean. I did mention it to staff and they assured me they would sort it.

Otherwise the hotel was, as previously mentioned, beautifully decorated and very relaxing. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the food is the nearby ""main hotel"" was absolutely delicious, a little more expensive than in the town but you'd expect this from a hotel.

The view from the pools and the ocean view rooms is incredible (it feels like you're about 10 feet from the ocean) and everything is clean and modern. The beach was basically deserted while we were there which was great though you did feel a bit limited for eating options (you could walk a couple hundred feet down the beach to the sister hotel for meals or take a tuk tuk into town but you can't just walk along the beach and see dozens of restaurants). 

The food at the hotel was good though a bit pricey compared to local options (everything is listed in USD). The staff was very helpful and friendly.

The location is probably the only drawback - if you want to spend all day on the beach or in the pool and are happy just eating at the hotel restaurant then this place is absolutely perfect. But if you want to eat an local places it's a little inconvenient - not because of distance but because you have to go through the process of changing out of your swimsuit, getting a tuk tuk, finding a place, etc. rather than just throwing on a sarong and walking along the beach. It's also slightly too far from Mirissa proper to just walk along the road.

One note - some of the pictures make it seem like you have a private plunge pool attached to your room (or maybe that's just my mistake). The pools are actually outside the lobby. They're great but I had made the mistake of thinking they were outside our room so that was a little disappointing.

The ocean was a little rough (strong waves/current) which might not be good for kids. One of our drivers said that further into Mirissa is a lot calmer than Galle where the hotel is.

Overall the hotel is really, really nice but the price and slightly inconvenient location make it only 3 stars in my mind.","Nice views, bit pricy","2017-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r463490543-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

The food and beverage department needs improvement. There isn't a coffee shop in the lobby, so if you have guests between breakfast and lunch, you won't have anywhere to eat.

The room rate was fair, but the hotel is quite small, small reception area is small. Breakfast was bedlam. 
Far too many people descended at once.

They were desperately trying to put everything out but it wasn’t working well. They don’t chill their juices so they pop a few ice cubes in the top. If you catch it first you’re lucky, you’ll get cold juice. If you miss that then you’re in for a mouthful of warm juice.

Bread was stale on the second day, just cutting corners and it was also busy… I think they offer breakfast to everyone hence the issues with quality, margarine not butter, warm juice and stale bread…

I probably wouldn’t return, service at the bar wasn’t great and the pool was tiny. The hotel pictures make you think it’s swimmable but realistically it’s not even 10 metres long!","A basic offering, chaotic breakfast","2023-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5279732-r906483692-Radisson_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

When I requested for a surprise cake for my mom to our room on a payable basis they gracefully accepted to deliver a surprise cake without any added charges as a compliment! It’s so nice of them to do such complimentary surprises to the room on guest’s requests! My mom was super surprised, job well done by their staff members 🤗

Our room was all well furnished and all up to standards! But we had a very nice room with no balcony available for us to get any fresh air or admire the view of the sea by feeling that salty wind on our face! I don’t know why but they must be having their reasons for that! 

We stayed their for 2days and one night on a bed and breakfast basis where I felt it’s a little expensive but still completely compromised by their cozy room and that beautiful view from my room! How can I forget to mention their infinity pool on the rooftop, had a great time in the pool again with that sea view! They also have a bar right next to the pool where not only the residents but also the common people pay random visits anytime during the day! that might put you in little uncomfortable place if you are also a shy person like me, when you are already in the pool and surrounded by many people! 

They have a restaurant called “EAT AT OZO” where they do buffets which is situated in widely spaced area with very good furnitures and interior designs which I thoroughly admired! They do have a great sea view from the dining area which was great! Their food range was good but not that great also not that much of staff attention, for example on their buffet table if any dish was over they don’t pay attention to refill it soon, so you had to give up trying that dish instead of just trying that dish if they refill it on time!

Overall we had a great time staying at Ozo Colombo and my mom enjoyed staying here!","View was great","2020-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5279732-r778002203-Radisson_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Начать стоит с особенностей планировки номера типа deluxe, планировка ""открытая"", из кабинки с унитазом резкий запах канализации, душевая кабина свободно сообщается с комнатой и входом. Вторая проблема - питания, дело вовсе не в качестве питания, а в системе всё включено. Мы приобрели тур с системой всё включено и пожалели. К примеру, в стоимость AI не входит чай в ресторане и баре, его предлагают пить в номере!! Кофе только в основном ресторане Blue tan. Почти каждый день обеды по меню!!!, 23.01.2025 и ужин был по меню, поскольку проводилась свадьба. Свадьба - отдельная головная боль. Шатёр и прочие сооружения возвели близко от номеров. Мы проживали на 1 этаже и гости свадьбы находили возможным сидеть на нашем балконе. Разумеется, свадьба была шумной,что мешало отдыху. Бассейн неглубокий, в самой глубокой зоне достигает 1,2 метра.  Бассейн закрывается в 19:00. Проход к океану так же закрывается в 19:00. Да, он тут по разрешению охраны. Никаких прочих активностей нет. В первые два дня постоянно приходилось решать проблемы с тем что, что-либо не работает. Не открывалась дверь на балкон, затем не работал потолочный вентилятор. 
В целом, отель отличный, но при покупке тура необходимо понимать все особенности. Это не резорт, не пляжный отель, а городской отель хорошего уровня.
К сожалению, нам, как и многим прочим туристам из России позиционировали этот отель как пляжный с хорошей системой всё включено.","Разочарование ","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r990372137-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Upon arrival it feels like we have arrived at a ministry or something. Bare cold entrance.
The staff behave like some kind of government employees. No hospitality feeling at all and somewhat bureaucratic. I understand that hotels at this level are a bit more formal, but still.
The room itself is nice, fairly new and comfortable, nice view. Bluetan the restaurant where we decide to have lunch is empty and feels a bit soulless, actually the whole hotel feels soulless. Staff is correct and in large numbers, therefore somewhat inefficient. The pool man and bar man are a lot more personal and efficient. The beach is also cold, furniture is without atmosphere and covered in bird droppings. Half the swimming pool is without water. The entire building looks like a prison from the outside.  An question about an excursion on their own website, 4 people have to consult, as if we are asking for something very special.

We had a deluxe room with direct pool access. While the room was nice and tidy, the design of the room was slightly awkward. The bathroom and shower area are separate and the closet is quite small for what you'd expect from a luxury hotel.

The room provides toiletries but falls shorts in terms of amenities. In terms of the hotel's offerings, they have a big pool, good gym, and an excellent spa that you must experience when staying. I had the balinese massage and Julie was my masseuse. She worked out my stressed muscles wonderfully!

In terms of the food, it wasn't the best. They had a good spread, but could definitely improve. Staff are friendly. One recommendation I could say is the pool needs to be regularly cleaned as it had a lot of gunk floating around.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We decided to go to Heritance for our last days at Sri Lanka. The hotel appears as a luxurious resort, but there are some big bursts in this bubble.
The bookingprocess at their own website has some flaws. If you come with children you have to pay 30 dollars extra per night for a extra bed. During our booking we checked the boxes for our child and his age, so we expected the extra fee for an extra bed was already paid. But no.. so the communication can improve on their website.

A part of the pool was closed for cleaning (funny I saw no one cleaning it). The sunbeds stand in a beautiful garden with well maintained grass. Unfortunately the sunbeds can have some maintaince to. Cracked linnen, so comfort is not so high. The man who gives the beachtowels was not friendly at all. 
Upon arrival our curtains could not close the whole window. This was nicely repaired the next day.
Clean up service let our balcony door open after cleaning and they forgot to replace our towels one day. When we asked for new towels we had to wait 45 minutes to get new ones. And of course they brought two in stead of three.
Because our flight was early we were not able to have our breakfast. They provided the service of a take away box. But again, they gave us two in stead of three.
Beeakfast buffet is nice and has lots of choices.
I wouldn't reccommend this hotel. Next trip I will try Jetwing blue if i want to stay in five star hotel.

The hotel is lovely, the staff extremely welcoming and attentive but there were a few points that meant we ended up feeling a bit disappointed. 

First the location - 1km off the main road (the A6). It’s hidden away and not easy to find. Our taxi driver there said it was the first time he’s driven on that village road. It’s peaceful but you are stuck there, reliant on the Hotel calling a tuktuk orTaxi. 

Second, it’s is billed as a cultural resort. The only entertainment was one evening a chap playing Western songs on a keyboard. The rest of the time was taped music of Western hits sung locally. And apart from the lovely pool there is nothing to do. Nothing. 

Finally, after lots of lovely food on our holiday, we were really disappointed with the food - buffet at breakfast and dinner. You really don’t have much choice but to eat there; and it was a mix of Western food and Sri Lankan gloop. Not spicy and though fresh wasn’t up to the standard we’d hoped for. We did have an excellent curry and rice one lunch (having got back from Sigiriya earlier than expected) so the chef can work wonders. It’s obvious though that it’s small mass catering (but only about 20 tables). 

The costs of getting around weren’t too bad (1800Rps to get a tuktuk to the rock and back, while the driver waits. All in about a four hour round trip with a 20 minute drive there and back. And 10.000 to get to Kandy in a taxi taking about 2.5 hours. 

For a couple of days chilling away from the noise and bustle and sitting by the pool, it could suit you. You can do trips from the hotel - it’s easy to reach Sigiriya and Dambulla and you can also get a safari from there. It just wasn’t right for us. ","Quiet, relaxing place to stay.

We tried the breakfast which had numerous choices on offer. 
We stayed 3 nights - the first two nights were fine, the beds are really comfortable and we had an awesome sleep but on our last night there were several families with kids staying and partying. The kids were slamming doors and running and shouting in the corridors and woke us up several times. The hotel is all tiles, concrete and hard surfaces so the noise carried.

Minus's my menu had the steak price increased from 2000 to 3000 rupees in biro, I queried this and was informed that it was Australian steak. There were 4 of us dining, but only 3 of us had starters, 2 soups, which were very nice, and 1 mixed salad that didn't have the dressing that was described on the menu. 1 main course which was jumbo prawns arrived before we had finished our starters, which we sent back. When the mains arrived, I had ordered the steak,to be cooked medium rare,bit came medium raw, it was returned, on the menu it stated in a red wine sauce, no sauce, but the biggest problem was that it wasn't Australian steak, just local steak, I have lived in Sri Lanka for many years and know local steak. 
This to me is a complete and utter con job.to be fair the other 3 meals were acceptable but over priced for what you got, when they got them right, the prawnsh have had no salad, but french fries and rice, but came with salad, the pork chop should have had vegetables, but none arrived, until I commented.so all in all not the best experience.

It’s the rest of the hotel that lets it down. The corridors are dark and smell musty, the rooms tired and in serious need of updating. Of the three windows in my room, only one could be opened without an effort, there was no fridge in the room, the TV didn’t work (no biggie for me as I was too busy to want to watch, but this shouldn’t happen) . The hot water bottles delivered to the room every evening were a nice touch but necessary as the rooms had no heating or cooling and Nuwara Eliya gets quite cold at night. Despite this, only once thin bedcover was provided, necessitating the donning of extra clothes once the hot water bottles cooled down. The staff were very accommodating and if people complained, issues were fixed. For example, a fridge was delivered to a room when asked for, however, in a 5* hotel this amenities should be standard.

We were moved to a less grand but lovely garden room with a newly renovated bathroom the next morning. Lovely room but had constant buzz from electricity box. 😡
The staff are really lovely and friendly.  The bar area with log fires are so inviting and really good cocktails. The breakfast is good but could be improved, cannot comment on the evening meals as never ate at hotel.
The gardens are really spectacular.  
The hotel has so much to offer and it could be really good with some renovation which I know they are currently undertaking.

The waiting staff are very kind and work very hard to ensure a good experience. Breakfast was really excellent and we had formal dinner for 14 in members dining room which was great. Some of our guests borrowed jackets which added to the fun of the evening. Negative side the decor really lets the hotel down. The bedroom furnishings are so dated and everything would benefit from a fresh coat of paint. The women’s bathroom near the dining room has been renovated and it’s gorgeous. The rest of the hotel needs to follow suit and quickly. There is a quaint component to the current decor but it’s hard to see it. Hot waters bags cute touch in evening.
