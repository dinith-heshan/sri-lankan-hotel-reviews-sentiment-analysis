The facility is small and cozy that gives you a feeling of being like at home. Hotel management and team are very friendly, smiling and caring. All services are absolutely great, and even extra for a 4-star level. The meals are very delicious providing a variety of the local and other countries’ food. The hotel beach is very calm and comfortable with a nice pool next to it. There are many sightseeing locations in the close vicinity where you can go by tuk-tuk always available next to the hotel. I would recommend the Cocobay hotel to all tourists who want to explore Sri Lanka.

If you're looking to unwind, relax, and recharge, this is the perfect place.

We had a room with a private plunge pool, which was spotless and cleaned every morning. Impressively, even if a leaf fell in, the lifeguard would somehow sense it and appear with a net to fish it out—amazing attention to detail!

The hotel is tucked away in a peaceful spot, just a short 15-minute tuk tuk ride to Galle or Unawatuna, making it feel like a serene escape without being too far from town.

From the moment we arrived, the reception team made us feel completely welcome with a delicious welcome drink and a smooth check-in process.

All the staff were friendly and accommodating, always ready to help. The housekeeping team was especially thoughtful—one day, we returned to find the cutest towel elephant waiting for us on the bed!

If you're an animal lover, you’ll adore the two gentle, affectionate resident dogs, Spicy and Chia. They were a joy to be around and made the place feel even more homely.

We also really enjoyed dining at Le Mer, the in-house restaurant. The food was delicious, and the team was more than happy to accommodate our preferences.

Cocobay Unawatuna is a hidden gem and holds a special place in our hearts. It's ideal for couples looking for a peaceful, romantic, and heartwarming getaway. We’ll definitely be back!","Second Stay – Even Better Than the First!

The suite was enormous and had two seating areas, a large bed, a minibar area, walk in wardrobe area, large bathroom with two sinks. We had three days here and lover every minute. The sunset views from the private beach are beautiful and you can pop across the lagoon carefully to eat at a local Seafood restaurant on the beach. It is a short ride on a Tuk Tuk into Unawatuna town where there are lots of places to eat and drink. The hotel breakfast was lovely and I ate the asri Lankan curry both days, especially enjoying the Dahl and Red Fish Curry.

The pool was partly not under the sun, which is important considering traveling with children in Sri Lanka. Great hospitality both in the hotel and in the hotel restaurant! The food, both local and international, offered a taste experience :) You could eat inside the restaurant, on the terrace or even with your toes in the sand on the beach. Our room was large and clean, with a sea view. We were very happy with the room. Location to the city - across the river and you are in Galle.

It is still a small working tea estate and all of the accommodation are rooms in what was the estate owners house and that added a really authentic feel to our stay.  The communal lounge was really nice, though we were never in there, all of our free time was spent at the lovely pool or, for meals and early evening drinks, out on the front terrace with beautiful views out over the hills.  The bedrooms and bathrooms were very nicely furnished and comfortable. Something to be aware of is that there is no air conditioning and, although it is much cooler than down in Kandy town, we needed all of the windows open at night and, with no screens on the windows this resulted in some quite large spiders visiting. The tea tour with the estate manager was really interesting and the waterfall is a beautiful place for a dip before the arduous trek back up to the house. We were the only guests whilst we were there and it felt, at times, like they were not really fully open. There was only really one member of staff evident who filled the role of front of house, waiter, barman and fixer. He was great but, if he had gone off elsewhere, then we felt like we were living in a big house where we didn’t know where anything was or how it worked. It didn’t feel quite right to go into a “hotel” kitchen in search of milk for a cup of tea.  With a little more attention to detail and customer service, this place could be a really unforgettable stay.","A beautiful stay in a bit of a bygone era.","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r959417820-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

The swimming pool is nearby, well shaded from too much sun, but consequentially fresher than the Sri Lankan norm.
My slight niggle with the experience was the additional cost (mentioned in other reviews).  I think $30 pp for a dinner was about twice the price that we paid elsewhere for about the same. 
The wander around the tea part of the estate was well worth it in a relaxed way.  A picnic at the waterfall was lovely (but price-y for what it was) (by the way, keep an eye out for leeches - and on the tea walk)

However, as others have noted there is no transparency over the cost of anything-no prices displayed anywhere. It is true that one can ask, but once arrived, you are a captive audience, as the drive is long and there is nowhere else for miles around.
Another word of caution- we thought that the picnic by the waterfall was exceptionally over priced- it didn’t accord with the photos, and consisted of a wrap, few fries and a soft drink or two. Cost of $20 each seemed steep at the time, and then the final bill stated that the price of the food wasn’t even included- we had to challenge this and it was withdrawn. $20 dollars each without food?

The food was very good, with the Sri Lankan picnic provided for our One Tree Hill visit, being the culinary highlight of our stay. Although the meals were in general very good, breakfast proved to be a little disappointing: small portions of fruit; eggs; sliced white bread and jam.

We cannot give a higher rating for the Ashburnham Estate as we were somewhat unsatisfied with the room. The room itself was very dusty (dirty) and the furniture needs a lot of TLC, and an upgrade of furniture would be even better. Plus the bathroom (+fittings) was also quite shabby and not as clean as we expected it to be. Perhaps we could have ignored all this, had it not been for the ant invasion.Our futile efforts at dealing with the army proved useless, and when we mentioned the problem to the staff we were informed that there was nothing that could be done.... We were not offered another room. We did ask that the bedroom and bathroom be rid of the dead ants, however, upon our return later to the room nothing had been done, and the bathroom sink and shower were still full of the results of our ant battle.... Hopefully, the hotel will resolve this kind of problem more efficiently in the future.

The food was nice served by the lovely Vish.
Amil  and Rako the dog took us on a very beautiful walk to the tree where the views are breathtaking in the tea plantations.
He also took us with the naturalist on a even more spectacular walk in the tea plantations and through a pine forest and down by the lake and through villages !Unforgettable for sure !
The nice thing is that you can start these hikes directly from the estate without having to drive anywhere.

In the heart of some of the most breathtaking countryside, you could imagine. You are truly in the heart of the best Tea estates in the world. The estate itself is an old colonial lodge, beautifully preserved without feeling dated. You can have your meals on the terrace overlooking the mountains, it's truly amazing. 
All of the staff could not be more friendly or helpful. They provide guided tours of the tea fields and tasting. The staff are even willing to guide you on walks up the mountains if you ask. The cooks provide delicious traditional food, but will also make things on request (e.g. my wife doesn't like spicy food, so they were happy to tone this down). All our needs were met. 
The estate comes with great facilities e.g. a pool, tennis court. There is a waterful to visit close by for a more natural dip, and of course the tea fields themselves. Despite being so remote, the Wi-Fi signal is good and is reliable. 
The only issue we encountered were a significant number of ants in our room which could have been avoided.

The à la carte meals were delectable, and we appreciated each one thoroughly. The resort is surrounded by jackfruit trees, enhancing its natural atmosphere.
We stayed in a deluxe room, which was spacious and luxurious, equipped with all necessary amenities for a pleasant stay. The pool was adequately sized for both of us.

It's a new boutique type hotel with just 12 rooms. The rooms and hotel are 'eco/ industrial' in style, the whole place is visually stunning and the staff very lovely. 

We hadn't appreciated just how rural and isolated Udawalawe is, we also stayed over Sri Lankan new year (which seemingly runs for a lot longer than we had expected) and I suspect this impacted our stay. 
I think if we were to go again, we'd maybe stay on one of the main roads, waraka is completely isolated and difficult to walk anywhere and I certainly wouldn't book the half board, udalwalawe rides can book you tuk tuks for short journeys out. 
Although we had a package with massage, evening tea with snack & mocktails - none of these were available during our stay (we assume due to the New Year). 

Please be aware they don't serve alcohol on poya days. 
The resident naturalist Dinuka was very helpful and we really enjoyed the kayaking. 
All staff seemed to be working very hard as we arrived, but there was a lot of confusion over rooms and bookings, it wasn't clear who was booking people in. 

Confusion continued around meals and drinks, times and orders. I can't stress enough just how lovely & accommodating everyone was, but it really felt like the chef, front desk & hotel manager had gone away for the holidays. 
Food took forever to arrive, both in the evening and when lunch was ordered. There seemed to be a lot of rules about what and how to order breakfast, and no clarity on when we could have breakfast (what time is breakfast available) - we were told anytime, but then to be told that we couldn't arrange to have anything kept to one side for after we returned from a 6am safari, only to return, be accommodated & see that seemingly no other guests had been asked to submit an order the previous night and were just ordering as everyone returned from safari about 10am. Imagine my surprise the following morning when we went down at 9.30 to be told we couldn't order the sri Lankan breakfast from the menu only to have it arrive later? The food we had for lunches was absolutely fine, but a lot of what we were given in an evening wasn't edible. Stunning hotel, very kind staff, but restaurant needs some looking at.","Go for the experience but not the food","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d27940388-r1003645762-Waraka_Udawalawe_Thema_Collection-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

I had the pleasure of staying at Cinnamon Red, and I must say that it truly exemplifies the best of Sri Lankan hospitality. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff who were always ready to assist with a smile. The hotel’s central location in the heart of Colombo made it incredibly convenient for exploring the city, yet it still felt like a peaceful retreat after a long day.

A special mention goes to Thiloka at the front desk. Her helpfulness, knowledge, and genuine understanding of guest relations were simply outstanding. She went above and beyond to ensure my stay was as comfortable as possible, providing excellent recommendations and handling every request with grace and professionalism. Thiloka is a shining example of what makes Cinnamon Red such a wonderful place to stay.

If you’re looking for a hotel with exceptional service, a great location, and true Sri Lankan hospitality, Cinnamon Red is the perfect choice.

As someone who makes it a habit to catch up on both national and international news each day, having access to television news is an essential part of my routine no matter where I am.

On the second morning of my stay, I realized that the television in my room wasn’t functioning properly, likely due to poor signal caused by the rainy weather in Colombo. While it was an understandable issue given the conditions, I hoped it could be resolved.

That’s when I met Mr. Gayan, the room boy assigned to the 20th floor, where I was staying. From the very beginning, Mr. Gayan left a positive impression. On my first day, he greeted me warmly in the morning, checked in to see if the room was in order, and made me feel genuinely welcome.

The following day, I happened to see him near the lift and casually mentioned the issue with the TV. Without hesitation and without needing any technical support, Mr. Gayan came to my room and quickly fixed the problem. I was truly impressed by his initiative, skill, and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure guests have a comfortable experience.

It was in that moment I realized how talented and multi-skilled the staff at Cinnamon Red truly are. Mr. Gayan is a shining example of hospitality done right a professional who not only understands his role but embodies the values of care, efficiency, and excellence.

Overall, my stay at Cinnamon Red was truly enjoyable. The food was exceptional, the ambience was refreshing, and above all, the staff were remarkably attentive and genuinely kind. Thanks to people like Mr. Gayan, my stay became a truly memorable one.","A Memorable Stay at Cinnamon Red – Thanks to a Remarkable Employee","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r1014076525-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The pool was nice although the area around it needs a little TLC. The dinner buffet was not as big as some we had experienced but it was fine. The bar had a happy hour 5-7pm and we enjoyed our chat with the friendly barman. For breakfast the lady chef made me a delicious omelette. The bed was comfortable.

While this is a Vivanta, it carries the signature warmth and hospitality that the Taj brand is known for—it felt like a bit of my sister’s hospitality woven into the experience. Yes, the property is a little dated, but it exudes a timeless elegance and comfort that made our stay incredibly pleasant.

From the moment we arrived at Santani, we were welcomed by the calming sounds of birdsong and nature—an immediate sense of peace. The setting is breathtaking, with views of the Knuckles mountain range and the soothing sound of waterfalls creating a truly serene escape.

The culinary experience was outstanding. Chefs Indika Liyanage, Indika Bandara, and Indunil—an incredibly passionate and talented team—curated a unique blend of European, Sri Lankan, and wellness-inspired cuisine. Every dish was made with organic, foraged ingredients, delivering exceptional freshness and flavor.

Service throughout our stay was flawless. The small but dedicated team provided warm, thoughtful hospitality, with a focus on detail and quality that elevated the experience. The well-curated wine list added a perfect complement to each meal.

We immersed ourselves in wellness activities like guided nature walks, morning yoga, and spa treatments that truly redefined relaxation.

Santani is more than just a wellness resort—it’s a place to reconnect with yourself and nature. The tranquility, clean mountain air, nourishing food, and mindful experiences combine to offer a true celebration of life.","A soulful Escape","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r1007504915-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

However, it didn’t feel like detox food or personalized to my needs. The doctor wasn’t very informative or helpful. She is very kind but that is about it. I felt like just another number and not given the attention as an individual. A lot of my requests were ignored and I honestly did not receive the results I was looking for. Even she was shocked that we didn’t get the results that was expected. However, I’m still going to say that the views and the energy of this place is unreal… truly magical. The most magical part and highlight of my stay at Santani was meeting the yoga instructor, Saman. The best yoga I have ever experienced and most challenging. I never felt stronger like I did after Samans yoga classes. He gives such good insight and truly wants to help each individual. He helped me alot with my physical and mental state and I believe I have met a life long friend and healer that I will be forever grateful for. The treatments are also incredible however again did not feel tailored to my physical and mental state. I had to ask for more personalized treatments.

From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the incredible service and the serene, natural setting that made it one of the most memorable hotel experiences we've ever had.

The service here is truly exceptional. Santani went above and beyond to ensure every detail of our stay was perfect. The staff set up a WhatsApp group specifically to cater to our needs, which was such a thoughtful and effective touch. We would especially like to recognize Oshee, who was exceptionally  professional and  helpful. Her warmth and personable approach made us feel welcome and taken care of from the start. She even organized a personal meeting with the chef to discuss our dietary preferences and requirements, ensuring that every meal was just as we wanted it.

The room itself was one of the most visually arresting and peaceful spaces we've ever stayed in. Set in the jungle, it offered the most incredible view we've ever had from a hotel room. The combination of glass and balcony made it feel private yet connected to the surrounding nature. At night, the fireflies and the sounds of the jungle created a magical atmosphere. There was (deliberately) no air conditioning, but this wasn’t a problem at all, as the room’s ventilation was thoughtfully designed and kept the space comfortable throughout our stay.

One of the highlights of our experience was the traditional Ayurvedic spa. The tranquil setting which was open to nature, and the stunning views made it feel like a true escape. We especially loved the hot pool, which was a perfect way to relax and unwind.

The outdoor infinity pool, with its sweeping views of the jungle, was another standout feature. The serene environment was perfect for lounging and gazing out at the lush greenery, truly making us feel at peace with the surroundings.

The food at Santani was sensational. The Sri Lankan dishes were packed with flavor and beautifully prepared, but there were also Western options for those who wanted them. Breakfast was a joy—generous portions, with a variety of choices to satisfy any craving.

We also had the privilege of experiencing yoga sessions with a traditional Hatha yoga instructor. The classes were thoughtful, and practicing in the open Shala, surrounded by the sounds of the rain and jungle, created a deeply special experience that we'll never forget.

A memorable highlight was the guided jungle walk into the Knuckles Mountain Range, led by the hotel's incredibly knowledgeable and passionate naturalist, Osanda. His deep understanding of the environment and ecology made this trek through the remote mountain range an unforgettable adventure. We saw a stunning array of wildlife, including shrub frogs, Sri Lankan jungle fowl, leaf-nosed lizards, mongoose, giant squirrels, egrets, and of course, plenty of leeches! Even though it rained heavily for hours, the experience was so enriching, and Osanda made sure we were safe and well-informed throughout the journey. We also witnessed remote waterfalls in an area that would have been inaccessible without a guide.

Santani Wellness Hotel provided the perfect balance of a peaceful retreat with exceptional service. It was the ideal place to disconnect and rejuvenate, and we were impressed by the thoughtful design of the property that allowed us to experience nature at its best while maintaining the highest levels of comfort. It’s easy to see why Santani has been recognized as one of the best spa hotels in the world—its setting, its service, and its offerings are unparalleled.

Yoga twice a day that can be utilized at any level. I am a doctor and got a Ayverdic consultation from their physicians on staff and that was amazing.

I felt like I really learned a lot. Next time I want to go back and do a weeklong  detox, meet lots of people there who enjoyed their experience. The only part that I found unpleasant was the fact that the restrooms in your hotel room do not have doors on them this is annoying.

The view is spectacular, the place is secluded, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and everyone always has a smile. The food was all excellent too, as were the delectable cocktails- try the one with arrack!

Every night I would come back to a cute towel sculpture on my bed- a rabbit, an elephant, a turtle… always made me laugh. 

I spent hours sitting on my verandah staring at the ocean. 

If you want to get away from the madness, this is for you. Quiet, private, beautiful, calm, and full of a warmth that feels like “home”.

I would like to mention by name a few staff who made my stay so special for me:
Bharatvir - the manager who was knowledgeable, extremely considerate, and knows exactly how to make a good moment better. 
Sandaruwan- always smiling and the artist behind the towel animals.
Ramiz - always so attentive at meals, remembering how I like my coffee and fruits.

We are thrilled to hear that your second stay was just as magical as your first, and that you enjoyed the stunning views, comfortable room, and the impeccable care of our pool man/gardener. We’re especially grateful for your kind words about our staff—they truly make Roman Beach special, and we’re so happy that their warm hospitality made your stay memorable.

We apologize for the issues you experienced with the restaurant on this occasion, and we truly appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We’ll be sure to review our service and work on improving the overall dining experience, including the ambiance in the evening, as we strive to create a perfect atmosphere for our guests.

It’s wonderful to hear that you found time to relax by the pool and enjoy the beautiful sunsets from your balcony. We're so glad that you felt taken care of, even with your early flight, and that our team could offer you a little breakfast for the airport.

We would be absolutely delighted to welcome you back for a third stay! Roman Beach’s personal touch is something we cherish, and we’re grateful that you recognize that. We look forward to seeing you again soon for another unforgettable experience.

Thankfully we were given room 106 again which really does have the most beautiful view! So let’s start with all the positives - Roman Beach is still magical, the room is lovely - gorgeous bathroom with spa bath, comfortable bed and that view! The pool is the perfect temperature and the whole outside area is immaculately kept by their lovely pool man/gardener who will make up a sun lounger in your favourite spot as soon as he sees you and keeps checking in to make sure you are ok! What makes Roman Beach special is its staff - so helpful and just lovely smiley people. We did have a couple of issues though this time, we ate in the restaurant twice for dinner  and both times they got one of the meals wrong - the first time we decided not to say anything because we just wanted to eat together but the second time it happened, we did mention it. They were very upset that they had made a mistake and quick to make another meal but the food sadly wasn’t great - this being said, my husband had the Sri Lankan curry and he said it was delicious. Breakfast seems to be a huge affair and we decided to just go down the street to have a coffee - if you like a big breakfast then this place is for you! Having said that, even though the option for a smaller breakfast wasn’t on the menu, I am confident they would have accommodated this if we asked. Overall the restaurant does lack abit of ambience on an evening, maybe if they dimmed the lights, added candles, nice music and special menu’s it might be more inviting?
We quickly fell into a lovely rhythm of lazy mornings by the pool and afternoons on the balcony watching the glorious sunsets. Whilst RB is not licensed they will go out and get beer/wine for you and one afternoon we ordered a bottle of wine for the balcony for sundowners - bliss!
We left for an early flight and the chef had made us a little breakfast for the airport - really kind! 
So the big question is would we go back for a 3rd time and the answer is a resounding yes! Since we first went to Hikkaduwa some nice high end hotels have popped up with lovely restaurants but RB has a personal touch  that bigger hotels just don’t have come and see for yourself!","2nd time to Roman Beach","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r997192561-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We got an upgrade to King Suite due to our long stay (thank you so much!!) and really loved this room on the 2nd floor. Rooms are clean and (speaking about the Suite) spacious. There are overall 6 rooms (three 1st floor, three 2nd floor). Great pool, makes it possible to train (if you really want to -  during your holidays). Staff is extremely friendly and attentive, Reception, Pool and technical service (thanks, Sugath for preparing the sunbeds every day at the newly built umbrella on the beach) were great, Restaurant service (the two young guys were amazing), Kitchen (we never went out for dinner because the food in restaurant was so good) - the cook was recommending a dish every day -  and surprised us with different preparations. Extra wishes no problem. Manager Warna always had time for a chat and made us feel welcome. 
Please allow us one hint: the Bathroom could be renovated a little bit (for example the blinds between the bathroom and the sleeping room)
It was in a way like being part of the family for those 8 days. Thanks also for the opportunity to stay in the room until the evening of the departure day  - free of charge - this is not a given. Location is a bit outside of Hikkaduwa (roundabout 25 min. beach walk to turtle point) but not too far - Tuk Tuk or even walkintg to the center no problem. Perfect for long walks on the beach.

We head to the northeastern foothills of Lanka’s highest peak Pidurutalagala, A tea factory comes into view overlooking the valley of Mandaramnuwara. And we soon realise that it is our destination. An abandoned tea factory built hundred and seventy-five years ago, during the infancy of growing tea in then Ceylon, now converted into a hotel.
It is mid-day and the Sun peers out of the clouds whisking past touching the mountain ranges. Mist keeps coming in and out giving us a performance as the views open and close. Temperatures feel cool compared to hot and humid planes we left only a couple of hours ago. A lady from the plantation Tamil community welcomes us and invites us to light a lamp and places a red coloured dot of ash on our foreheads, signifying that this is an area where the majority are from the Tamil community. A community whose ancestors were brought by the British from South India to clear the lush primary forests of the hills and plant coffee first and then once coffee was wiped out to plant tea in its place. We then meet the rest of the staff all with welcoming smiling faces and eager to interact with us
While the hotel has no frills, it is cosy and neatly kept. The rooms are spacious enough with views of the valley and rugged mountain peaks.
We had a mix of authentic local and western cuisine during our stay lovingly prepared by Chef Morgan and his team. Sasanka, Ramesh and Randika the stewards and Dumindu in the front office were always at hand to meet our needs. Akash and the rest at housekeeping kept our rooms spotless. What is unique about the place is the mini tea factory complete with the traditional machinery to produce black tea inhouse.  The flavour and aroma of the freshly manufactured tea is hard to beat. In fact, the aroma from the manufacturing process permeates across the hotel adding to the romance of the place. The affable, knowledgeable and versatile naturalist Lakshan doubles up as the person in charge of tea production and we learnt some hitherto unknown facts about growing and manufacturing of black tea from him. He is assisted by Selvaraj, the lovable teamaker. Lakshan accompanied us during our two days of travel in the vicinity experiencing the stunning views and the multitude of waterfalls. The terraced paddy fields and vegetable plots of the valley are still worked the traditional way as the slopes are too steep for machinery.
All in all, the eight of us had a lovely time.

“Here soars our island-summit. Here I stand
In spirit, as in body once I stood
Long years ago, in love with all the land,
This peerless land of Beauty’s plenitude.”

From booking to leaving from hotel was a smooth process without any hassle. You will not realize that it is a hotel until you walk into the premises as it is a tea factory from outside which converted to hotel in 2019. 

The entire team at the hotel was so caring, very help full and attending to every need with no hesitation. Vinoth guided us from the day prior to we visited the hotel. Dinidu went out of his way to help our mother who had difficulties in climbing stairs.

The road to the hotel is not the best but you will have to expect it as it is situated in a tea estate. Recommending using a vehicle with good ground clearance and drive with patience.

You will have a decent spread of food for all three meals, and the kitchen crew is doing a fabulous job to maintain good taste in every dish they offer.

Rooms are spacious and clean. The only drawback is they are not fully soundproof, so you can hear all the noise from outside.

One of the best experiences you could get is to know about a bit of history of tea industry in the world and Sri Lanka. You also can get experience of total orthodox tea manufacturing process from withering to packing. Lakshan is well equipped with knowledge and explains to you about the entire process & clears out any unclear area in the process.","Pleasent Experience","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g18207106-d17790720-r1013073695-Tea_and_Experience_Factory_Thema_Collection-Mandaramnuwara_Central_Province.html",

The booking process was smooth, and I did it online. They have a pretty functional web site and are very responsive with the phone.

Location
It's located in the famous Mandraramnuwara area for its beautiful waterfalls, crazy weather swings, cold climate and beautiful views. The hotel is situated inside a tea state so getting there is bit difficult due to the road conditions, but you can easily negotiate the road even with a small car if you are careful. There were two small cars (Vitz and a Passo) while we were there.

Hotel
It's an old tea factory converted to hotel. The place has lot of history because its one of very first factories built in Sri Lanka in 1800's. There is a functioning tea factory in the same premises.

Welcome
We received a very nice traditional welcome inspired from Hindu culture. We received a pottu on our foreheads at the end of the small ritual. Afterwards we received snacks and Cinnamon infused tea which is produced in the factory next to the hotel.

Accommodation
We booked two rooms which are Sinna Dorei Family and Periya Dorei Family. They can accommodate 3 and 4 people respectively. Rooms had barn doors which are common in industrial facilities. Walls are made of corrugated metal sheets which is very common among tea factories. Walls are double layered probably with some insulation in it. Sound proofing is not great, but we have no complaints. After all it's a tea factory. The room had all the amenities required including an electric heater which is quite good. Tea making facilities a d supplies were available, and all the toiletries were available. The walls were decorated with old posters depicting the history. Both rooms were great and loved it. Mine was in the downstairs overlooking the garden area.

Food
We made our booking on full board basis so stayed for all three meals. Since the hotel partially occupied, we didn't receive a buffet. This was confirmed during the booking, so we were expecting this. The options provided for meals are limited but we found food items matched to our liking in all three meals. The portion sizes were good and filling. We tried pumpkin soup, seafood broth soup, fish balls, salads, baked chicken, fried rice, eggs cooked in various ways (poached, fried etc...), pasta, kottu, backed fish, curd, watalappam, cut fruit, fruit salad during our meals. All were good and tasty. Only complaint is that the kottu was very spicy even for Sri Lankan standards. They replaced it promptly after notifying about it and apologized. The service received during meals were great.

Service
We received excellent service from the hotel staff. The staff was extremely friendly and quite happy to attend to our requests and was ready to provide detailed explanation of the aspects of the hotel we questioned about. Loved the great service from the friendly staff.

Tea experience
They offer a tea experience tour covering every aspect from leaf to cup. Everything starts from tea plucking session. The person in charge of the tour is extremely knowledgeable and provide us details of plucking process and answered our question in very detailed manner. Afterwards the factory visit started. There we got to know lots of details of the tea manufacturing process and the science behind it. They demonstrated all the steps of the process using the machines that are being used for the actual production explaining lots of things going behind the scenes. We got to know how tea is made, how they taste different, how they are graded and so on. The final step is a tea tasting session which was great and visit to the old power room. Don't miss this tour.

During our stay we used the pool table which was nice. Wasn't able to use the nice swimming pool because of the weather. There are a few nice excursions available.

Overall, we loved the stay at the hotel. It's an excellent place for families or groups of friends to have a relaxing time with little adventures and great tea experience.","Breath taking views and great hospitality...","2025-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g18207106-d17790720-r1011869744-Tea_and_Experience_Factory_Thema_Collection-Mandaramnuwara_Central_Province.html",

At this vintage site they had made it possible for us to feel that it was much more than what it was meant to be over a century ago thus converting it to an abode with cozy beds and a restaurant where we could flavour the in-house cuisine and enjoy freshly brewed tea or cocktails from a rustic bar, while giving the patrons a chance to indulge in the manufacture of tea from plucking the fresh leaves to processing, tea tasting and to the point of packing the finished black tea. Our stay was very comfortable in a spacious cabin with important amenities provided to us. At the arrival we were greeted with a traditional “Arti” style welcome with lighted oil lamps followed by placing Thilaka or Bindi or Pottu on the forehead with blessings, followed by the serving of the welcome drink which was a warm cup of Cinnamon infused tea. They cared us with a high level of attention which made us feel that they wanted our visit to be memorable. Their hospitality was greatly appreciated, their staff was extraordinarily nice.  

We had a choice with their dinner and breakfast menus, bar had a few cocktails one special with Sri Lankan arrack and their Kabaragala tea. Room was warm and comfortable for the cooler night. We found it to be very central to numerous waterfalls and lookout points. They had a guided trek to Kabaragala Ella falls listed in their days programme. As we were interested in seeing all the attractions in Mandaram Nuwara precinct in a relatively short duration they assisted us to obtain a 4WD vehicle from an external service provider to travel to these locations.","A nice experience to dwell in an extremely old Tea factory and experience the tea producing process","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g18207106-d17790720-r1004642720-Tea_and_Experience_Factory_Thema_Collection-Mandaramnuwara_Central_Province.html",

Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback! We’re thrilled to hear that your stay at our boutique hotel in Udawalawe exceeded your expectations. It's fantastic to know that our team made you feel special and that you enjoyed the beautiful setting and modern comforts of your room.

We’re glad to hear you appreciated the food and that our staff were able to accommodate your husband’s needs during dinner. Their attentiveness is something we take great pride in, and we’re happy it made a difference for you both.

Dinuka will be delighted to hear your kind words about the village walk. He truly enjoys sharing his knowledge and helping guests connect with the nature around us.

Thank you once again for your generous recommendation. We hope to welcome you back for another memorable stay in the future!

It is a small boutique hotel that has only been open for 6 months and yet you would never know. It feels established with brilliant members of staff who effortlessly make you feel special. It is in a delightful setting. 

Our room was thoughtfully designed and furnished with all modern comforts. It was like being in the jungle but with all mod cons! Even a delightful swimming pool. The food was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Notwithstanding that we had chosen our evening meal my husband didn’t feel quite right having eaten something the day before that disagreed with him so that when we went to dinner he didn’t feel like eating his chosen meal. The staff were so understanding and were more than happy to make him a plain omelette. They were most solicitous and even asked about his well being at breakfast. They could not have been more caring. 

We also went on an early morning ‘village walk’ (which is more of a nature walk) with Dinuka, the resident naturalist. He was charming and so knowledgeable spotting things we would never have otherwise seen. 

We were sorry to leave and cannot recommend it highly enough.","An absolutely amazing place","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d27940388-r997224967-Waraka_Udawalawe_Thema_Collection-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The restaurant team were excellent. Very attentive and the open view to the friendly chefs in the kitchen was a fun addition. 
The riverside setting enabled a great hour of bird spotting - our own bird safari right on the doorstep with sightings of a water monitor, kingfishers, egrets, ibis - a perfect way to while away an hour after breakfast. 
Overall, a very pleasant stay.","A friendly, beautifully sustainable place to stay","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d27940388-r994409313-Waraka_Udawalawe_Thema_Collection-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

Thank you for your wonderful review! We’re delighted to hear that Waraka was one of the best eco-luxury hotels you’ve experienced. It’s great to know you enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere, outstanding service, and stunning room with modern comforts.

We’re also happy that you loved the riverside setting, pool, restaurant, and the beautiful food. It’s fantastic that you had a great time kayaking and biking with our naturalist—his passion for local birdlife truly enhances the experience!

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed our riverside location, the comfortable accommodation, and the warm hospitality of our team. It's wonderful to know that our staff’s efforts, from the gardener to the service team, made a positive impact on your stay.

We’re sorry to hear that our supper didn’t quite meet your expectations, especially given the high standards of Sri Lankan cuisine you’ve experienced elsewhere. Your feedback is invaluable, and we’ll use it to further enhance our dining experience.

We’re thrilled you appreciated the natural setting and bird life during breakfast, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for an even better experience in the future.

We liked it so much that we changed plans after our 4 night stay to return there( after a short side trip to  Yala NP ) for an additional  night there en route to Colombo.
We liked the balcony rooms but be warned there are no lifts at the hotel and we were on the top floor which meant several flights of stairs. Also although we would have liked the jacuzzi bath it was just too big to  get in and out of it safely which was a shame.
Half board did mean a set evening meal which was better some nights than others but breakfast was always good.
We very much liked the friendly and helpful staff at the hotel both on reception and in the restaurant and also particularly Chamara the lifeguard and pool attendant.
What was  useful for us was that the hotel could arrange a driver called Ryan   both to take us to Yala and collect us at a much better price than we had been quoted by both the Yala hotel and the Colombo hotel and he was excellent and very accommodating when we wanted to do a couple of small detours en route namely to go to a local shop selling tea and to go to see Unawatuna town beach .
As mentioned there are tuktuk drivers waiting just 5 minutes from the hotel to get to Galle and Unawatuna etc and after one tuktuk driver kindly took us for free over a very large puddle after a downpour when we were walking to the main road   we took up his offer to take us by car to Colombo and this worked out well.  
We would definitely recommend this hotel  and hope to return one day","Very much liked this hotel","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d3386434-r998307088-CoCoBay_Unawatuna-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We had a warm welcome, and things just got better from there. The restaurant is excellent, serving both snacks and full meals. The menu is extensive and varied with some excellent seafood options.  There is a secluded beach with a very shallow slope into the sea, meaning that it is a long walk out before you are out of your depth.

The beach is not huge, but there is room for everyone, and towels are provided. There is a lifeguard on duty every day. Others have remarked that the hotel is a little tired in places, but this seems to be a problem everywhere after Covid and the recent fiscal crisis in Sri Lanka. The hotel was spotless, and the beach was thoroughly cleaned every day.

If you are looking for 5-star luxury with modern, impressive rooms and communal areas, then this will not be for you. If you want to feel looked after with nothing being too much trouble and somewhere to relax, then this is the place to go.

All the staff were fantastic, nothing seemed to be to much trouble for them. Everyone was extremely friendly and happy to have a chat.
Our room was perfect, very spacious and clean. The balcony was a fantastic size.
We were there on bed and breakfast but ended up eating lunch and dinner as the food was great, lots of choice and so fresh.
It's in a great location, we walked to Galle and also up to Jungle Beach, but there are also plenty of tuk tuks.

Уборка номера производилась каждый день, пополняли мини-бар, каждый день приносили воду и печенье, несколько раз меняли постельное бельё. Удачное месторасположение отеля, отель находится в бухте и складывается ощущение, что вы отделились от городской суеты.
Исходя из выше сказанного, хочется отметить, что в данном отеле чувствуешь себя в безопасности (не смотря на бешеный ритм города). 
Находясь в данном отеле, ощущается тепло и домашний уют, при этом, работа персонала выражает искренность и дает понимание того, что все готовы сделать твой отдых запоминающимся и комфортным (без намека на «чай»).

The food here by the way is immaculate, and it’s no problem to make a special request! My boyfriend booked a private bbq on the beach for dinner for my birthday as well, I can’t explain how good this was, it was so romantic and so perfect. We had our own private chef and private waiter who kept topping our plates up as soon as we’d finished. The food again was incredible, we were spoiled with potato salad, salad and rice, I had vegetable skewers and my partner had chicken and beef, it was so nice listening to the sound of the waves whilst we were eating our dinner. I definitely recommend the private bbq on the beach it was honestly so good and so special! The rooms are spot on, the bed is huge and very comfortable, the bathroom is also HUGE! Nice hot water in the shower and the jacuzzi as well is amazing! You get toiletries topped up daily as well such as shampoo, body wash and conditioner.

Never felt so safe and well taken care of. Slepped like a rock! A gem. Keep it up. Don't miss it.

Ashburnham is one of my favourite locations, and I had a refreshing one-week stay where I got to de-stress and enjoy my days in leisure. 
For the duration of my stay, Ash was like a home away from home, far away from the hubbub, and precisely what I needed. The bungalow itself is large and airy, complete with a fireplace for the cold evenings, and the tea-estate and surrounding hills sprawl away in lush greenery. The rooms are beautiful, and I must admit I enjoyed my siestas. 
The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, and the staff are accommodating to vegan needs (though I suppose a few more vegan items could be added, especially for tea). I highly recommend the black-eyed-peas risotto (made with coconut), and the lunch salads in general were delicious. The staff are also happy to adjust and acquiesce to needs if they have the ingredients (essentially, they allowed me to customise my breakfasts). 
Getting snacks and drinks in a cooler box and spending afternoons by the water is my suggestion. Languid immersions, watching the rainbow as it ascends up the waterfall, and then sunbathing on the warm rocks; doesn't get better than that! The water can be a bit chilly at first if one is not used to mountain rivers, but, then again, this would make it Wim Hof-approved! I certainly found it invigorating, and it became part of my daily ritual in reviving myself.
Quite frankly, reliving the memories makes me want to go right back and spend another week!","A perfect solo retreat in nature","2022-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r836881692-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

Located 40 minutes from kandy and a stones throw from the Knuckles Forrest Reserve, Ashburnham made an idyllic spot to escape the city and experience the beauty of Sri Lanka’s central province. With bike trails, good walks, natural pools and waterfalls to swim in, as well as a tea tour from the enthusiastic Mr Das, all perfectly exhibited this paradisal part of the world. 

The staff here were brilliant - friendly, attentive and helpful which gave the place a really welcoming, homey and relaxed atmosphere. It was great to see the enthusiasm, effort and care put in by the staff (Vish seemingly able to pull G’&T’s out of thin air), especially after Covid and the recent civil unrest in the country. 

My sojourn at Ashburnham has been by far the highlight of my trip to Sri Lanka and my time spent here will stay with me forever.","Mountaintop Shangri-la","2022-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r836862356-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

Beginning from the drive through the hills until you arrive in what felt like a secret garden. The estate is super lush with such an overwhelming sense of tranquility. I spent only 2 nights at a Ashburnham but had my time permitted, I would have gladly stayed for much longer. 

The grounds speak for themselves. But what also made my stay were the exceptional staff and Owner’s. They ensured everything was to my comfort, taking the time to personalise my stay. I can’t thank Amila, Vish and the beautiful family who own the estate enough, for sharing their special sanctuary.

What made the experience more memorable was the amazing staff who are at the bungalow who cater to all our requirements without hesitation and we were very fortunate to also meet the owners who are a lovely family and made us feel very welcome and warm, and made us feel our stay was very homely though we were far away from it....i recommend Ashburnham very highly to anyone or group who is looking for a nice gate away with natural surroundings and a beautiful experience!!

During our stay we realized that Ashburnham is a perfect holiday getaway. 
The bungalow itself is is full of light and very airy and each room is tastefully decorated. We stayed in the balcony room which as the name suggests has its own private balcony with the room. The furnishing are simple and elegant and the whole bungalow has a very homely feel. 

The staff were beyond exceptional; we were looked after by Vish throughout our stay and no ask was too big for him. We were thoroughly pampered throughout our stay of 2 days.

The meals at Ashburnham were an experience in itself . All meals were beautifully prepared and were very tasty . The portions are generous and can even be shared. Being a foodie , quality of meals is very important to me and the chef at Ashburnham did not disappoint; every meal was perfect!

To top off an already perfect stay, Ashburnham has its own private waterfall. We spent the better part of the morning exploring the waterfall and the cascade pools.

Ashburnham is the perfect getaway and is wonderful for a large group of ppl. Would highly recommend to book the whole place to yourself.

The meals which were prepared in the kitchen were excellent!

We had a beautiful room with sea view, the pool was fantastic, the food was the best we've eaten in Sri Lanka, but what made it for us were the staff here were just outstanding. Each and every member of the team worked so hard to make their guests happy. They greeted us with smiles, were helpful and so very friendly. The manager Warna is wonderful, couldn't do enough and we loved our chats with him. Sugath's smiles around the pool, attentive at every moment to us and kind to our daughter, getting drinks, towels and balls for the pool (he even cleaned our tuk tuk rental for us!) Sampath was courteous at meal times, explaining the different dishes and Kalani made us welcome from the start as did all the staff here who helped with our bags and kept our room wonderfully clean, I wish I could name each individually as they all deserve a mention! 

We ate at the hotel as the chef took the time to talk with the guests and he put my mind at rest that he would serve Sri Lankan food that wasn't too spicy for us. The food was wonderful! It was a pleasure to stay and eat here. 
Overall, with only 6 rooms the hotel feels peaceful, it's quiet around the pool and beach, but it's not too far from the main town for the restaurants and shops. Pool is perfect with shady spots during the heat of the day, plenty of sun loungers and right on the beautiful beach. Rooms were bright and spacious with great air con comfy beds and a huge bathroom and balcony. We couldn't have wanted for more. 

Thanks to all of you for making the last 3 nights of our holiday very memorable!

Having been to Sri Lanka many times, this was the first time we had stayed at a boutique hotel.

The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to be on a quieter side of Hikkaduwa, slightly away from the crowds but only a short walk from the bars/ restaurants and shops. It feels very private. 

The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel with gorgeous furnishings, all creating a very cosy, relaxing vibe. The rooms are spacious and bright with an amazing-sized balcony, all with an outstanding sea view. 

The beds are super comfortable and all the room amenities make it feel extra special. The hotel has a high level of cleanliness throughout and the housekeeping staff do an excellent job in the rooms. Attention to detail is superb in all areas. 

 The pool is very well maintained and provided lots of fun for my baby boy. The pool staff, especially Sugath do an excellent job. My baby is still asking for him. His kindness will not be forgotten. Every staff member went above and beyond to make our stay feel extra special. Warune the manager was very attentive, he would go out of his way every day to make sure my family was comfortable. Supan the chef is very talented at what he does. We ate the best food we have ever tasted in Sri Lanka. We recommend the Sri Lankan Curry as it’s absolutely delicious! The restaurant staff were all excellent and again my baby will miss Bhagya, Udshion and Akalanka. Kelanee on reception is very polite and caring. Christi is also a lovely man, we can’t thank him enough for his kindness. The hotel really does have a nice atmosphere and I believe the staff are to thank for this. 

If you are looking for a warm welcome and want to be made to feel like family, do not hesitate to book Roman Beach. You will not be disappointed. We will certainly be back!","A very special stay at Roman Beach","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2456385-r941195164-Roman_Beach-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your feedback and for sharing your experience with us. We’re glad to hear you enjoyed the accommodation, the staff, and the various activities during your stay.

To clarify the situation regarding the transfer, you arrived on November 24th and stayed until the 26th, booking through Booking.com. Upon check-out, you requested assistance with transportation to Nanu-Oya, and Mr. Vinoth, who handles the front desk, arranged a transfer with an external car service for 25,000/=.

However, due to adverse weather conditions, the train service was unavailable that day, which Mr. Vinoth promptly informed you about. You opted to proceed with the journey, and during the trip, you later requested to change the destination to Ella. Mr. Vinoth worked with both you and the driver to adjust the price, reducing it from 48,000/= to 42,000/=. We appreciate your understanding during this adjustment and are glad that you expressed your thanks for the arrangements.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion or misunderstanding during the process. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we will certainly consider it as we look to improve our service. We hope your overall experience was enjoyable, and if you visit us again, we will be more than happy to assist with any future travel arrangements.

Thank you.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback, and we truly appreciate your thoughtful comments. We're glad you enjoyed the breathtaking views, the unique experience of staying in a renovated tea factory, and the educational tour of the tea-making process. It’s always rewarding to hear that our guests appreciate the opportunity to learn about the ""Leaf to Cup"" journey!

We do want to address a few of the points you raised:

Soundproofing: We completely understand your concern regarding the soundproofing, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. As part of our efforts to provide an authentic tea factory experience, we’ve used tin sheet partitions to preserve the essence of the original structure. While this gives a unique, rustic touch to the property, we recognize that it may not provide the level of soundproofing that some guests expect. Some guests enjoy this as part of the overall experience, but we truly appreciate your feedback and will continue to explore ways to improve comfort in this area.

No TV in rooms: Our decision to keep TVs out of the rooms is part of our broader vision to immerse our guests in nature and the serenity of the environment. We want visitors to fully disconnect and focus on the natural beauty surrounding us, as well as the tea-making experience. That being said, we understand that this might not suit everyone's preferences, and we apologize if this was inconvenient for you.

Meal Service and Portion Sizes: We’re happy to hear you enjoyed the meals and the food quality, but we do apologize for the service-related issues you mentioned. We will be sure to review the attentiveness of our staff during meal times, especially regarding the bread basket and the portion sizes for breakfast.

You have to drive about 5km  up a narrow mountain road which can be challenging for inexperienced drivers. It worth it for the views . Reception staff and security were very helpful. We stayed in ground floor rooms and the views were wonderful and we liked the decor. The rooms were very clean and good size. Meals are served alacarte with choices and 3/4 courses and the food was good. They gave us an educational tour of the tea making process which we really liked and was informative.

Cons : 
-Beware there are no actual walls just separators between rooms so there is ABSOLUTELY no soundproofing. Conversations could be heard clearly from the next room.
- No TV and poor lighting 
- They kept asking us the exact times we were supposed to arrive at the hotel and when we were coming for meals which was a bit of a hassle.
- Portion sizes were not adequate for breakfast, did not refill bread basket and our server was not very attentive or helpful.

Overall good hotel for a peaceful stay and beautiful views, but considering the cons it’s a bit overpriced.","Wonderful location on top of a hill, but bit overpriced for the facilities","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g18207106-d17790720-r977886316-Tea_and_Experience_Factory_Thema_Collection-Mandaramnuwara_Central_Province.html",

The food was excellent, and the hospitality of the staff was exceptional, making our stay truly memorable.

While the winding road leading to the hotel is fairly maintained, its narrowness adds a bit of challenge to the drive. However, the journey is absolutely worth it. This location is perfect for nature lovers and birdwatchers, and a drive to Kabaragala Falls is a must-do experience.

One note: since the property is a renovated tea factory, the soundproofing in the rooms isn’t ideal.

We tried the sunrise and sunset yoga, which was varied and good for all levels, and with the background noise of the jungle it’s really something special.  The spa looks out to the forest and lake - like something out of a magazine. The team couldn’t do enough for us, always on hand to answer questions, bring drinks and snacks to the pool, make sure your meal met every dietary requirement and was different and varied every day.

It was our first time in Sri Lanka, and we were drawn to the promise of refined elegance amidst raw nature. The experience, for the most part, lived up to its reputation.
        The hotel’s design was ethereal, with twenty buildings discreetly nestled in the forest, a stunning hilltop restaurant, and a secluded spa area. Every detail seemed meticulously crafted to immerse guests in the untamed beauty of the surroundings while cocooning them in comfort. The service at Santani Wellness was exceptional, with every staff member radiating warmth and hospitality. The chef, in particular, was a maestro—each meal over the two days was nothing short of spectacular.

       However, there was one glaring exception that left a sour taste, even after we checked out. The spa manager, an Indian woman with black-framed glasses who exuded an air of elegance and intellect, left us with an unsettling impression. We first encountered her in the restaurant, where she made a point of engaging with every table, enthusiastically recommending the spa and treatments—except ours. We brushed it off at the time. Later, when we visited the spa after booking treatments, she handed us a form to fill out, barely making eye contact, her attention seemingly absorbed by her nails. We couldn’t help but notice that in the restaurant, she continued to greet and chat with every guest—except us. It was as if we were invisible, even in the open, airy dining space. The contrast became starkly apparent when I returned to the spa and witnessed her interacting with a white male guest, patiently explaining each detail of the form with a warmth and attentiveness we had not been afforded.
        The disparity left us wondering: Did she dislike Chinese guests? Was it our skin color or some other bias that made her reluctant to serve us? I feel compelled to remind her that her behavior is a disservice to the hotel she represents. Moreover, as her own government actively encourages Chinese tourism to Sri Lanka, her actions are not only unprofessional but also profoundly ignorant.","A Blemish on an Otherwise Perfect Canvas","2025-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r991730458-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The central dining and sitting area was spacious and comfortable and the quality of the food was very good. This is definitely a retreat for Yoga and Spa enthusiasts and for walkers. In poor weather ( which we experienced ) it can feel rather remote. If you are going to use the Spa facilities think about taking a package as the individual price of treatments was much higher than we had experienced in other locations. We took a guided walk with their naturalist guide and it was very enjoyable- they helped us with special socks to avoid leeches which are pretty much part of the local habitat when it is wet- don’t be put off by that though!

As a travel agent , I had very good clients of mine here the year before, they still talk about Santani now, so I was incredibly excited to stay for myself.

Santani is a wellness centre like no other , it really is something that will stay with you forever.

The architecture & design beautiful and totally in keeping with the stunning views & location. 

Some of the most top notch staff I have come across in the industry from the onsite naturalist to the chefs , it’s like Santani has found the best of the best to ensure you are well looked after. 

The location is serene , the perfect place to unwind & de stress. 

Spa treatments are out of this world, possibly the best treatment I have ever had, I continue to keep trying to find another as good , but each time I am met with disappointment. 

Santani offer a great range of activities, I booked one of their walks down to the river.

I have saved the best until last … the food! 
I still day dream about the food  , it’s out of this world ! I have eaten in some really amazing restaurants & hotels over the years but  again Santani had raised the bar once more. 

If you are looking for a stay that is truly unique, whether you are looking to destress, detox or just take life at a slower pace in luxury surroundings you need to stay at Santani , a truly transformative  experience.","A stay out of this world","2024-10","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r985640437-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

By the time I left, I had shed my physical form and was floating above the valley as a sentient, mindful cloud.

Let me explain.

From the moment I checked in, I felt like I’d stumbled into the set of a spiritual sci-fi epic. The hills whispered secrets older than time. My room was so minimalist that I feared disturbing its zen-like harmony by blinking. The silence was so profound I could hear my soul doing yoga stretches.

The food? It wasn’t just a meal; it was a culinary cleanse. One bite of the beetroot salad, and I swear my chakras aligned like planets in a solar eclipse. Each dish was prepared with such precision and subtlety that I considered enrolling in a monastery to learn the art of soup meditation.

The spa. Oh, the spa. A therapist touched my back and unknotted problems that began in my past life. At one point, I may or may not have met a Yogi Goat who told me to “let go of my earthly worries.” I did. I released them into the mountains like confetti.

On my final day, as I stood in a bathrobe staring dramatically into the mist, I swear the clouds winked at me. A bird landed nearby and gave me a knowing nod, as if to say, “You get it now.”

In summary: Santani is not a hotel. It is an enlightenment factory. A place where stress dissolves, gravity becomes optional, and even the furniture feels more self-actualized than you. I now live on air, vibes, and the occasional memory of that quinoa bowl.

In hindsight, I would strongly recommend at least two nights—three if you have the time—to fully experience what Santani has to offer. Kandy was our penultimate stop during our 10-night Sri Lanka itinerary, and Santani promised the perfect respite we needed at this stage. While the setting and aesthetic were truly breathtaking, our experience was marred by a series of frustrating inconsistencies and service failures.

Unfortunately, our 06:37 am train from Ella was cancelled, forcing us onto a later train, which delayed our schedule and caused us to miss the lunch service at Santani. Although we provided a heads-up about our ETA, we were informed that only sandwiches and fruit could be offered for lunch upon arrival. I pleaded for a hot meal after a 6-hour journey but was met with a firm no. While I understand the need for structure around meal times, the lack of flexibility felt unnecessarily rigid, especially given that lunch was included in our package. It was a bitter start to an otherwise promising stay.

For each meal, we were offered two menu options: Western or Sri Lankan. A chef consultation was arranged to tailor the menu to our dietary requirements—my husband is gluten-free and does not eat red meat. The concept of personalisation sounded wonderful in theory, but the delivery fell far short. At dinner, the meals differed from what we discussed earlier, and when we questioned this, we were told certain items contained gluten. My husband’s dessert, for example, was swapped from Sri Lankan pancakes to a makeshift fruit salad—hardly the bespoke experience promised. At breakfast, they served granola containing gluten and suggested my husband “just eat a little,” as if his dietary restriction were a mere preference. This was not only disappointing but also felt deeply unprofessional. Additionally, previously requested items like a Sri Lankan omelette and mixed fruit smoothie were either forgotten or met with bizarre responses like “eat this first, and we’ll bring another.”

The grounds and chalet were stunning, and the views from our Mountain View Chalet, for which we paid an additional $40 upgrade, were well worth it. The serenity and natural beauty are Santani’s greatest strengths. We also had 90-minute Ayurvedic treatments, which were very relaxing. However, there was inconsistency here too—my husband received the promised consultation with the doctor before his treatment, while mine skipped the consultation entirely. The lack of uniformity was frustrating and detracted from the wellness experience.

Finally, as we were checking out at 12 noon and couldn’t stay for lunch (which begins at 12), we requested a packed meal. I specifically asked for a salad alongside my sandwich, but we were instead given fruit—again, an instance of Santani failing to meet basic expectations.

Individually, these lapses in service might not seem terrible, but collectively, they erode the sense of luxury and wellness that Santani strives to provide. While the setting is undeniably beautiful and offers moments of calm, the numerous inconsistencies and lack of attention to detail left us feeling underwhelmed. Santani has the potential to be truly exceptional but must address these service failings to meet the standard it claims to uphold.","Stunning Views but Inconsistent Service at Santani","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r982781838-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The views are unparalleled—you can easily lose yourself watching how a cloud slowly drapes over a mountain, transforming the landscape within minutes. The attention to detail is exquisite, and the food follows an Ayurvedic principle known as 'Rasa Haya,' which translates to six tastes, ensuring your body receives nutrition tailored to its specific needs.

I stayed on a leisure basis for several days, but Santani also offers a range of wellness packages designed to meet individual goals, such as weight loss, better sleep, or detoxification. There are numerous activities to enjoy in the surrounding nature, but you can also spend your day unwinding in the three-layered spa, which offers a serene escape through its beautifully designed spaces dedicated to relaxation, hydrotherapy, and rejuvenation.

Since my return, Santani has helped me to prioritize my well-being in ways I hadn’t before. I've always found it challenging to commit to activities like meditation or yoga, often viewing them as somewhat repetitive due to my fast-paced lifestyle. However, this perception has shifted since my stay. The resort’s unique ability to encourage mindful living, paired with its thoughtful design, genuinely touched me and left a lasting impact.

I want to personally thank Vickum, the visionary founder behind this inspiring project, for making me pause, reflect, and rethink my approach to self-care. Never did I imagine waking up at 6 a.m. to start my day with a 7 a.m. yoga class. The minimalist architecture and calm ambiance of the resort immediately prompt you to slow down and connect with the present moment—something that isn’t just a cliché but a lived reality here.

Santani’s mindful approach to hospitality and its commitment to creating a sanctuary for relaxation and reflection are incredibly necessary in today's world. It’s more than just a stay; it’s a transformative experience that resonates deeply and stays with you long after you’ve left.","A Transformative Experience at Santani Wellness","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12239236-d10521858-r968963674-Santani_Wellness_Kandy-Werapitiya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The room was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably furnished, with everything I needed for a pleasant stay. I especially appreciated the attention to detail and the effort to create a welcoming environment. The food was another highlight—delicious, fresh, and with a good variety to suit all tastes.

That said, a few areas could use some improvement. The Wi-Fi connection was a bit inconsistent at times, and a few more vegetarian options on the menu would be appreciated. Also, the poolside could benefit from a few more shaded lounging areas.

Overall, EKHO Surf exceeded my expectations. It’s an ideal place for both relaxation and adventure, and I would gladly return. Thank you for making my stay memorable and enjoyable.

The service at Postcard is phenomenal: the staff is always very polite and friendly, and the management is very helpful. I would like to extend a special thanks to Bharatvi, Tuhin, and Ajith, who went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We received so many beaches, tourist spots, and restaurants recommendations. They also always offered to call a tuk-tuk or taxi to take us wherever we wanted. Since Uber works relatively well in Sri Lanka, we almost always opted to call a tuk-tuk or taxi ourselves. We only arranged airport transfers through the hotel upon arrival and departure, which went smoothly.

The hotel overlooks a lake and a beach. However, it is not advisable to swim in the lake, and unfortunately, the hotel does not offer any activities such as kayaking or stand-up paddle. Furthermore, the beach is too far from the hotel and not worth visiting, as it is dirty, small, and the rough sea keeps swimmers away. On the other hand, the hotel has a nice pool to lounge by, but does not have enough sun loungers: only 3, when there should be at least 4 given the hotel's capacity. 

My suggestion to the hotel is to purchase (at least) two kayaks so that guests can better enjoy the lake, as well as an extra sun lounger for the pool area.","Phenomenal service, scenic setting, yet areas for improvement","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8474349-d8472781-r937886906-The_Postcard_Galle-Gintota_Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The private sitting area outside the room opened out into a verandah which overlooked the pool, lush greenery and then the sea - just ideal to lounge with a book or play board games so one didn't mind the unseasonal rain on some days. Being greeted with smiles by every single staff member was a delight. Bharat, the manager, was most helpful and did all he could to ensure our stay was truly memorable. A 15-minute drive to the Galle Fort made it easy to access the hustle-bustle of the more 'touristy' area when we wanted. Half an hour away was Unawatuna's gorgeous beaches with water sports, as well as the hidden Jungle Beach. Anytime breakfast and easy late checkout were the icing on the cake - just perfect for laid back travellers like us.

Service and staff here are top notch, detailed & attention oriented.  Room was immaculate, they did a turn down service, cleaned & cool the rooms before bed.  What a luxury. Breakfast is served at anytime of the day which was so helpful to us as we went whale watching which took 5hours+ & the hotel served us breakfast at 1:30pm.  They turned down our room, and we had a nap afterwards.  Beautiful surroundings and gorgeous view and a pool to cool down in.  Children friendly  - as we had 3 kids with us.  Hotel manager came and spoke to us and made us feel welcome, even the security guards were helpful and friendly, lighting our paths from car to inside.  We always ended the evening with drinks and games.  We had massages to rejuvenate, too. This has to be the highlight hotel of our trip.  Not at the fort area, which was too loud & touristy,  but not too far to go to for a visit or dinner. I have no complaints, not even about pressure of the shower!

And stayed at various resorts in different cities. Galle was our last destination before heading to Colombo for our flight back home. Our stay at Postcard was amazing. It is not a 5 star resort but the property is extremely well furnished, the rooms are super comfortable, the lobby is warm and cosy, the food is beyond excellent and the staff including the manager are super hospitable and always smiling and willing to help you. The property is a huge bungalow with annexe and nice lobbies, hallways, garden , and swimming pool and outdoor sitting area with very artistic furniture and accessories. Lovely to just relax here for 2 days and enjoy the food and the pool. The Chef was amazing and accommodated our request to cook food for us which was not on the menu. The manager was superb and always attentive and pleasurable to talk to. However, I think the 2 years of Covid have had an impact on the property and repairs and upkeep are required here and there. Like the billiard area and the outside garden bar was not operational and the deck down at the lake also required significant repairs. I think the management is aware of this and before the busy season starts in November they should get these areas and others repaired and operational. Overall a wonderful experience and will comeback again.","Best in class - home away from home","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8474349-d8472781-r904311713-The_Postcard_Galle-Gintota_Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

There are nice views to the ocean etc but one cannot really walk to it from the property easily.  The food menu was a bit limited but understandable considering it is a small hotel, and unfortunately when we were there the cook was ill so they got a local person to cook and the food was fine, just limited choices.  The prices of alcohol were reasonable for this type of hotel.  Overall it's a very nice hotel in terms of decor and the building, but there is so much competition in hotels in the area that score highly on food, location and decor.

The pool was nice and spacious, though we had an odd experience where the towel attendant questioned our swimwear. After explaining that our long-sleeved swim shirts were designed for swimming, we were allowed to use the pool. Everything was clean, even though the property could use some remodeling, and the buffet was decent, though not the highlight of our trip. Maybe we were spoiled by the other buffets during our trip, but the selection in this one was pretty good as well.

It’s as if you’ve stepped back in time to the 1930’s.  This tastefully renovated Colonial Tea Plantation house commands a magnificent position looking out over the valley below. The view is nothing short of breathtaking. The hotel gardens are lovingly maintained by their small team of gardeners and the setting is peaceful and relaxing. The Tea Plantation tour and tea tasting with Mr Das is a must. 

Don’t come here expecting the trappings of a modern city centre hotel. The rooms are comfortable but reflect the 1930’s period style. There’s no air conditioning, mini bar, satellite TV and so forth. The sole concession to the 21st Century is the availability of WiFi for those desperate to stay connected to the modern world. 

The service is friendly and attentive. The food is excellent and, although the menu choice is limited, there’s always something to suit most palates. The lunch and dinner offerings change daily depending upon what ingredients are available at the market so what you get is always fresh and imaginative. Breakfasts are excellent also.

I’ve given it a 4 rather than 5 due to a few issues below: 

1. The random selection of plastic clothes hangers that were provided in the room were totally out of keeping with the character of the property. There’s no excuse for not providing a matching set of wooden hangars.

2. Very limited selection of alcoholic drinks available especially spirits.

3. All the prices are in U.S. dollars. Why? It makes no sense at all especially as the majority of the clientele are from the U.K.

4. Their website needs updating. I had expected to have a cooking class with the chef, Reggie only to find that Reggie had left a year previously. I did attend a ‘class’ with the new chefs but it was more like a demonstration that a cooking class and instead of the advertised 2.5 hours it only lasted an hour. Disappointing.

5. The safe in the room was not secured to anything which rendered it somewhat pointless.

That said, it is still a lovely place to stay and would stay again if returning to Sri Lanka","Stunning location ","2020-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r750164269-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

The accommodation is a quaint 6 bedroom guesthouse which oozes Sri Lanka beauty and charm. Our room overlooked the veranda which boasts incredible views out onto the tea plantation. The room was perfect and we had a fantastic night sleep. 

The staff are very welcoming and hospitable and go out of their way to provide fresh iced teas, serve afternoon tea and cake down near the pool and offering summer hats for shade from the hot sun.

The guesthouse offers evening 3 course meal for $20 which a choice of food (unsure of food offered at lunch). We enjoyed an evening meal there and the food was AMAZING! I had a piece of tallabut (unsure of spelling) fish and I think this is the best fish I’ve ever eaten, absolutely delicious.

Which should tell you enough. But let me elaborate:
First of all the location: Far away from any major city it is located within a Tea Plantation. The terrace overlooks the valley which already impresses upon arrival. The noisiest thing you will hear will be the birds chirping around you. 
The rooms have a lot of charisma. Not a single rooms looks like another and each one of them has their own little twist.
The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. May it be regarding your food or arranging activities for you.
The food is plenty and reasonably priced. Consider the fact that it has to be brought all the way there unless they can grow it in their vegetable garden on the property.
My purpose of this visit was to relax. And Ashburnham is ideal for that. I did not spend all day on the terrace doing nothing, mind you. Having their own waterfall on the estate is a huge bonus. And it is not one of those little springs that some hotels falsely call a waterfall. It is a proper one. It invites to explore up- and downstream. With a guide or by yourself. Go for a swim or simply hang out around it and enjoy the sounds of the rushing water.
If you prefer a mountain bike tour, some hiking or would love to learn more about the tea, there is plenty of activities to choose from. I promise, you won't be bored. 
If the weather turns bad, grab a book and make yourself comfortable in front of the fireplace in the common area. 

In summary: I loved how this hotel is different from many. You step in and are not overwhelmed with a massive reception area but with an honest boutique-style hotel. Perfect to wind down and relax but at the same time be active if you wish.
A little tip: If you are thinking of spending a couple if nights there, add an extra one. You will not regret it!","Perfect place to actively relax","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1193319-d1186379-r742351084-Ashburnham_Estate-Elkaduwa_Central_Province.html",

From checking in to checking out ,everything is faultless . The reception staff are polite, helpful and always smiling .
There are comfortable loungers facing the sea and only steps from the pool , a plentiful supply of clean beach towels always at hand  supplied by the smiling life guard 
We opted for the half board basis for our stay . We were not disappointed . Breakfast was an excellent start to the day, fruit juice ,fruit platter ,pastries and then a choice of the cooked options . There was also a wide selection for the evening meal . all delicious . The chef was always on hand with advice and help . Would always ask if there was anything we would especially like

We were not disappointed. We booked a private pool room, which was lovely. We also had our own jacuzzi in the bathroom. And as well as our own pool we were right on the beach.
The staff here are warm, friendly and so welcoming.
I really didn't want to leave. It's a bit of a way from Colombo, but well worth it, and the hotel has their own driver for a small fee.
The restaurant onsite is amazing. We had the set menu included in our booking price and I wasn't sure if i would be glad of it as set menus are usually cheap and nasty, but oh my word, their set menus were different every day and basically 5 courses and delicious. It was pretty much fine dining on the beach. The seafood every night was fresh and amazing.
 We usually go out to other restaurants, but this place had us hooked every night.
You won't be disappointed with this resort, its boutique size, warm and welcoming and the staff treat you like family.
I found that having a smaller size resort made you feel right at home and cared for unlike all the big resorts all around the world.
It's also just a short tuk tuk ride from all the historic attractions of Galle fort and the shopping.
Try this place you will not be disappointed, and you will want to come back again and again.

The original hotel we had planned to stay at had to cancel a day before our arrival due to unavoidable reasons. 
The hotel itself has only 6 rooms so there is an air of privacy and you feel like you have the whole place to yourself. The rooms are very large and spacious and have a beautiful view of the beach. The hotel is located on a relatively uncrowded part of the beach, and a short walk will lead you to the restaurants and bars.
Food was exceptional and frankly of a much higher standard than we expected. The staff also must be commended for their courteousness and attention to detail. Both Pasan and Chathuranga went the extra mile to make our stay that much more enjoyable. Sugath, who helps with maintenance also was extremely kind to us and our daughter.

Lots of space, beautifully decorated, wonderful bathroom and a gorgeous balcony to sit on and watch the sunset. Only six rooms in the hotel so every room had a similarly wonderful view. The location is great. Directly onto a lovely beach and a short walk along the beach to a large number of beach bars and restaurants. Lovely pool and a very relaxing pool area to chill out in. Wonderful breakfasts. Staff were amazing and special mentions to Bhagya who sorted breakfasts and pretty much anything else we needed, the manager Waruna who chatted to us every morning offering up suggestions when we told him of our likely plan for the day, and Sargatha who kept the pool area and gardens in amazing condition. Everyone was lovely. Everything was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble. This is how every hotel should be!

Der Koch versteht sein Handwerk und kocht internationale Gerichte sowie Srilankische Spezialitäten. Der Hotelmanager ist immer vor Ort und kümmert sich um das Wohl seiner Gäste. Einzig die Aperokarte muss man noch überarbeiten, wenn jemand Lust auf einen Drink hat und nicht gerne Bier ist die Auswahl eher bescheiden.

Vielen Dank für Ihre Bewertung. Wir wissen das sehr zu schätzen, da wir ein familiengeführtes Unternehmen sind und ständig daran arbeiten, uns zu verbessern.

Wir werden auf jeden Fall an den Handtüchern arbeiten und diese so schnell wie möglich ersetzen.

Bezüglich der Preisgestaltung ist es eine schwierige Entscheidung, denn wir sind stolz darauf, ein gutes Verhältnis von Personal zu Gästen zu haben, damit unsere Gäste immer rundum verwöhnt werden. Da die Lebenshaltungskosten weltweit gestiegen sind.

Da die meisten unserer Waren importiert werden und unser Talent ein wichtiges Kapital ist, müssen wir unsere Mitarbeiter entlohnen.

Darüber hinaus haben wir angesichts der Covid-Pandemie und der Wirtschaftskrise hart daran gearbeitet, viele Renovierungsarbeiten durchzuführen.

Wir verstehen auf jeden Fall, dass wir einige kleinere Ergänzungen vornehmen können, und wir arbeiten mit Sicherheit daran!

Trotzdem vielen Dank für Ihre Bewertung.

Wir hoffen, dass Sie uns noch einmal besuchen, um den Unterschied im Angebot von Roman Beach zu sehen.

Bitte schreiben Sie uns eine E-Mail, wenn Sie Vorschläge haben!

The hotel is really well thought out and rooms are beautifully & sympathetically designed.
The welcome was warm, service excellent and food was fantastic… best so far in Sri Lanka!! The way they have built this new boutique hotel (opened just 5 months ago) from scratch with maximum upcycling and use of reclaimed materials whilst at the same time achieving such amazing results really is something to behold. Just one suggestion would be to double or triple the lighting in the bedrooms which can be a little difficult to see in! However… doesn’t detract from the fact that I would definitely stay here again and, if the other Thema group hotels are a patch on this and reflect what’s in the brochure… would include them too.

We stayed in the attic suite, which boasted charming decor and was impeccably clean. The air conditioning worked perfectly, ensuring our comfort during our stay. The bathroom had a unique outdoor feel, with a shower that added a touch of nature to our experience.

Dining was a highlight of our stay. The breakfast and dinner offerings were excellent, showcasing fresh ingredients and delightful flavors. While the wait time for food was longer than average, we appreciated that everything was cooked to order, which made it worth the wait.

The pool provided a refreshing retreat, though it was slightly cold. Fortunately, the hot tub was a fantastic complement, allowing us to warm up whilst the children played of the hammock swings.

WiFi was reliable throughout the hotel, which was a nice bonus. 

My husband and son highly recommend a trip to the spa, where they indulged in the head, back, and neck experience—an absolute must-try.

One thing to note is that the rooms aren't soundproof, allowing the natural sounds of the surroundings to seep in. This might not be ideal for everyone, but it certainly enhances the connection to nature.

Overall, it is a fantastic retreat for those seeking peace and relaxation and made a nice change to our usual hotel stays.","Hidden gem","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d27940388-r973967700-Waraka_Udawalawe_Thema_Collection-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

We’re truly touched by your kind words and thrilled that you and your family enjoyed the Sri Lankan hospitality, the peaceful surroundings, and the personal touches from our team.

 The staff are what makes this place truly special-nothing is too much trouble and they always go out of their way to ensure guests have a pleasant stay. The food is top notch and the head chef is so very passionate about his craft - always taking the time to gather direct feedback and even sharing his cooking skills via a live demonstration! The kids really enjoyed this! 

The resort is beautifully managed and the pool is great to unwind in. 

Ive travelled to a few places but non have the same warmth and friendly nature as this hotel. Being a boutique hotel with 12 rooms it's unlikely to be overcrowded which is a nice plus. The family rooms were great to be able to accommodate our children and us in one room. 

Waraka have a number of sustainability initiates as well but what caught my attention was the commercial partnership with the local community all the way from fresh produce, to the staff being picked from the community and trained, it's very special and it really is a very respectable model-this place has left an impression on our family.

We booked the Walawa Suite (quadruple) and a double room. We were given a warm welcome on arrival at the front office by Nadeeka and Hiruni and was ushered to the lobby. Thereafter we were treated to a refreshing cool “beli mal” drink. 
Initially I thought since it’s a small property there wasn’t much we could do in this property but we were all proven wrong. 
We had lunch and there was only 3 options for the main course since there were only a few people for lunch. However, the lunch tasted really good with amazing flavors. 
We were also greeted by the naturalist;  Dinuka who is very friendly, keen and knowledgeable about his subject. You can book a safari to Udawalawe National Park with him. 
Afterwards, we checked in to the rooms, they have taken maximum use of the space and the double room also had a small balcony. They were well maintained and spotless, equipped with all necessary amenities. Bandara does an amazing job in maintaining the rooms. 
The suite was very spacious facing the pool with a large balcony, lounge chairs and a jacuzzi. We were also welcomed by the manager by Mr. Dilshan who talked to us about the back story of the property. He was very friendly and asked us to let him know any requirements. 
After the long journey, we had a dip in the pool facing the river and relaxed in the outdoor jacuzzi next to the pool. 
For dinner, there was a variety of choices in the menu and it had something for everyone. The balcony in the suite was very relaxing with the cool wind blowing from the river so we requested dinner to the room. The dinner was flavorful and 
I was pleasantly surprised with a birthday cake also. Lalith and Aruna ensured that our four course dinner was brought separately even though it was a hassle for them to bring it upstairs several times. 
We woke up early next morning as we were keen on kayaking. We were given life jackets and explained the basics of kayaking by Lalith who also accompanied us. We had a great time for about an hour even though it was our first time and we were so glad that we did it. 
Afterwards, we had a hearty, delicious breakfast with both western and Sri Lankan cuisines. All the meals we had were well seasoned and balanced, thanks to kitchen staff along with chefs for the delicious food.
 However, In future, I would suggest to expand your menu with more choices in main courses and deserts. 
After another swim in the pool and a nap it was time to check out. On our way back we visited the elephant transit home which is just a few minutes away from the hotel. 

Overall, through my experience, I would say we had a relaxing vacation and we were well taken care of by the staff. The staff is the core in any business, specially in hospitality. Therefore, kudos to the staff for ensuring that you offer amazing customer satisfaction and building a good perception about thema resorts.

But our correspondence with the hotel manager Suraj Chhetri assured us that we would be well taken care of and we went ahead. We are so glad we did!
Everything about the hotel is pleasing - its architecture (old colonial with teak pillars and four-poster beds), location (overlooking an estuary and the sea), the vibe (sun-dappled, breezy balconies with chaise lounges), food (curated, local and global favorites), and most important - the service!! Without being intrusive the staff is helpful and eager to make your experience a most pleasant one! The hotel is best for those who seek quiet and serenity - think of catching up on your reading while intermittently dozing off while gazing at the distant sea! If you seek some excitement then the Galle heritage precinct is just 15 minutes away! We particularly commend Suraj Chhetri, chef Abhijeet who curated each meal as per our taste, dining room staff Ajith with his many helpful tips, and all the rest of the staff too.

To start with, the hotel is a lovely property. It's set in a well-maintained colonial villa right on the water. Although you can't access the beach directly from the hotel due to an estuary, there's an access from the village nearby. 

The villa isn't in Galle proper, but a village called Gintota that's a short drive (5-7 minutes away). The hotel can arrange a tuk tuk for you, should you wish to go into town. The location is perfect - you're close enough to town should you wish to see the sights, but also have the peace and quiet of the outskirts.   

The villa has only 10 rooms, which are well appointed with air-conditioning, a four poster bed, a desk, a seating area, and a large bathroom. The rooms overlook the courtyard, which has a few sunbeds and a swimming pool. 

We ate all our meals at the dining room, and were not disappointed. The food is cooked fresh, and the chef made sure to personally check on the meals. I highly recommend the hoppers for breakfast, and the local fish or prawn curry. 

The best part of our stay, however, was the service. All the staff are extremely helpful. Special shout out to the manager Suraj, who made sure our stay was comfortable and took care of all requests. Ajith at the dining room was also extremely helpful, and is a great resource if you need any local information. 

Overall, a great hotel, and thank you very much to the team at the Postcard Galle for an absolutely lovely stay.","Lovely villa hotel and service","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8474349-d8472781-r833268633-The_Postcard_Galle-Gintota_Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

If you are looking for a large splashy resort with swim-up bars in the pool or organized programs for the kids look elsewhere.   

The Postcard is a unique ten-room boutique luxury hotel located on the top of a bluff overlooking the Indian Ocean.  Words can not adequately describe how beautiful the grounds, public areas, and high-end accommodations are maintained and decorated.

Everything is a feast for the eyes with tons of small details that embody the local culture and history of Sri Lanka.  The furniture is colonial, the artwork is full of the colonial past with interesting colors and very playful.  Take the time to absorb the furnishings and places to curl up and read a book preferably a real book with paper.

What sets this gem apart is the staff led by Mr. Ranjan Rai.  Ranjan and his team ensure every detail of your stay is customized to your individual preferences.   He will go out of his way to make sure you will feel at home and provide a level of service unheard of in today's hectic world.   

Special mentions must go to Chef Abhijit Khandual who made several items that were not part of the menu and customized my meals to my preferences.  Each day he would ask for my dinner choices so that he could time my dinner to my schedule.  All items are freshly prepared with the finest local ingredients and you could taste the love in everything he created.

Another member of the team that went above and beyond was Ajith Kumara.  Ajith provided tips to make sure we experienced the best of the local area.  He constantly spoke with us to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  

If you are looking for a unique experience that will blow you away without compromising comfort, value privacy, and enjoy an environment that is culturally exceptional,  paradise can be found at The Postcard - Galle, Sri Lanka.

The design team needs to take another look at the flow of the room) . Ranjan was a great manager steering the hotel out of Covid though. I’m sure it was a huge task.
Considering they had just reopened a month before after being shut for Covid, everything was running very well. The chef and rest of the team were the loveliest people as well. We enjoyed seeing them everyday.

Such a bliss and location. Natural spa with flowers from the tree. Just short of words. we have been to the postcard for sometime now. It was within india though. each property is exotic. hence we got the courage to try galle property in omnicron tooo. First of all its hospitality redefined. starting with satvik - he was amazing to coordinate with us until we arrived- he guided us on pre arrival necessities and corona regulations. Satvik also organised a beautiful birthday celebration for my 7 yrs old daughter and a lovely spa on our arrival day. Ranjan the resort manager took over from 2nd day of our arrival until the 6th day of our checkout. Ranjan is highly professional, well spoken, extremely helpful and a true gem for this industry. He ensured we get currency conevrted in time - we got the best rates, car in time, he took care of our small needs. ensured packed breakfast was given on our road trips early morning.He made us feel at home. Lastly the chef mr abhijit steals the show. We dint had a single meal outside the postcard Galle. credit goes to the chef abhijit. His food was solace in a different country - perfectly spiced - great menu options - customised platter as requested was taken care by him. After each meal he ensured to check if the taste was fine. He has some talent as we must say. So the steal deal with srilanka's beauty is Galle the Postcard - Mr Ranjan and Mr Abhijit are the showstoppers. Must go without a second thought. Mr Kapil u have a great team. We shall definitely visit all your properties.","Amazing","2021-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8474349-d8472781-r823454707-The_Postcard_Galle-Gintota_Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Made the entire trip to galle wortrhwhile.
Well Located, Serene. Great Hardware. Very Colonial. Takes you back to a different Era.
Rooms are well appointed and amazing. Must do the Sea View Suite. Spacious, Separate Day Bed on a Balcony, large washroom with a Jaccuzi !
Many places to sit out and enjoy the weather. Be it the running Verandah's, balconies or the deck by the backwater.
This is a property where you actually kick up your feet and Relaaaaxxx !!

But what makes it great is the team.
Satvik the manager was absolutely amazing. Very Personal and ensures that you have just about everything you want. The entire team is so friendly. Ajith is just amazing, must mention Randika who just took care of our meals. Sithari who looks after Housekeeping must be mentioned, She was an Interntional level, award winning Boxer, Beat That ! The kitchen team is phenomenal and had us floored with different types of Dishes whether Local or International.

The Chauffer for the pick up was extremely helpful, Madu and very polite and informative.
The Spa services were just excellent

The hotel is a 200 year old heritage building that has been restored spectacularly with immense greenery and handpicked art pieces and artifacts across the property.

The hospitality was exceptionally warm. Satvik, the manager, and his team went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. Our every request and query was addressed within minutes. 

The food was some of the best we had on our trip in Sri Lanka. Meals were curated as per our preferences and the ingredients were locally sourced. The food was certainly cooked with a lot of heart and passion, we especially enjoyed the traditional Sri Lankan fare such as the Kottu Parotta and the Hoppers. The cocktails were also fabulous, Satvik and his team always had an ace up their sleeve when we wanted to try something new.

I would highly recommend The Postcard Galle to couples, families, and groups of friends traveling to Galle.

The view was superb and on our check-out day the wind was extreme so that if we put our hands out and we run, the wind makes such a noise I'm sure I can't even hear a dozen loudspeakers.

Local road so narrow ,winding and hard cornering for small bus.
This added to our wonderful experience.  
Small villages , flower and vegetable gardens, incredible scenery to view  if you were game to look out bus window! 
Stepping out on arrival, it's like you are transported back in time.
Magnificent scenery, incredible gardens , cool crisp air, and a wonderful welcome by staff.
My understanding is that the old tea factory has recently been renovated. 
This has been done by maintaining the old structures and even some of the equipment still in rooms.
I was delighted with a ground floor room in which I was able to open the windows and allow the fresh air in and gave me views of the misty valleys and beautiful gardens.
The room clean and comfortable.  Loved going to sleep on a comfortable bed with mosquito netting ..felt so regal.
No TV in room..ahhh bliss.
Rooms are not soundproofed, but honestly, I think this was part of maintaining the old tea factory charm.
This is a place for peace and quiet..
Walks , tea collecting, and production tours are available and are great.
The staff are incredibly friendly and professional .
The food and meals great variety. 
We had buffet style, which was possibly different to usual as we were a tour group.
I absolutely loved my stay here and am planning on returning so that my partner can experience this incredible location.

The buffet was incredible, with a wide variety of options including action stations, soups, salads, mains, hoppers, pancakes, waffles, and even an ice cream bar!

Our room was comfortable and conveniently located on the ground floor near the pool, just as we requested. They also provided a cozy cot for our baby, which was much appreciated. The pool was the perfect temperature, and the jacuzzi added a relaxing touch.

The hotel had daily activities for all ages > from kids’ painting and food carving to evening music and stage plays by the Animation Club. The staff involved were lovely and engaging.

I celebrated my birthday during our stay, and the team made it so special by singing for me and surprising me with a cake. It was such a heartfelt moment!

Your words capture so much of what Heritance Kandalama stands for, the architectural grandeur, harmony with nature, and thoughtful hospitality, all brought to life through the lens of your stay. Geoffrey Bawa’s vision has a way of casting its spell, and it’s clear it left its mark on you too. We're glad the panoramic view, the stillness of the lake, and even the gentle presence of the wildlife added to that sense of escape. Thank you for pointing out the subtle beauty of the hotel’s design and its on-point integration with the surroundings; it’s something we’re proud to preserve and share with our visitors. Sachini will be thrilled to hear your kind words. It’s lovely to know she helped make your husband’s birthday feel extra special.

This gigantic, magical architectural masterpiece, designed by the late Mr. Geoffrey Bawa, truly casts a spell on us. We find ourselves constantly dreaming of returning, especially when drowning in our busy schedules.

Perched next to the gorgeous Kandalama Lake, the structure seamlessly blends with nature, so much so that when viewed from the other side of the lake, it's virtually invisible, fully covered by lush vegetation. It's incredibly common to see wild animals roaming freely within the hotel grounds, reminding you that you're truly living in harmony within their natural habitat – so remember to be mindful and respectful of them.

Our 'Luxury Panoramic King' room, located on the 7th floor of the Dambulla wing (one of only three such rooms!), was incredibly spacious and offered a truly splendid view over the Kandalama Lake.

As always, the food was excellent and absolutely delicious, with a terrific spread for every meal. I made sure to pick up their homemade jam and marmalade as I always love to bring a taste of Heritance Kandalama home with me!

The staff were consistently amazing and super helpful. A special kudos goes to Sachini for being incredibly attentive and helping me arrange all the wonderful surprises for my husband’s birthday.

Lastly, don't forget to inquire about the various expeditions they have to offer, such as cultural tours to nearby historical sites or nature walks – they truly enhance the overall experience!","The enchanting spell of Heritance Kandalama","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r1016508777-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

Bed was super comfy and we enjoyed the views of the mountains and lake from all sides, sipping a coffee on the balcony watching birds, squirrels and monkeys in the morning. 
Food was absolutely fantastic, massive spread with great variety and very tasty at all 3 meals. Service was excellent, staff is attentive, courteous and very professional. Gym is very well equipped and the gym trainer is excellent. Pools were lovely, I specially enjoyed the infinity pool overlooking the lake at sunset - saw a majestic elephant drinking water at the lake one evening which was an added bonus. 
Best part of our holiday was the live entertainment. A wonderful traditional dance performance by very talented hotel staff, live band playing some great local tunes, and a lone flute player playing hauntingly beautiful melodies at sunset on the rocks overlooking the pools. The best entertainers were an amazingly talented, unforgettable oriental band and vocalist playing vintage Sinhala songs in the lobby bar one morning - same group that played in 2006 when we were last at this lovely hotel!

Heritance is a destination hotel it was the one time in a 19 day tour we wished we had more time in the resort. I won't go into all the details about the place it is well documented, one of the things we really enjoyed was the wild life Monkeys and Birds at our backdoor especially in the morning. All rooms look out and are private we were lucky to be looking out to a bush covered slope full of wildlife. Not really a bucket list moment but sitting in the bathroom doing your morning business with a monkey 20 feet away looking at you is probably a once in a life time experience.

If you do stay here allow time to enjoy the resort great views, great wildlife, lovely infinity pool right next to a great little cafe and bar.

The hotel itself is stunning, blending seamlessly with nature, views, elephants and rocks. Rooms were good size, comfy bed and lovely bathroom.

The staff were helpful and courteous throughout our stay. 

Unfortunately the breakfast buffet was not good, 2 mornings the chicken curry not cooked properly.  The al-la carte dinner was mixed in with the buffet people, worst situation, horrible atmosphere  and the meals the smallest we have seen.  My husband was very hungry after the meal.

We decided on the second night to eat at the open air cafe and this was such a blessing.  Ambience perfect, food delicious and the food was top-notch with plenty of variety and excellent taste. So much better than upstairs.

We did face an very important issue during our stay.  There are no usb ports or spare electrical outlets anywhere in the rooms. We had to unplug a bedside lamp only to find our convertor was too large as the outlets were right on the floor, so usb cables could not be plugged in.  Contacted staff and they immediately bought us a special box to plug our cables into, which was appreciated.  Next morning senior management confirmed not all rooms had been renovated and they were a number of these rooms with the same issue. So beware if you are in one of those rooms.

The views were amazing from the hotel, we got to see the pools but because we were on tour and not at hotel until late each night we were unable to utilize them.

This hotel was one of the better ones of our tour. Recommended.","A view o Sigiriya rock fortress.","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r1008045949-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

However, we did face some discomfort during our stay due to the air conditioning in our room. It was a particularly hot season, and the AC was fixed at 28°C, which made the room quite warm and uncomfortable. Although the staff made efforts to resolve the issue, they couldn’t do much as it’s part of a central AC system.

Additionally, we noticed that common areas such as the Kanchana Lounge didn’t seem to be air-conditioned either—possibly due to low occupancy during this period—but it did make the heat a bit more noticeable.

Despite the AC issues, the hotel delivered in terms of service, food, and ambiance.

Because of our past experience I returned this year with my friends and family in a large group of 16 persons of whom 6 are over 70 years of age.

The design by Geoffrey Bawa is sheer genius. The unobtrusive presence of the hotel on the landscape and its apparent merger with its surroundings, it’s beautifully ventilated corridors and strategically positioned rooms along with its magnificently framed views make each visit more rewarding and revelatory than the last.

The service, the rooms and the food were as outstanding as ever. We were a large group with different dietary requirements and preferences, and the hotel took care to cater to each one of us individually. Not only this, the pasty chef Mr Thalin Malinda and the dining room manager Mr Sarath organised cakes to celebrate the birthdays of members of our group. The hotel tour by the naturalist and in-house hotel historian Mr Nalinda should not be missed. 

However, there is one incident which now endears this hotel to us even more and shows its special character. While on elephant safari over an hour away from the hotel a member of our party who has an external heart pump suddenly realised that she had only 40 minutes of battery life left and had forgotten her spare battery in her hotel room and without which she could not survive.

While she rushed from the elephant reserve to the hotel, the hotel manager Mr Gamini took the battery from her room and drove in his personal vehicle to meet the patient half-way and they managed to replace the depleted battery in the very nick of time even after the beeping had already begun.
This was service over and beyond the call of duty or any expectation we could’ve had!

If I could bestow this hotel the *best hotel in the world award* I would.

From the very beginning - planning everything a year in advance from abroad - the team was kind, responsive, and extremely professional. They helped us organize room blocks for our guests, finalize the venues and menus, and thoughtfully plan details for the wedding day.

Most of our guests stayed at the hotel for the week leading up to the wedding day, and it was truly a serene, one-of-a-kind setting that allowed everyone to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of Sri Lanka. The staff showed an exceptional level of care and hospitality the entire week - we’ve never experienced anything like it.

On the day of the wedding, everything went perfectly. The timeline was smooth, the logistics were seamless, and we felt fully supported from start to finish. We were able to truly be present and enjoy every moment.

We couldn’t be more grateful to the team for the experience they gave us as a couple and for the beautiful memories they helped create for all our guests. Highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a meaningful, well-executed wedding experience.

We stayed here for one night, however within two minutes of checking in we wished we’d booked for longer.

It’s incredibly peaceful, somewhere to come and get away from it all. The food was incredible, and you can walk right into the kitchen and speak to the chef, even watch and learn how they prepare the food should you wish. Location wise it’s perched up in the hills above Kandy, a short drive down to the town - and perfect in that aspect as there’s much to do and see in Kandy. The hotel also offer a free Tuk Tuk service to take you down to town, you have to find you’re own way back up mind! This place made a huge impression on us. Highly recommended.

You feel right out in the peaceful countryside when staying there, even though Kandy itself is just a very short drive back down the hill behind.  It's in the perfect location, and so high up that the Brahminy kites and eagles are circling below you!
The property is accessed via an incredibly steep narrow but tarmac road, which our driver managed to traverse with baited breath!  The hotel also organised for a tuk tuk to pick us up one evening (offered to guests as a complementary service) so we could explore Kandy town and we found our own for the return journey, which cost about 1,000SLR (= £2.70).
We were allocated wonderful room 4 , which was huge, with double aspect windows with stunning views out over the valley and also with a long balcony down one side with seating, so it was lovely to sit out there with a drink at dusk.  Big bathroom too, with roll top style bath and powerful hot shower.  It was actually a family suite, with a separate twin room alongside which we didn't need for the 2 of us, so this was locked off from the main part of the suite when we were shown around.
Food was good - quite a short dinner menu but we opted for the Sri Lankan curry which was excellent - lots of little vegetable curry dishes alongside our choice of fish curry, and it was idyllic sitting looking over the valley whilst dining.    Breakfast options were a bit more limited at this hotel too, but still nice - either a curry with rotis or milk rice, or ""English"" which was eggs cooked as you wanted them plus toast and jam.
We'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a base in the Kandy area, and the infinity pool and loungers are the perfect place to cool off after exploring!","Idyllic peaceful boutique hotel - the perfect base to explore the Kandy area","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r996674143-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We stayed for two nights towards the end of February and we were sad to leave.  I would not hesitate to recommend or return to Flameback.

We chose Flameback as it was a smaller hotel, and felt more local than the big hotel complexes nearby.  We also wanted to experience the Safari/tent accommodation. 

The resort has three wild dogs there, who mainly slept under the trees in the shade, but came and greeted guests with a friendly face, wagging their tails.  They were very friendly and we really enjoyed having them there, one even snoozed on our porch one morning. 

Staff and Service 
The team at Flameback made our staff memorable.  With only a small team we felt like we were part of the Flameback Family and they could not have done anything more for us. 

Ahead of our trip, correspondents with the hotel receptionist was quick and easy, she arranged transportation to and from the hotel plus our itinerary for the 2.5 days we were there ; this included two half day safari’s and a cooking demonstration with lunch. 

Upon our arrival we received a warm welcome, with a cool towel and welcome drink.  After a short initial look around the reserve we were taken to out tent, our bags were already there when we arrived. 

The hotel staff were just fabulous, each team member did their job exceptionally well and make us feel like special guests.  No requests was too much and the chef even kindly made me their Sri Lankan Prawn dish for dinner one even, which was outside of the set dinner menu. 

Our waiters were extremely personable and we looked forward to seeing them for breakfast and dinner.  

Our safari guide and driver were fabulous, incredible knowledgeable and also very respectful to the animals, not crowding around like other jeeps did! 

I can honestly say, the service we received and how the team treat their guests is exceptional!  You can tell they have so much pride in their jobs. 

Food
We ate at the resort each evening; there was a set menu for $20 and it was delicious!  

Breakfast was included and we received fresh fruit, fruit juice, coffee, pastries and a cooked opinion (many choices on offer). All was cooked well and tasted very good.  The chef came to introduce himself and check all was well, which was a nice touch. 

The food was excellent!  The setting for dinner was also lovely, lots of candles and soft music.  The perfect way to unwind at the end a busy day. 

Accommodation and amenities 
We stayed in one of the deluxe tents, which we really enjoyed. It was the perfect size and decorated tasteful, in keeping with the surroundings. 

-Each tent had a working toilet, air-con and shower with both hot and cold water! 
-The bed was very comfortable with nice pillows and lovely soft linen. 
-Towels, robes, hairdryer and toiletries were provided 
-there was amble space to hang or fold your clothes. 
-the tent also came with a secure safety deposit box and a lock and key. 
-Drinking water was provided daily, a nice and welcomed touch. 
-WiFi is provided for free and considering the remoteness of the location, it was very reliable. 
-There were two plug points, perfect for charging your phone. 
-the pool was refreshing, clean and fitting in well with the surroundings. 

Flameback offer a range of additional services and trips, all good value and well organised. They really have something for everyone. 

Overall we had a wonderful stay at Flameback and wholeheartedly thank the team for being so wonderful.  Please support this excellent oasis, rather than the big hotels in the area. 

Points to consider 
Bring ear plugs!  
The first night I found the air-con loud, plus the noises of nature can be intense when trying to sleep.  I had a disturbed sleep and was woken up by monkeys running across our tent. 
Thankfully my husband carried some spare ear plugs, these worked brilliantly and I had a wonderful nights sleep on the second night. 

As you are close to the lake, bring mosquitoes spray.  We didn’t have any issues with bites, but came prepared and covered ourselves in repellent daily. 

As Flameback is on a nature reserve, expect to see lots of birds, a couple of lizards, monkeys and even maybe a small snake on the grounds.   We also had some ants in our lodge mainly in the shower up the wall, but this didn’t affect our stay at all. 

None of the above would stop us recommending Flameback, but worth mentioning.","An oasis of calm and tranquility.","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r940477337-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

Our African style safari tent (each named after birds - ours was Monarch) had everything we could wish for.  Amazing air con, great hot shower, comfy bed (though it was very hot even at night, so the duvet was a bit much and a sheet would have been better) and WiFi.  It also had its own deck and seating with views out over Weerawila lake which is a bird reserve, and there were always water birds on the lawn in front too.  
The two issues we had here were: 
a) Bug - mosquito type insects were literally swarming all the time immediately outside our tent, so we felt like we were taking our life in our hands entering and exiting each time, and could not enjoy the outside seating (although no issues first afternoon).   It was a similar situation at dinner, with them attracted to the lighting (albeit muted by staff to try to mitigate the situation).   The manager apologised and said it was just the time of year and had only just started to be an issue.  
b) Noise from outside the property.  The first night (Friday) there was booming music with a deep repeated base until 10pm  (we had gone to bed early due to a 5am start for Yala safari the next day!) and the second night (Saturday) this went on until 1am.  On the third afternoon when  we could hear it at 4pm we went out to the road to investigate and found a party bus with flashing lights and locals dancing around it just across the road from the Lodge.  Thankfully that night (Sunday) it went quiet by 7pm, I think the manager may have put a call in after guest complaints.  He advised that unfortunately, local regulations only restricted noise after 1am at weekends and after 10pm on other nights!  He agreed this was not good for a bird reserve and advised he was in a local association with other hoteliers pushing for further constraints, which suggests this is an ongoing issue.  We would therefore not recommend staying on a weekend, or take good ear plugs!  In general, the lodge is not as isolated as it appears, with a busy road nearby which passes across the lake.
Food was nice, and they had the largest international menu of all the properties we stayed at, with some really good dishes, but it was not the best - perhaps trying to offer too much choice. It was Valentines Day when we arrived and they laid on a special set menu which was a nice touch.
The lodge had a good pool near the lake but only 3 pairs of sun loungers, which was sometimes not quite enough for the 7 tents, when guests returned from their morning safaris.
The Lodge's naturalist took us on a walk in the grounds and he was very good at identifying birds for us.  Each guest receives a free 10min foot massage which was a lovely bonus, and we also paid for full body aromatherapy massages which were very good - although the monkeys running over the spa's roof were a bit distracting:-)   We loved watching the torque macaques and grey langurs playing in the grounds though - just make sure you keep your tents locked and don't leave food in them!
Communication was a bit confused on occasion - when we checked in we were advised a complementary local Arrack cocktail was available before dinner and we thought this was each night (as had been the case in our previous hotel) but it transpired this was just the first night and we had to pay after that.  We were also not advised that there was a campfire each night down by the lake, where you could have your pre dinner drinks sitting on bean bags - which we discovered and enjoyed on our last evening.
If you're on an extended trip, you can get your laundry done here which is handy - this service is outsourced to the Hilton hotel next door and returned next day, which was useful for us towards the end of our travels, and with clothes getting so dusty on safari.
We've also put a video of our experience of this Lodge on our NoBananas Youtube channel.  Overall a nice stay - we really enjoyed our days and the scenery, but some frustrations in the evenings and at night which stopped us being able to relax and sleep.  Some of these issues were obviously outside of the management's control, but you should be aware.","Peaceful Days, Poor Nights","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r997949410-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

Flameback Eco Lodge was the perfect base. Our ""tents"" or lodges were more glamping than camping  -  they each had air-conditioning, showers with constant hot water, and a loo. They were extremely comfortable, especially the beds, and had many thoughtful touches such as rechargeable torches, and universal sockets.  Each lodge was raised up on its own deck, and slightly angled and  positioned far enough away from the others for privacy and all were really close to the lakeside so we could sit out on our front decks and watch the birdlife in utter peace. 
The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Special mention for the nature guide who took us on an hour's walk around the grounds and nearby to help identify the bird species and the plants. He was extremely knowledgeable and interesting. 
We also enjoyed massages at the simple spa up among the treetops, and the excellent small restaurant also up at tree level, which was open-air but under cover. Breakfasts up there were a lovely way to start the day (or to enjoy on return from a very early-morning safari). 
The lodge has found a great balance between being ecologically aware and thoughtful about the environment, and comfort and relaxation. It's only about a 15-minute drive to Bundala national park (highly recommended, especially for bird-watchers) and about 40 minutes from Yala national park.","Superb private lodges in a lakeside setting","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r997923390-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

The rooms were clean, spacious and cosy.
The food was extremely good and you will never get disappointed the way they treat you. Hats off for the incredible staff for being nice, pleasant, supportive and always with a smile. 

A special thank for the incredible chefs Mr. Sanka and Diamond for preparing lovey meals and the servers Farath, Nethmi and  Tharindu for treating us well and making us special not as their guests but as their own family members. Also I would like to thank Ishara and Sagar (front office) and Lakmal (food and beverage manager) for their hospitality.
Wish I can change 2 nights to 3 nights because you will not get this experience everywhere! Hope to visit again soon :) Cheers!!

The atmosphere, enhanced by live music and colonial charm, made our stay especially memorable.

The service throughout the hotel was warm and friendly, including from General Manager Suresh Abbas, who was often visible and engaging with guests.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. Although we had booked three rooms, the front office declined our request for a late checkout on just one room unless we paid half the room rate, which felt a bit inflexible. Some parts of the hotel are showing signs of age—for example, the carpet along the corridor is quite worn and would be better removed if it can’t be replaced.

We also had a safety concern with the shower setup over the bathtub, as there was no anti-slip mat provided. Fortunately, the hotel responded promptly and moved us to another room the next day upon request.","Hotel with a colonial charm","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r1015644121-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

During that time, I’ve stayed in private villas, hostels and family homes. For my final two nights in the capital city, I wanted some luxury with a colonial touch. An iconic landmark that would hold a lasting memory. 

For over 160 years, Galle Face Hotel has blended colonial charm with modern elegance, earning its place as the Grande Dame of South Asia and the most iconic destination in Colombo. Celebrates such as Steven Spielberg, Che Guevara, Earnest Hemingway, Sting, Sade, Robbie Williams, Lord Mountbatten and Richard Nixon have stayed here. 

The buffet is fantastic and I’m not a fan of these at all. Service is impeccable and staff go above and beyond to ensure you have a memorable stay whilst here. They’re proud to work here. The pool is unfortunately salt water and not chlorinated. The views are spectacular and for once I never left the hotel. This very unusual for me. 

The passionfruit frozen daiquiri is to die for as is the cheesecake. The mutton Rogan Josh was delicious, the sweet selection, gin & tonics and of course the Lion draught beer. This was impulsively booked right at the last minute. My room was fit for a prince, overlooking the Indian Ocean and Galle Face Green. Spectacular and what an outstanding front of house team.

We really enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable.
Our room was large, clean and nicely furnished. 
The hotel pool is not very big and only has a few loungers, but the view from there is nice.
The hotel has a restaurant and an extra rooftop bar. For breakfast there was a buffet with various things (fruit, toast, curry, waffles, egg,...). For dinner we had a buffet once and a 4-course menu on the other evening. The food was always very tasty and the service very good.
Unfortunately, what annoyed us was the constantly repeating melody in the hotel and the construction of the neighboring building.
Kandy Lake was about a 10 minute walk away and the town about 30 minutes. However, there were also tuktuks.","Hotel with a nice view","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r1016347462-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The view, the food and the excellent service... and the rooftop bar.
And the infinity pool.
OK so this hotel has a lot going for it.

We'd booked in advance and paid a little extra for a (what we interpreted as) better room. We were a little disappointed to discover our family room was on the sub-level. Once we spoke to the reception they understood and installed us into a top floor room with amazing views over Kandy.
The food is great here. Chef will come out and say hello during dinner service. Breakfast is also excellent and swift.
Make sure you get a chance to enjoy the pool. Being on the edge of the world and looking into the busy green city is not to be missed. The pool is small and cute and only a few loungers so you need to be friendly with your fellow guests.
Also make sure to enjoy the evening sunset views from the rooftop bar. The music is good, the barmen are good, the vibe is good. It's just a good time!

Highly recommend this hotel for families and saw many couples enjoying it too.

Make sure you tip the bellboy. He's a good dude.

The rooms have international plugs, AC, minibar, hairdryers etc... the bathrooms have toiletries and everything you need.
Definitely get a tuktuk or taxi as its up a big hill. ","Luxury with an amazing view","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r965103135-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

It was good location to Kandy we happily walked down to Kandy and caught a Tuk Tuk back. We were on a dinner bed and breakfast rate, where the food was good the brownie we had one night was particularly tasty. 
The staff were attentive and the hotel was generally well kept and very pleasant. The smell in our room was very odd though, like a powerful cleaning smell. I’ve never had a problem with room smells before so found this odd! So much so that whilst in the room we had the patio door open and didn’t have any room service the following day to avoid it heightening any more.

Theva provided me a brilliant haven during my first Sri Lankan adventure, they made an everlasting impression on how I looked at Sri Lanka.  
Everything was superb, from the management to the team of male staff, they were cheerful, friendly, respectful and they all worked in unisent.  
Upon arrival we were welcomed with a glass of refreshing amarella fruit drink (salty but sweet at the same time).  I used to eat this fruit in Chinatown in Houston, New York or while traveling in Southeast Asia but never as a juice, from that day on I had one made for me everyday.  
We were given a room next to the pool, it was filled with sunlight and very spacious with a big balcony but there was a minor leak from the ceiling down the wall to the floor, we informed the management and they moved us to another room which has a jacuzzi by the glass window.  It was an upgrade as the manager put it though it’s a tiny bit smaller with no balcony but it was a very beautiful room, the spacious shower is better designed aesthetically also more practical; the floor didn’t get wet when I shower like the room before the upgrade.  THANK YOU!!!
Very comfortable, AC worked perfectly and not noisy, plenty of hot water for the shower and the jacuzzi.  They also a hot sauna which I used one time (ask them to turn it on one hour before) it was at 60 according to the thermostat, hot enough to relax  and sweat some.  They even had an hourglass of 15m in the sauna, I’m a sauna girl and that was a very thoughtful detail.  
Theva Cuisine is the name of the restaurant they have on site where we had breakfast, dinner and lunch sometimes, loved their breakfast with fresh homemade bread and pastries.  Their dishes are versatile made to please all guests from different cultures/countries.  There was a lot of umps in every bite, an explosion of emotion in each morceau.  
They even went out of their way to prepare dishes my way or fruit drinks that I would make for myself at home.   Once they learnt that we like our food authentic and spicy the game was on.  
Words cannot describe how we enjoyed our stay at Theva with amazingly spectacular views from either sitting at their infinity pool or sitting by the windowsill in the room.  
The management and the staff run a tight ship show, well trained, well disciplined.  
Ms. Dheeshana, the owner/management director, was on site when we were staying at the residency, we share the same opinion that she should open a business in training hotel staff, we were so impressed with her staff.  Me, personally, I felt as if I was in a grand hotel like Hôtel Negresco in Nice on the Promenade des Anglais.   
By the way, loved her herb garden, I even had fresh spinach soup, it was out of this word.","A True Gem in Kandy Sri Lanka 10 out of 5 stars service","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r1013170440-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

We had a room which ended up having a small leak in the wall and they gave us an upgrade to a better room with a jacuzzi which was very nice but honestly the other room was nice as well. 
As it’s ultra low season there was never many people in the hotel so the staff couldn’t be more helpful 
Things  to be aware of It’s quite a way up the hill from town you can walk down in 40 mins if you don’t get lost  but it would be quite a slog up . I got a tuk tuk up for 700 Rupees which is just over 2 dollars. 

Ok what about the food ? …,overall excellent. Wonderful breakfasts dreamy dinner love the possibly  too small  portions of meatballs with so many flavour profiles and the black pork curry was fantastic maybe could have been a bit more spicy but I guess they are catering for a very international audience.  If anything wasn’t quite as you wanted it you they did this best to change it. 

They could have mean more generous with the free water in the room rather than 2 tiny bottles ( but when asked they always provided them free of charge . The mats for the sun beds need to be replaced as they slip off all the time as all the straps are broken These though are very very minor points

So would I stay here again definitely and for what I paid due to the season excellent value. Food is a real positive. Definitely high end Asian fusion 

The range of juices all freshly made are all excellent. 

Great hotel glad we decided to stay there and will certainly come back next time I’m in Kandy. The Staff make it. 

One final point up so high on the hill the air is much much  cleaner , there is a lovely breeze and it’s much calmer than down in the town. For an extended stay this for me is the only location I would stay in","Top Class Boutique Hotel","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r1011906366-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

The food was excellent, with a good choice of both Sri Lanka and International meals, and the staff, particularly as they got to know us during the stay, were friendly, professional and efficient. They made an extra effort on the evening of my wife's birthday, with flowers and chocolates in the room.

It is quite out of the way, up a narrow twisty road, which might be an issue for some people, although it is on the right side of town for the railway station which is a benefit.

The room was very spacious and comfortable, but some of the furniture seemed a bit dated and due for refreshment. Apart from that we had no complaints at all.

Theva's in-house restaurant makes everything from scratch, even the pastries, and the menu has some unique items that are not always easy to find elsewhere on the island. The staff is kind, hospitable, and helpful as well. I definitely recommend stopping off at Theva during your travels to Kandy.","Lovely 1-night stay","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r998287940-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

There are two large pools, and the view from the main pool is simply amazing.

We tried both the dinner and lunch buffets, which offered a nice spread of local and international dishes. However, the lighting in the restaurant could be improved — it feels a bit dark and uninviting.

It was quiet and relaxing with a boutique hotel feel - only 5 yurts sharing the facilities  of Skylark restaurant and swimming pool.

A welcome cocktail by the firepit with fire flies dancing around the trees was enchanting the first evening. 

An ideal place to stay if on Safari at Udawalawe and Yale National Parks.

If you enjoy camping, you will probably be fine!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This has been a difficult review to write. We have given it 4 stars but maybe 3 and a half would be fairer, if that were possible. My instinct would be to give it 3 stars, but the other 3 star reviews of this place are far more critical than our experience would justify.

There is much to like about this place. The views of the lake shore and birdlife just feet from your deck are beautiful (if you frame your photo correctly) and the team are charming and helpful as individuals (but confused and disorganised as a collective). The safaris, which are a key feature of the lodge, are beautiful, but involve a long drive there and back, and they do not appear to have worked out how to coordinate meals with the safari schedule. 

Some other reviews have been critical of the 'glamping' tents, but they were one of the positives for us. The bed was very comfortable and the air con was efficient (but obviously noisy) and the showers were efficient with plenty of hot water. The deck was a pleasant place to sit at times but the flying things became a nuisance as dusk settled. This is understandable given the location, and not a complaint. 

Another positive has been the quality of the meals we had (I will talk later about the meals we did not have). We had a Sri Lankan meal on our first night, and a 'European' meal the second. Both were really enjoyable and served with good humour. Breakfast was tasty and filling. 

The pool area is welcoming and very enjoyable. 

As for the negatives, the proximity to the main road cannot be ignored. The traffic noise is a constant and occasionally even drowned out the air con. The site is also shared with a large hotel. This did not impact on us but the publicity for Flameback Eco Lodge does imply a more secluded location. The birdwatching walk with the naturalist consisted largely of the Hilton hotel car park. To be fair, it was quite a rich environment for birds, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. 

The restaurant and lounge area are a bit tired. The cushions on the sofas are quite dirty, the glass table tops need a clean and everything needs a little attention. 

We were not impressed by the service overall which was a bit disorganised. We assumed that our room would have been straightened by the time that we got back from an early safari, but it was untouched until I asked for it to be done and even then, empty drinks glasses were left uncollected for the duration of our stay. They close the window blinds at night as part of the turn-down service but they do not open them again. This might sound trivial but rolling up the blinds involves balancing on the edge of the deck, finding something to stand on to raise the zip to the top, getting soaked by rainwater/condensation run off, and disturbing a swarm of flying things. Getting water replenished required several requests. Not exactly 5 star!

We went on an (excellent) safari getting up at 04:15 for a 04:45 departure. A snack of 2 small bananas, cake and water is provided. When you get back about 10:30, we had breakfast which was welcome. About 12:30, we asked about a light snack before the 13:45 afternoon safari but only full lunch meals were available which we did not want, having only finished our breakfast 90 minutes earlier. No snacks were available  (crisps nuts or fruit and crackers would have been fine). By the time we got back from the afternoon safari at 18:45, we were ravenous. This needs thinking through. 

Overall, the publicity for this place implies an atmosphere of seclusion, exclusivity and luxury that is not borne out by the reality.","A mixed picture🤔","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d13564923-r994412622-Flameback_Eco_Lodge-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",

Firstly, all of the staff are AMAZING and so so so attentive. They went above and beyond to make sure I made the most out of my stay. 

The deluxe tents are great. The beds were super comfy, facilities were all in great working order and the view over the lake was incredible. 

I used there in house service to do 2 safari mornings, both of which were fantastic. My guide was so knowledgable and I got to see a variety of animals and my favorite animal, elephants! They packed a beautiful breakfast of fruits and cakes for me. 

In the afternoons the manager took me on 2 village based tours to see different varieties of birds, which were all beautiful! He knew every type of species and we must of seen over 30 different types! 

The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka and the candlelit dinner was also very tasty. 

The pool is perfect to relax in the afternoon sun after a morning safari. 

Also as a solo female traveller, I felt completely safe at all times! 

If you're looking to be out in nature, nestled with the birds but still have a luxury feel and service then this is the place for you. I could not recommend it highly enough and will definitely be visiting again in the future!","Highlight of my trip!

The rooms are spacious with high ceilings, they are clean with nice outdoor areas around them, and the family rooms were next to each other with a balcony where the young people hung out and played cards.

The bathrooms are spacious with a nice rainforest shower.

It's very green and cool, there are several areas where you can chill and relax, it offers a great pool, a little library where you can read a book or borrow cards or a board game and a water fountain to refill bottles.

I must mention the food here.  It was gourmet first class and possibly the best food we had in all of Sri Lanka (and we had some great food).  The chef is exceptional and whilst there isn't a large choice on the menu, this is a good sign as it means the chef cooks everything fresh for you.  

If you let them know in advance then at no cost you can accompany the chef and watch him as he prepares the evening curry meal.  Knowing now how good this chef is, we wish we had done this.  Next time maybe.

There is an infinity pool with stunning views over the river valley and lovely to refresh in after a hot busy day.

Our room (number 4) was well appointed, comfortable and with fantastic river views including a balcony with separate dining capacity which we used for breakfast both mornings. The bathroom was massive and included a large walk in shower (pressure a bit low though) and free standing bath tub.

We ate the Sri Lankan curries on both nights and enjoyed them a lot. Apparently the spices are toned down for Western taste buds! Disappointing that they had no red wine at all on the first night although they had corrected this by the following evening.
The pool is small but welcome in the hot weather and frequently visited by a troop of mischievous monkeys who turn on the poolside taps for a drink!

The pool is lovely and wasn't crowded, and we had a magnificent view of the Indian Ocean. Firebeach bar offers a variety of drinks and food. 
The beds are comfy, and the rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel's interior is breathtaking.

The location is great, really peaceful, with lovely views of the hills, which makes for a relaxing atmosphere. The staff is friendly and welcoming, but sometimes a bit slow to respond to requests, which can be a little frustrating when you need something quickly.

The room I stayed in was decent, but could use a little updating. It felt a bit dated, and the bathroom had some minor issues, like low water pressure and inconsistent hot water. However, the bed was comfy, and the air conditioning worked well, which is always a plus.

The food was good, though not mind-blowing. It’s solid enough, but I’d suggest stepping up the variety a bit.

La vue des chambres et du restaurant est panoramique et magnifique sur tout les alentours du lac et sur le temple de la dent….
La piscine, même petite, est un joyau triangulaire à débordement, l effet de la vue quand on se baigne est spectaculaire et saisissant.
Les chambres sont spacieuses, modernes et bien agencées, avec grand balcon et immense baie vitrée coulissante, elles sont toutes avec vue. Literie parfaite, transat et fauteuils confortables sur le balcon, clim silencieuse, douche spectaculaire (à découvrir) , luminaires, décoration , rien n est laissé au hasard !
Seul manque un meuble pour poser la valise…
Il y a l’espace, mais pas le meuble.
La réception a l air libre ou presque est bien intégrée, le personnel partout souriant et accueillant.
Le restaurant est dans la même lignée, le buffet du petit déjeuner et du dîner est parfait , les cuisiniers et les chefs toujours aux aguets pour vous mitonner un plat supplémentaire avec le sourire. Seule la musique d ambiance mériterait une plus grande diversité et surtout plus actuelle !
Je ne regrette vraiment pas mon choix et je conseille à tous de séjourner ici, loin du tumulte et de la pollution du centre-ville accessible en tuk tuk (10minutes / 500 Rp, soit 1,50€).","Séjour parfait dans un hôtel splendide !","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r996543940-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

This quaint & authentic hotel is perfectly situated in a slightly quieter part of beautiful Galle, still within easy walking distance from all of the sights & sounds. Rooms were immaculately clean with large modern bathrooms. We were extremely well looked after by the hotel staff, particularly so by Sithija & Akanasha who couldn't do enough to help. They were a great credit to this lovely hotel. 

Sithija set our outside table up for breakfast every morning so that we could all sit together. Breakfast was fantastic, huge choices cooked to perfection - with a Sri Lankan breakfast option also on offer. As we were staying for 5 nights we were all treated to a complimentary 3 course dinner, it was superb and once again served on our favourite outside table. 

We absolutely loved Galle and this hotel played a key part in our enjoyment, wonderful staff, great food and a perfect location.

We stayed in both the Sigiriya Wing and Dambulla Wing, and each side had its own magic! If you’re a nature or wildlife lover, you will absolutely love the Sigiriya Wing. It’s surrounded by beautiful forest and feels like you’re part of nature itself. The Dambulla Wing, on the other hand, gave us breathtaking views of Kandalama Lake — a view we’ll never forget!

The food was absolutely delicious with a wide variety to choose from — every meal was a treat.

My stay at Heritance Kandalama was nothing short of extraordinary! Designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, this eco-luxury hotel blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, offering a breathtaking experience in the heart of Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle.

Location & Ambience
Perched on the edge of the Kandalama Lake, this stunning hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, rocky cliffs, and abundant wildlife. The architecture is a masterpiece—built into the mountainside, making it feel like an extension of nature itself. The views of Sigiriya Rock Fortress in the distance add to the magic of this place.

Rooms & Comfort
The rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and offer spectacular lake or jungle views. The floor-to-ceiling windows bring nature right into the room. I woke up to the sound of birds and the sight of monkeys playing in the trees outside my balcony. The luxurious bathroom with a rain shower and a deep bathtub made my stay even more relaxing.

Dining Experience
The buffet at Kanchana Restaurant was one of the best I’ve experienced, offering a mix of Sri Lankan and international cuisine. The quality of the food, fresh ingredients, and live cooking stations made every meal special. The rooftop dining experience with panoramic views of the lake was truly unforgettable.

Facilities & Activities
Infinity Pools – The iconic infinity pool overlooking the jungle and lake is breathtaking, perfect for a relaxing swim.

Ayurvedic Spa – A must-try! The treatments were rejuvenating, set in a serene environment.

Nature Walks & Bird Watching – The hotel is home to many bird species, making it ideal for nature lovers.

Cycling & Excursions – The hotel organizes tours to Sigiriya, Dambulla Cave Temple, and Minneriya National Park for wildlife safaris.

Service & Hospitality
The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. Every request was met with a smile, and their hospitality made me feel truly welcome.

Best Time to Visit
The hotel is beautiful year-round, but the dry season (May to September) is ideal for sightseeing and wildlife experiences.

Overall Verdict
⭐ 5/5 – Heritance Kandalama is not just a hotel; it’s an experience. Whether you’re looking for luxury, nature, or culture, this hotel offers it all. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sri Lanka!","Highly recommend","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r1000807101-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

What an amazing place! The bedroom was roomy, cleaned daily  and the bed was very comfortable. The food was great with lots of different dishes  to choose from every day- I'm vegetarian and there was lots for me to choose from. There was masses for meat eaters too. 
All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly- nothing was too much trouble. Special thanks to Asanka and Modasanka who made sure our room was comfortable and clean- all the staff were gracious though, we just didnt catch their names!
 We tried all 3 swimming pools and found them all fab but would have appreciated some shaded areas around the poolside, but that is a small quibble as the ambience around all the pools was calm and peaceful-the views were good too. 
We really enjoyed seeing the monkeys ( macaques and langurs) from the balcony (and made sure to keep our balcony door locked when we were out as the macaques were very clever and determined little critters!).
We went on the jungle walk with Narinder, the resident naturalist and on another day took a tuk tuk to the Cave temples at Dambulla which are so beautiful. We also went to Pophams arboretum (near Dambulla) and thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. Just taking walks around the hotel and to the eco area  was enjoyable too.
We appreciated all the wildlife ( eg lizards, birds, butterflies) around the site and for us that was the 'icing on the cake' and ensured our stay gave us memories to last a lifetime.","Amazing hotel, fantastic food and gracious staff.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r1000668458-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

The winding roads leading to the hotel are a bit eyebrow raising, and even when you pull up to the driveway, it's still very unassuming. But we were immediately welcomed into what would become a highlight in our Sri Lanka trip.

Theva Residency is a nicely adorned boutique property in the hills of Kandy. An easy 15-20 minute drive to Temple of the Tooth and Kandy city center proper. The service was warm, friendly, and genuine from the moment we checked in. We were assigned room 7, and it was a beautiful mountain facing room, that was exceptionally large. The bed was super comfortable, and the hotel had all of the major amenities you could need in the bathroom. 

What really sets Theva apart is their ability to be boutique, but have all of the bells and whistles of a luxury hotel. While we didn't use the pool, little touches like turn down service and someone bringing chocolates before bedtime were nice touches. The food was INCREDIBLE - we had the set menu for dinner and the options were fantastic, presentation was impeccable, and service was stellar. It also helps that this property has more staff than guests so they're always looking to enhance the experience. 

I was especially blown away by breakfast - a multi-course affair with a fresh fruit plate and bread basket to start. All of which were fresh and super tasty. Coffee your way - I asked for a regular drip (filtered) coffee and it was served in a French press!

Theva is in a league of its own, and for someone who regularly stays at 5* luxury resorts, I was so incredibly surprised by how lovely this stay was. Would highlight recommend to anyone visiting Kandy and looking for a boutique / local stay with genuine care and service.","A Gem In The Hills of Kandy","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12216800-d1475982-r971397723-Theva_Residency-Hantana_Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Während dieser Zeit gerieten wir in einen mehrwöchigen Pandemie-Lockdown und waren irgendwann die einzigen Gäste. Wir hatten ein sehr schlechtes Gewissen, allen so viel Mühe zu bereiten. Dennoch haben sich die Mitarbeiter einfach rührend um uns gekümmert! Sie waren unglaublich freundlich und der Service blieb auch in dieser Zeit einwandfrei. Das Team hat uns immer wieder mit neuem, ausnehmend gutem Essen überrascht (nachdem wir die sehr leckere Speisekarte mehrfach durchprobiert hatten) und hat wirklich alles getan, um uns den Lockdown so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Der Einsatz des ganzen Teams und auch ihrer Chefin war wirklich außergewöhnlich! Vor allem unserer kleinen Tochter wurde wirklich jeder Wunsch von den Lippen abgelesen. Obwohl die Lebensmittel zu dieser Zeit im Land immer teurer wurden, schaffte es das Team immer wieder, ihr die geliebte Teva-Schokoladentorte zu backen. Als wir dann endlich abreisten, bekam unser Kind Spielzeug geschenkt und eine Torte als „Wegzehrung“ überreicht.

The food here was great. It was authentic, aromatic, delicious. The taste of the food was just amazing. 

The hotel was on top of the mountain so the view from the hotel was just mind blowing. The ambience of the hotel was excellent. 

The staff was so well mannered.

Recommended food: Thai green curry with rice, Soup of the day served in the bread bowl, baked white onion with cheese toast soup, Theva special rice and curry served with 17 authentic srilankan curries, Theva wattalapan pot, Home made Icecream, Battered fried fish with salad. 

Most highlights of the visits are Soup of the day served in the bread bowl, Theva special rice and curry served with 17 authentic srilankan curries.

Highly recommend this place to visit.

The bathtub could also do with some refurbishment it is falling part.

Thank you for sharing such a heartfelt and insightful review of your experience at Heritance Ahungalla.

We are so pleased to hear that you admired the unique architecture by Geoffrey Bawa, and that the open, colonial-style design resonated with you. It’s wonderful that Dulshan could share his knowledge of Bawa’s legacy, as his work is truly an integral part of the Sri Lankan architectural heritage.

We are also grateful for your kind words about our staff. It’s always our goal to make our guests feel at home, and we are glad to hear we succeeded in doing so.

The hotel interior, the view, the location, everything was impeccable. The rooms have a great view and offer a lot of different activities and games for all age groups.
But most of all we have to commend the services provided by all the staff members. We have to especially thank the kitchen team, the chef and especially Mr. Chamuditha. We are a Jain family of 11, hailing from India, with a lot of food restrictions that are generally unheard of in Sri Linka. We were able to personally coordinate all our meals with the chefs and the trainee chefs with Mr. Chamuditha as our mediator. We had a total of 6 meals at the hotel and not a single one was disappointing. They have accomodated our every need with a smiling face. Coming to Sri Lanka we were already worried about the availability of Vegetarian food let alone Jain, but we can now go back and say with surety that no such issue can occur at The Heritance.

That was one of it's selling points to me. I wanted a relaxing holiday and that's what I got staying here. I was very pleased with my room on the third floor, over looking the 'quiet pool' with the India Ocean in the back ground, it was a view to die for. My housekeeper Lasan kept my room very clean and tidy and entertained me each day with his towel origami and restock of bottled water.  I did have a minor issue at the beginning of my holiday in the Jutes restaurant with the waiting staff, as they are not assertive or aware enough when you sit at your table of asking you if you want water or drinks, I had to keep asking and I wasn't the only one (maybe more training needed?) but this was quickly sorted by Supervisor Chamuditha, whom I was very impressed with, by his professional manner of rectifying this issue and on my every visit to Jutes for the rest of my holiday I was well looked after by him or in his absence his colleague Supervisor Waruna. The buffet style layout is large over two areas with a lot of verity, which I found good and plentiful. I was on the All Inclusive package, which suited me, but  'Western Branded' alcohol is chargeable.  The evening entertainment was ok, but could be improved upon and there was no native entertainment. All, in all I have to say I really liked the relaxing vibe of this hotel and the staff's way of a slower pace of life, which you do have to get used to, but I do think they could take their customer service up a level, and it's not 'Western world' standard 5*, but it's very clean, comfortable and very unique in it's architecture and the staff were professional, polite, helpful and friendly.  For me personally, as a female solo traveller I felt very safe at all times.  Would I return? yes I would.","Just what I needed.","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r1001312240-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We got the Staffs' undivided attention. The Staff are incredibly professional, friendly and can not do enough to help you. The Chefs were outstanding - the menu caters for Western tastes, however if you ask him to cook locally he can let his colours shine and produce some exceptionally tasty curries and condiments if you can handle the spice.

The setting of Flameback Eco Lodge is on the lake shore and boasts a stunning array of wildlife in and around the the lodges (mongooses, water birds, monkeys, eagles. If you want to go further a field the hotel can arrange for dawn/dusk/all day Safaris to seek wildlife in the National Parks (leopard, elephants, buffalo, jungle fowl.....) The pictures displayed really are exactly what you can expect to get. As expected accommodation is modern, clean, tidy and full of personal touches. You will be spoil for choices of where you can dine (in your tent/private floating pod/communal terrace). The tents are very spacious excellently air conditioned, and feature immaculate fully plumbed bathrooms. 

We can't give enough praise and thanks to the team for making an especially memorable stay at Flameback Eco Lodge. I recommend bringing a decent camera and pair of binoculars with you!

The owner took a great deal of trouble to show us round on arrival and there was plenty to enjoy, from the library on the first floor with its large open windows to the gardens and pool.  We also took a yoga class in the studio under the pool, which was spectacular as there was a rainstorm throughout and we were safely tucked away watching it come down outside.

It is a beautiful colonial.house. We were in room 3 in the main house 
The main house rooms have the best views over the river 
Our room did not have a television but was large. There was not much storage to unpack our clothes   Tea and fresh coffee facilities. Desk and wifi. Lovely large bathroom with bath and shower. We didn’t use the bath as we found the hot water in the shower ran out fairly quickly and didn’t want to risk running a bath 
The pool was the highlight and in fact why we booked this hotel. It was new having been built within the last year. Fairly chilly but refreshing. And those views !!! We felt this hotel’s pricing was a little on the high side for the facilities but having the pool area, for us, made up for that.  
Not a huge choice of Sri Lankan food choices for dinner if you are staying here for a while but plenty to please if you are only staying a few days.

Wir können den Besuch absolut weiterempfehlen. 

Besonders positiv aufgefallen ist uns:

- Der Blick von der Villa in das Flusstal des Mahaweli Ganga hinter Kandy ist grandios und lädt zum Verweilen und Entspannen auf den angrenzenden Terrassen oder im Pool ein.
- Die Zimmer im Haupthaus waren mit Tresor, Klimaanlage und Moskitonetz super ausgestattet und stilvoll eingerichtet. 
- Volker Bethke, der freundliche Gastgeber mit deutsch-hanseatischen Wurzeln, hat uns mit Tipps und Tricks bzgl. Kandy und lokalen Gepflogenheiten (z.B. Tuk-Tuk Preisen) versorgt.
- Die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter, die aber durchaus auch verstanden, wenn man gerade mal nicht ausschweifende Gespräche sucht. Letzteres war in Sri Lanka manchmal schwierig zu finden. 
- Wir haben den Koch der Villa Rosa bei seinem Markteinkauf begleitet und viel über regionales Gemüse und Obst gelernt, das dann für den Abend frisch zubereitet wurde. Schöner kann man den lokalen Markt in Kandy nicht erleben. Man sollte sich nur nicht von den Verkäufern zu Einkäufen drängen lassen; nur weil der einheimische Koch dabei ist, bekommt man nicht unbedingt faire Preise.","Herzliche Gastfreundschaft mit tollem Ausblick","2023-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r914737587-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Alles hier atmet Heiterkeit und Schönheit, ich kann es nicht weniger poetisch ausdrücken.
Der Blick über den Fluss ist spektakulär und der Sonnenuntergang schlicht atemberaubend. 
Jedes Detail in der Villa Rosa ist mit Bedacht und Schönheitssinn ausgewählt, von den Möbel aus antikem Holz über den wundeschönen Pool (kühl, bietet tatsächlich Erfrischung) bis hin zu stets frischgewaschenen Baumwollsets beim Essen. 

Das landestypische oder westliche Frühstück und Essen ist hervorragend und wird an Tischen serviert, von denen jeder den fantastischen Blick bietet, abends sehr stimmungsvoll bei Kerzenlicht.

Der Hausherr kümmert sich charmant und mit hanseatischer Zurückhaltung um seine Gäste.

Wir hatten eine große Familiensuite mit riesigem Bad.

Bei der Buchung darauf achten, dass die Zimmer in der (günstigeren) Dependance den Blick in die andere Richtung haben!

Wir fanden das Boutiquehotel insgesamt noch schöner als auf den Fotos, ein Genuß für Ästheten!

He picks the ingredients from the large vegetable garden on site and prepares simply divine food! He prepared vegan Western food for the children and for us an excellent vegan Sri Lankan meal! You can connect there with nature, and the Sri Lankan story. The pool with the beautiful view was my children's favorite place in the hotel. This is a boutique hotel with personal attention. A wonderful experience! In addition, the hotel is clean and polished and gives a homey feeling. The peace that the hotel offers cannot be found anywhere else.

A beautiful house with friendly staff, and a quietly luxurious, wooden floored  connecting family room. The views from our balcony were insane.

Swimming pool is fresh and probably has one of the best views of any pool in the world. And the food - lunch was good from the a la carte menu but the thali dinner was simply sublime and one of the best of the holiday. Fish curry in particular delicious. Breakfast by contrast probably the weakest of the places we stayed but still absolutely fine.

Volker was incredibly friendly and always checked in on us to find out our plans or to chat. Really nice, cheerful man. He has a stunning place that he is rightly proud of.

Kids absolutely loved roaming around (table tennis table a nice plus!) and were made at home by all the staff. Our van driver could never get up the hill so the lovely staff would happily take out the tuk tuk to run us to town or drop us at the bottom of the hill. On our last day they even ran us down in the awesome old Beetle!! 

Location is excellent for both seeing Kandy and surrounding areas. 3 nights was a perfect length of stay - Kandy itself probably doesn’t warrant a vast amount of time but Villa Rosa is a treat and there are some lovely places to drive to for the day. 

Children were initially scared of the dogs but they are in fact the cutest, most friendly animals around. A pleasure to share the house with!! 

Highly, highly recommended, and amazing value for the quality on offer.","Fantastically good","2023-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d567271-r884782023-Villa_Rosa-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Take the half board option, and try to secure a room in the Sigiriya wing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed three nights in a Luxury Room in the Sigiriya Wing. The Heritance Kandalama is a massive and incredibly unique hotel - over 900 metres from one end of the Dambulla wing to the other end of the Sigiriya wing. 

The hotel is incredibly popular with large tourist groups (coaches and coaches worth) so if you are planning to stay here, book very early. We had a lot of difficulty securing a room at the hotel and were unable to book directly as they were sold out. We secured a room via a third party site, but not the one we were hoping for. We were on the third floor and had a partial lake and Sigiriya view. 

We had an issue with our room upon arrival (despite at least five pre arrival emails to the hotel), however it was resolved quite quickly after check in. 

The rooms are dated, but very comfortable and with good amenities. Everything worked fine and the AC and the bedding were great. The different types of resident monkeys visited our balcony and outside our bathroom daily which we quite enjoyed. 

The property and gardens / landscaping are beautiful and extremely unique. The infinity pool has incredible views over the lake and towards Sigiriya and the rooftop pool with the base of the pool the bed rock the hotel is built on is extremely unique and very cool. 

As the hotel has so many tour groups, it is very busy early in the mornings and in the evening, but super quiet and peaceful during the day when they are out.

We did the half board option which is highly advisable considering the isolated lakeside location. Breakfast was great every day, even when very busy with a good range of options. Dinner was great the first night, however the quality and range of options was a little poor on the second and third nights. 

We arranged transport out to Sigiriya for sunrise and for an elephant safari through the hotel and both were fantastic with good quality drivers and vehicles.

We found all staff at the hotel absolutely exceptional and friendly. The hotel bar charges in rupees which makes drink prices quite reasonable. 

We would absolutely recommend the Heritance Kandalama and really enjoyed our stay.","Heritance Kandalama brilliance","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r998219411-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, we were in awe of the striking architecture—this hotel is truly one of the most beautiful buildings we’ve ever seen. Designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa, it is perfectly sympathetic to the surrounding forest, blending seamlessly with nature and offering breathtaking views at every turn.

The food at Heritance Kandalama was amazing—a brilliant buffet. The variety was exceptional, and the quality was even better. We particularly loved the hoppers, daal, and the delicious selection of breads and fruits. There were also plenty of international food options for those who wanted them, ensuring that everyone’s tastes were satisfied. Every meal felt like a treat, and we enjoyed trying the local specialties every day.

The hotel’s three pools were a highlight, with the infinity pool offering the most breathtaking views of the nearby lake. It was the perfect place to unwind and take in the serene, peaceful surroundings. The entire hotel felt like an oasis—lush, beautiful, and incredibly calming. We spent time relaxing by the pools, soaking in the views, and enjoying the natural beauty all around us.

The nature surrounding the hotel is extraordinary. We loved watching the monkeys play and observing the wild birds that seemed to be everywhere. The sounds of the forest added a peaceful ambiance, making it easy to relax and feel truly connected to the environment. And the sunsets! They were simply incredible, casting a golden glow over the lake and the forest, creating a memory we’ll cherish forever.

The service at Heritance Kandalama was another standout feature. The staff were brilliant—professional, friendly, and attentive. They clearly take pride in their work and are great ambassadors for the hotel. This was our first experience of Sri Lanka, and we couldn’t have been made to feel more welcome. The staff were not only helpful but also genuinely interested in us, always going the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and their warm hospitality made our stay even more memorable.

We also had the privilege of experiencing some incredible nearby attractions. One of the standout experiences was walking with a monk. This meditation experience, where we visited caves and received the monk’s wisdom on the side of a mountain, was truly moving. It was a privilege to be in such a breathtaking setting and learn about Sri Lankan culture and spirituality.

We also climbed Sigiriya and Pidurangala, both of which were unmissable. While the sites can be crowded, the views from the top, especially at sunset, were absolutely worth it. The Dambulla caves, with their ancient and solemn atmosphere, made us feel like we were stepping back in time. The sense of history surrounding us was palpable, and we felt privileged to visit these sacred places.

Overall, Heritance Kandalama provided the perfect setting for a peaceful retreat—luxurious, connected to nature, and full of exceptional experiences. The combination of striking design, amazing food, brilliant service, and the chance to connect with nature made this stay unforgettable. We absolutely loved every moment and can’t wait to return.

The fact that architect Geoffrey Bawa designed it and it's a sustainable building were big sells, but I had my fingers crossed that this would be the place that I hoped it be. The minute we drove up to the hotel, jaws dropped. People were speechless at the views. Truly ""one in a lifetime"" surroundings with views of the UNESCO world site, Sigirya Rock. But what made this place so special was the staff, and how deeply they cared about making this an incredible experience for us and our guests. Gamini and Dimuth and all the staff took meticulous care in ensuring the food was perfect and the ceremony location was the best the hotel had to offer. The food here is amongst the best on the island, guests could not stop raving about the options and the chef's skill. The rooms were again, specatcular. The bathrooms are all glass and set in the jungle, so you'll often have monkeys flying about you as you bathe. 

It's one of the most stunning places on earth, and it'd be a shame to go your whole life without seeing this absolutely wonderous place. We were so blessed to have our wedding here.

He was attentive to our every need and would greet us every day with a charming smile inquiring how our stay at the hotel had been and whether there was anything the staff could do to enhance our experience. We had booked rooms with a 360 degree panoramic view but because we were on a lower floor, the view we had was of the surrounding jungle. When I discussed this with Shantha, he was very receptive, and imagine our amazement when we found that he had upgraded us to the Royal Suite free of charge. The marvellous views from our suites were absolutely breath taking and has given us such wonderful memories of our holiday at Kandalama. In addition, the food was delicious, the attention from the staff was par excellence, the hotel was clean and spotless and I would without doubt state that this was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.
Shantha has worked at the Heritance Kandalama Hotel for many years and is an absolute credit to the organisation that manages the hotel.

We are truly grateful for your gracious review. It brings us immense joy to know that your visit with us was a memorable one.

Your kind words will be shared with Dhanajaya, Kelum and the entire team—they will be deeply honored by your recognition.

We would be delighted to welcome you back for another indulgent escape. During your next visit, we invite you to explore our signature dining destinations: 1864, Fire Beach, and Traveler’s Bar—each offering a curated culinary journey, thoughtfully designed to reflect the elegance and spirit of GFH.

We are also thrilled to share a glimpse of what’s new: our beloved King of the Mambo has undergone an inspired transformation and will be relaunching ""Queens of the Mambo"" - a night of Cuban Beats and Bold Flavors topped off with free flowing cocktails for the ladies!  Likewise, Fire Beach has being reimagined to elevate your seaside dining experience to extraordinary new heights.

We eagerly await the pleasure of your return, where luxury, warmth, and exquisite experiences await.

With sincere appreciation,

Noel – GFH

The setting is absolutely stunning — a perfect blend of colonial charm and seaside elegance. We especially enjoyed the high tea on the terrace, with breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean and the gentle sea breeze adding to the ambience.

A special mention goes to Krishma, who made our high tea experience even more exceptional. She was warm, attentive, and incredibly professional — ensuring that everything ran smoothly and that we felt well taken care of throughout. Her thoughtful service really stood out and added a personal touch to an already wonderful afternoon.

I arrived at Araliya Resort and Spa on the 2nd of July, and my first impression was absolutely wonderful. The front desk team was very friendly, and the welcome I received was warm and professional. I would especially like to highlight Akila from the reception—he was exceptionally friendly and provided outstanding service from the moment I arrived.

The check-in process was smooth, and the escort from the lobby to the room was superb. It was truly the best service I’ve ever experienced. The Food & Beverage team was also very proactive, and the food at the Olive Restaurant was fantastic.

I highly recommend this hotel to both locals and foreigners traveling to Unawatuna. It offers great value for money and an unforgettable hospitality experience.

We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed our hospitality, the helpfulness of our staff—especially Gimhani—as well as the food, rooms, and overall service. We will be sure to pass on your kind wishes to Gimhani, who will be very encouraged by your words.

However, I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication you experienced during your telephone booking regarding birthday celebrations. This is certainly not the standard of service we strive to provide, and I understand how disappointing this must have been for you and your family. Please rest assured that we do offer special celebrations, and I regret that you were not informed in a timely manner to make those arrangements.

Your feedback is invaluable and will be used to improve our communication and booking process to ensure future guests do not face similar issues.

The veranda was perfectly set up to sit back and read a book taking in the beautiful environment. 

The hotel is perfectly located within the Fort to safely walk about day and night. 

The lady on reception was so bright, happy and engaging such a wonderful first impression. 

I can’t wait to return.","Perfect Fort location with great service.","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d15111854-r984867488-The_Heritage_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Only point is the room has no windows, on both sides it opens onto a passageway .., if one expects a room with a view then they will be disappointed, but this did not bother us as the location and overall experience more than made up for it .. will definitely recommend and stay again if in galle in the future.","Excellent stay","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d15111854-r983599607-The_Heritage_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

J’y ai séjourné du 19 au 29 mai . Il y avait quelques remarques négatives, en ce qui me concerne, franchement rien à signaler ! L’hôtel est vraiment sympa , la nourriture bonne ( certains se plaignent, j’aimerai bien voir ce qu’ils mangent chez eux ) la chambre était bien, propre , la Clim fonctionnait, salle de bain impeccable,  bon ! Chambre un peu humide mais on est en front de mer . La plage , c’était la marée haute et agitée, par contre , sur la gauche , une petite plage bordée de cocotiers, sauvage, déserte et à 5 mn a pieds , allez-y. Maintenant quelques conseils , j’ai fait l’excursion de 3 jours , j’ai adoré mais méfiez vous ! Monsieur Buddhi de DTH Travel , je l’appelerai Buddhi l’arnaque, j’ai payé 450 € , mes copines Léa et claire 415 , un couple de hollandais 400 , c’est à la tête du client , donc ne payez pas plus que 400, ça parait un peu cher mais franchement top , le parc national d’udawalawe , vous y verrez principalement des éléphants, le fameux train bleu 3h ne pas le faire , c’est comme venir à Paris et ne pas voir la Tour Eiffel, les paysages sont juste griandioses ! Plantations de thé, kandy , rocher du lion , sortie complète.il y a une ville galle , inutile de payer une sortie , demandez à la réception les horaires de trains , vous prenez un tuk tuk devant l’hôtel 3€ et le billet de train est à 1€ vous visiterez galle pour pas cher . Idem pour colombo le train de la même gare 3€ conseil prenez la seconde classe pas la 3 eme ! On dirait les wagons de trains de films western , beaucoup de monde , la 2 eme est à 1€ !  Pour les petits budgets les tuk tuk devant l’hôtel ont des catalogues et peuvent vous proposer toutes les sorties que vous souhaiter 2 fois moins cher , des gens l’ont fait et pas d’arnaque , vous monterez sur un éléphant plus cascade pour 20 balles , si vous souhaitez acheter des souvenirs , privilégiez Bentota , c’est moins cher , pour le thé c’est Ella ce n’etait pas beaucoup plus cher et thé d’exception , j’ai goûté et 8€ les 200g . Je vous rassure , on a mangé des crudités, personne n’est tombé malade . J’insiste si vous pouvez , prenez le train Ella kandy , le personnel de l’hôtel très gentil , souriant , c’est pauvre mais je n’ai pas vu de mendicité, une petite parenthèse, ma nuit à kandy , j’ais 6 singes sur le balcon , c’etait marrant . C’est très vert et les paysages sont juste magnifiques. Pas de tourisme de masse . Profitez bien si vous partez .

We had room 205, a standard room which was perfectly fine.  Stunning views of the pool and the ocean.  We saw reviews saying the beach was dirty and full of sandbags. We saw none of this. Staff cleaned the beach every morning and the hotel can't help the fact the sea was too rough to swim in. 
The bed was a little bit hard, but that's a personal thing. 
Food was lovely, and we didn't go hungry. There was always something to eat. And the warm puddings were amazing.  There was usually a roast at lunch and my only gripe was there wasn't any gravy. 
Staff are friendly, helpful and always smiling. 
The drinks are perfectly fine too. Measures are generous and the local gin was lovely. 
We booked our trips through a chap called Indica, on the beach. Brilliant value for money.
Loved the tuk tuks, which you can get outside the hotel and are very cheap. 
We absolutely loved our 2 weeks here and really didn't want to leave. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to return.","Amazing hotel, beautiful country","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r1015345417-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful from arrival and always greet you with a smile. 

The food was especially good with great variety of dishes. They also have a grill option. The deserts were presented beautifully and varied day by day. 

The room was stunning with an amazing view of the sea and was spotless each day. We had a deluxe room, which had a delightful surprise of a jacuzzi bath and stunning sea views from the balcony. 

The pool was lovely and they had three staff members just dedicated to helping by the pool which was really nice. The sun loungers faced the beach which was lovely. There was also always security outside the hotel along the beach and pool which made it feel really safe which was great. They were really nice and would always smile.

We did excursions with TUI and bentota travel which were great and the hotel prepared us lots of breakfast bags every time we went out early for day trips. 

Overall this was an amazing hotel and we would really recommend it!","Fabulous hotel","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d611903-r1013945191-Pandanus_Beach_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We checked in on 28th June and stayed one night at Araliya Resort & Spa Unawatuna, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish!

The panoramic views and infinity pool were absolutely stunning—unlike anything we've experienced before. The easy beach access, kids club, play area, and lively DJ and music kept the whole family entertained and excited throughout our stay.

The food selection was excellent, offering a wide variety that made every meal feel special. Room No. 922 will always hold a special place in our hearts.

A heartfelt thank you to Mr. Rasanga Nawarathna, Dimuthu, and the entire team for their warm hospitality, excellent guidance, and thoughtful care. You all made our short stay truly delightful.

However, the changing rooms were not well-maintained and had a strong odor, which detracted from our overall experience. With a bit of improvement in facilities, this resort could truly shine.

The location is perfect for relaxation, offering a serene atmosphere. It’s a great spot for groups, with plenty of activities and a family friendly environment, making it ideal for kids. The well maintained garden adds to the natural beauty of the place.  

The rooms were comfortable, with some featuring balconies facing the beach, while others overlook the pool area. We stayed for two nights, one on Full Board and one on Half Board, and found everything well organized. The bathrooms were clean, with hot water, and the linen was fresh and tidy.

The two pools were clean and well maintained, providing ample space to unwind and enjoy. While the beach was a bit rough, the hotel ensured it was kept clean, making for a pleasant coastal experience.  

Last but not least, the food..! The variety was excellent, with both Sri Lankan and international cuisine available. The chef and restaurant staff were incredibly helpful, making dining a memorable experience. We especially enjoyed Saturday’s BBQ night, which was a fantastic addition..!

Since there were fewer guests, our last two meals (dinner & breakfast) on Half Board were served à la carte. Despite this, the chef and restaurant staff made sure we were not disappointed, providing exceptional service. They even went out of their way to accommodate special requests for our two kids, ensuring they got exactly what they wanted, even if it wasn’t on the menu..!

Thank you for your heartfelt review and for choosing the Mermaid Hotel & Club as the final stop on your Sri Lankan journey.

We’re so pleased to hear that you found peace and relaxation with us after your busy tour. It brings us great joy to know our team made you feel truly cared for and that the culinary experience — both European and Sri Lankan — exceeded your expectations. We’ll be sure to pass your compliments on to our chef and restaurant team.

Even the rainy weather couldn’t dampen your spirits, and for that, we are truly grateful. We hope to welcome you back for another restful stay — next time with a bit more sunshine and just the right amount of food!

","Value","5","Location","5","Service","5",,,,,,,"My husband and I had to visit family in Galle and rather than coming back on same day, both of us wanted to experience the present Galle Fort @ night. My husband's family were living inside Galle Fort for over 5 decades and their house is now a Villa owned by a foreigner. 
We were looking at all options to stay over for one night and our main criteria was to get with car parking . There was only one option The Heritage which had car park in the premises and matched our requirements. Our room was on the top floor facing the garden and we could see restaurant beyond. Though the rooms are on 1 and 2nd floors above ground there is an elevator to take us up and down. 
Staying inside Galle Fort gave us the opportunity of walking along the ramparts in the evening as done by us when the family lived on Parawa Street. This brought us many memories. It was a good choice of selecting The Heritage (previously known as 'Kotuwe Kade') which gave us good rest to sleep in. Room was very comfortable with all amenities and the bed was great. Washroom and the Toilet looked brand new with good flow of hot and cold water. 
One of the special item that caught my eye as I checked in was the antique telephone that is used as an intercom. 
One more I would like to comment is the room service. Next day we tried making morning tea and noticed that the kettle was not working and we informed. Within a matter of few minutes we heard a tap on the door and one of the staff is there with a spare kettle. We valued the splendid service. 
Overall the staff was very friendly - room service, the restaurant and whom we spoke with during our stay. 
Food was good and we selected the Sri Lankan menu. They had hoppers, Pan Cake, Milk Rice and String Hoppers with suitable curries to match with. There was a flow of fruits as deserts. 
Overall our stay was pleasant and enjoyable leaving behind lasting memories.

We really enjoyed the breakfast which was a choice of European or Sri Lankan, what a feast, fruit platter,  pastries, eggs, toast plus juice, tea and coffee. The only negative was the coffee, I am super fussy and it wasn’t to my liking.

Having stayed in many of the hotels in Galle Fort I would definitely choose The Heritage Hotel again. We didn’t eat in the restaurant but friends did and they were impressed with the selection of delicious vegetarian curries. 

The location is very central on Church Street where a nice choice of restaurants and other hotels are located. The Pasta Factory opposite the gates serves truly authentic Italian fare. For a Latte or Cappuccino fix it has to be Fort Bazzar on Church Street.

Its a quiet, clean, spacious hotel with wonderfully warm and friendly staff. Our room was large with probably the largest bed we had ever slept on and the bathroom was also spacious. We loved the huge veranda with comfy lounge chairs, a perfect place for reading and chilling. On site free parking is a huge bonus for a hotel inside the Fort. 
The food is very good and the Sri Lankan coffee is excellent. The lovely garden with Araliya trees next to the dining area is very relaxing. The spa is small but the therapists are excellent and the prices are reasonable.

Breakfast was served rather than a buffet - this did not bother us and the food was plentiful and delicious. 

We did miss a pool to cool off in, later in the day but we went over to the beach at the lighthouse to cool off and it worked well.

The only negative we have is that the 2nd night we stayed there was a function in the open air restaurant right below our room. It went until past 3am and had speakers playing a religious chant every 3 seconds from early evening - we didnt sleep at all. 

We understand that it was a religious expectation but a warning or apology would have been nice.

The building was restored in 2003 and features 14 suite rooms today. I highly recommend their breakfast. They have a Sri Lankan and a Western option — I always go for Sri Lankan, because I can make eggs myself any day of the week.

What really sets this hotel apart from all the others is the people. They went above and beyond to help, would always smile and say hello when we saw them, and took a genuine interest in us. Nothing was too much trouble. Thilini on reception, Shanushka (who we gave the nickname ""the nice guy"" before we knew his name), and Sidath the manager were absolutely amazing. Nahlinda, our TukTuk guy also deserves a shout out even though he isn't technically part of the restaurant staff.

Location wise there are an absolute tonne of restaurants, cafes, shops, museums etc that you can walk to in 2 or 3 minutes. It is only a 10 minute journey to the beach by TukTuk, and there are temples, spice farms, and lots of wildlife to visit nearby!

the bed was ginormous and the room was very clean, although a bit dark but that is just the way they are built. the room comes with a fridge and A/C and you get two little bottles of water every day. 
the building itself is in the colonial style with one huge balcony area where you access the rooms. there are lovely loungers outside each room where you can relax. 

the staff were superb, absolutely lovely and wonderful. starting with the maintenance and cleaning crew who made sure we stayed toped up with water, coffee etc, they even left the things outside the door the one day we forgot to remove the do not disturb sign. 
Also our waiter, Sunimal and the chef Udesh were so friendly, polite and attenuative and the breakfast was not only delicious but it was everything you wanted, so much food we were set all day. 
and a big thank you also to Lakshani and Hirudima for making us so welcome overall in their hotel.

Due to the Covid 19 Pandemic the hotel was with Zero foreign guests but the garden and the rooms were well maintained. The rooms are spacious with king size beds and large bath rooms. The restaurant serves you delicious meals with well attentive service. And their rate during this period is well affordable for the locals and hopefully the hotel might not having huge margins during this time. Sidath the Resident Manager was very helpful and personally attend on the requests of any guests. Finally we highly recommend this property and once the pandemic is over hope you will visit Sri Lanka and stay The Heritage Hotel Galle Fort.

The room was well equipped with crisp clean linen and even bathrobes and toilet slippers. The room had a mini bar and hair dryer as well. The washroom had bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. So you only have to bring your toothbrush and tooth paste with you! The air conditioner worked very well. And the bed was very comfortable. 

The hotel is very central and walking distance from all the sites, shops and restaurants. And we felt very safe walking even after 9.30pm. 

We enjoyed sitting on the large balcony on the easy chairs (hansi putu) just looking over the lovely garden full of Frangipani Trees and rooftops. 

The food was good specially the western breakfast, Pol Roti breakfast and sweet corn soup at dinner! Yummy!

The hotel is nicely located in the Fort, and has a surprisingly spacious area with ample car parking within the property. We got a free upgrade to the suite which was a nice touch as well.  The suite is spacious with a small sitting room, large bedroom area with two double beds (ideal for a small family) and a decent sized bathroom with shower and bathtub. The beds are comfortable, there are plenty of pillows and the AC units work very well which is welcome in the relentless heat when the sun is out. There is a lift to access the first and second floors as well, so helpful for the elderly and differently abled.

The restaurant is also spacious and airy, open concept facing a courtyard of araliya trees. We had the dinner buffet (due to rain) which proved to be for the best as the spread was wonderful - the prawn curry in particular was exceptional! Breakfast was an equally fulfilling affair with a nice mix of Western and Sri Lankan delights. Salutations to the Chef for doing a fantastic job.

The staff are genuinely warm and friendly. Sidath (Resident Manager) and his team go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. They were always inquiring about our well-being and very accommodating to requests - we requested a newspaper in the morning and it was there before 7am! Managing Director Manjari was present at the hotel as well and is also a warm personality who makes guests feel at home.

The room had high ceilings and was very cool, but lacked windows, having only carved wooden grilles placed high up and a shutter arrangement behind the mirror which was difficult to get at.  This made the room seem rather dark and claustrophobic.
We arrived just as Galle Fort was starting to shut down due to the Covid 19 restrictions, so there were very few people staying there and restaurants were closing.
The Sri Lankan breakfast was delicious, consisting of two kinds of hoppa, dosai and coconut rotti with dhal, fish and meat curries, and two types of sambal; we barely dented it.  Western-style breakfasts were good too.  Having stayed in lots of isolated places, going out for dinner was a joy.

However, the location is great, and the fort area is an enjoyable experience, even though it is aimed at fleecing the tourist. The hotel has character, and we found the staff to be really friendly and helpful. The food was good, although we struggled to eat the large portions. The breakfast was far too much for us, but we managed to all cram in a few extra egg hoppers each! On the last day the waiter even made us a packed lunch from the leftovers. His name is Chiradh, and so we send him our thanks. The best waiter for the whole two weeks award, however, goes to a really friendly member of staff called mr Sunimal; he really looked after us, and helped make our stay really good!

My sister had a birthday while we were there and we were treated to a room upgrade to the Royal Suite for the last 4 nights of our stay. The suite was absolutely stunning with its own pool, jacuzzi, and made our trip even more special.

Danajaya and Chathuri on reception were so lovely as were all of the staff working in the restaurant area who were always so polite, friendly and happy to help. The young man who prepared the special birthday table was a real star.
