From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with genuine warmth. The young staff was incredibly hospitable and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable.

We stayed in a spacious bungalow with a private pool, which was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities, including thoughtful touches like disposable toothbrushes and shaving kits. The shared pool area was also lovely, and the sunbeds right on the beach made relaxing even easier.

We opted for the half board option. On the first evening and morning, meals were served buffet-style, but due to fewer guests on the following days, the meals were à la carte—which was actually a nice change. On our last evening, dinner was beautifully served on the beach, which made the experience even more special.

A special thank you goes to Sanjay, one of the waiters, whose kindness and attentiveness truly made our stay unforgettable.

If I could offer one suggestion to the management, it would be to make the main restaurant and the two beachside restaurants a bit cozier in terms of atmosphere, as they currently feel a bit stark.

All in all, highly recommended for anyone looking for a relaxing and personal beach getaway!","Wonderful Stay at Uppuveli Beach By DSK","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d28052030-r1009387041-Uppuveli_Beach_By_Dsk-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

Although I tried many hotels during my stay, The Sheraton Kosgoda stood out for it's great guest experience. The reception is open and pretty and we were greeted with a delicious fruit drink. Check in was easy and the reception team was top notch. We were assigned a team member (Marlon) to take care of all our needs during our stay and he was fabulous and able to answer any question we had and even giving us a great dinner recommendation in the area. He was always on call for us with a cell phone number we were given to reach him directly. Amazing customer service.
The rooms are large, pristine clean, fresh and the beds comfortable - nothing to complain about. We were touched with a welcome box full of sweet treats and a fruit basket ( probably because of our Marriott status I think) there was a personalized note as well. At every turn in the hotel, the customer service and politeness was excellent, smiles and good mornings and good nights by everyone, even the groundskeepers and cleaning crew. the grounds are kept beautifully with a huge pool area. The drinks and bites at the pool bar were unique interesting and not watered down. The breakfast buffet was overwhelming with so many stations and you had no room to try everything. The local food was delicious and the breakfast staff too were courteous. fresh hoppers was a treat! and the Seeni sambol best I had on the island. This hotel had some of the best food we had on the island. Overall, a very pleasant and comfortable stay with superior quality amenities, and service. The hotel is easily accessible  to the elephant safari, and the turtle hatchery which is a must visit is conveniently located a few minutes walk on the beach next door, We felt so welcome and cannot wait to return.","Superior customer service and attention to detail","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r1016902656-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

We’re delighted to hear that you enjoyed the ambiance of the property, the beach access, and the warm hospitality from our Sales and Front Office teams. It’s also wonderful to know that Chef S.K.

Das Hotel ist sehr gepflegt, mit großen und sauberen Zimmern – genau das, was man sich für einen erholsamen Aufenthalt wünscht.

Das Essen war hervorragend: Es gab immer etwas anderes, eine große Auswahl und alles hat sehr gut geschmeckt. Auch die Getränke waren lecker – die All-Inclusive-Getränkekarte war zwar nicht riesig, aber vollkommen in Ordnung.

Der Strand war schön, allerdings könnte er sauberer sein. Durch die hohen Wellen war das Schwimmen leider nicht immer möglich.

Ein großer Minuspunkt war, dass Gäste ohne All-Inclusive manchmal bevorzugt behandelt wurden – das hat leider den Gesamteindruck etwas getrübt.

Ein echtes Highlight war jedoch Bandu, der am Strand Touren anbietet. Er ist super freundlich und geht individuell auf alle Wünsche ein. Wir haben ihm gesagt, was wir sehen möchten, und daraufhin hat er perfekte, maßgeschneiderte Touren für uns organisiert. Sein Auto ist sehr sauber und gepflegt, er fährt ruhig und sicher – was im verrückten Verkehr dort wirklich wichtig ist. Und: Seine Preise sind deutlich günstiger als beim Reiseveranstalter! Bandu spricht sehr gutes Englisch, Deutsch und sogar Russisch.

Ganz klare Empfehlung: Wenn ihr Touren machen wollt, dann nur mit Bandu! Seine WhatsApp-Nummer ist: +94 (77) 783 6537

Mr. Nuwan, the Resident Manager, went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and happy. He even personally checked in on us during meals. Front office staff Wasantha and Isuru were so helpful and knowledgeable – always ready to assist with a smile and provide great travel tips. Priyantha, the Restaurant Manager, deserves special praise. His service was five-star; he managed his team with elegance and made sure every dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. The breakfast and dinner menus were varied and delicious, and the lakeside dining atmosphere made it even more special. Our room was cozy, clean, and full of character. We loved the quiet and calm environment, perfect after a day of exploring ancient ruins. EKHO Lake House truly combines old-world charm with warm hospitality.

 Our room on the ground floor was immaculate  clean with a large bathroom and flowers on the bed a great touch. We were able to step out of our room through our balcony to a great pool ideal for cooling down on a hot sunny afternoon or watching children have fun swimming safely.There was even a swim up bar what more could you want

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with grace and warmth. The resort is breathtaking — surrounded by nature, beautifully landscaped, and set against the backdrop of the stunning southern coastline. It offered the perfect balance of luxury, tranquility, and Sri Lankan charm.

Our room was spacious, spotless, and elegantly decorated, with thoughtful honeymoon touches that made us feel truly special. The view from our balcony was absolutely serene, and every detail reflected the resort’s world-class standards.

The food was exceptional — from breakfast to dinner, every meal was a delight. We also loved the range of activities and the peaceful atmosphere of the pool and gardens. Most of all, we were touched by the kindness and professionalism of the staff, who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable, relaxing, and memorable.

Thank you, Shangri-La Hambantota, for being part of our honeymoon journey. You helped create memories we will treasure for a lifetime. We look forward to returning in the years ahead.

**Hotel Facilities and Atmosphere:**
The hotel had plenty of space, and the grounds were nice, offering ample room to relax. The beach sea was quite rough, making it unsuitable for swimming. The hotel was quiet from Monday to Thursday, with weekends being busier, especially with locals, but still maintaining a spacious feel.

The pools were excellent, with a good kids' pool, an infinity adult pool, and a family pool. All of them offered plenty of space and warm water, allowing us to stay in all day.

One area for improvement was the evening entertainment. There wasn't much available, which was a shame given the suitability of the grounds for such activities. Even some music in the lobby after dinner would have been appreciated, as evenings felt like there was nothing to do but return to our rooms.

**Food:**
The buffet breakfast offered a good selection. For dinner, while a la carte options were available, we never saw anyone utilizing them, which made them less inviting. The buffet had Indian, Sri Lankan, and Asian offerings, but it became a bit repetitive after a few days, and the vegetarian selection was limited. It was also frustrating that the dinner options were better from Friday to Sunday, which felt unfair to us since we were there for both weekdays and weekends.

**Drinks:**
Alcoholic drinks were very expensive, even by UK standards, unless they were local brands. The bars also lacked atmosphere, so they weren't places we felt inclined to simply go and relax unless we specifically wanted a drink.

**Excursions:**
We used the hotel for three days of trips, and our driver, Janaka, was excellent and knowledgeable. He struck the perfect balance of providing information and allowing us to explore, and we would definitely use him again. I suspect that organizing excursions through the hotel might be more expensive than arranging them yourself, but it certainly offers a hassle-free experience.

**Spa:**
We had a treatment at the spa, which was excellent.

**Summary:**
Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and its facilities. I would rate it a 4-star experience, with the main areas for improvement being the dinner options and the evening entertainment.

Staff were all very good throughout. 

Please note that the hotel is about a 3.5-hour drive from Colombo airport (as we do not fly to the local one). The roads and highways are good, but this adds to the overall travel time door-to-door.","Great Trip - some minor improvement could make it amazing","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1015986711-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Nuwara Eliya and this area of the central highlands are truly beautiful and well worth visiting and exploring before heading up to Ella. And when you do you must stay at Chimneys! 

Everything was just wonderful - the beautiful, comfortable room, the amazing and adorable staff, the delicious breakfast and food. It was a ture experience just to stay in this beautiful building and the amazing staff made the stay even more unforgetable. 

A special mention to Dave, Krishnan and the excellent chef. My wife and I got engaged on our trip in Sri Lanka and when the staff at Chimneys found out they went out of their way to make us feel even more special. It was a joy to share the excitement with them. Later on check out we made a mistake with the payment and caught the train up to Ella before we realised. Dave came all the way to Ella on motorbike to resolve the issue (sorry again Dave!) for which we are truly grateful. Absolutely top hospitality and we only wish we could have stayed longer. 

Chimenys is one of our three favourite hotels in the whole world! It is our dream to return to Chimneys and Sri Lanka one day!

Wir haben ein tolles Zimmer bekommen, großzügig geschnitten, toller Ausblick, luxuriöses Bad. Alles im englischen Landhausstil, schöner Garten, „very British“, very stylish. Jeder Wunsch wurde uns von den Lippen abgelesen.
Kleiner Wermutstropfen: Das Essen! Wir hatten Weißwein zum Essen bestellt, es gab noch EIN Glas. Wir fragten nach Rotwein, es gab noch EINE Flasche. Das Essen wurde unmittelbar nach dem Hinsetzen serviert, noch vor irgendwelchen Getränken. Alles sehr hektisch. Man hatte die Wahl zwischen typisch Sri-lankischem Essen und  „westlichem“ Essen. Wir haben westlich gewählt, das Essen war gerade eben so ok…. Am Nachbartisch gab es Reis und Curry, das sah deutlich besser aus. 
Alles zusammen: Ein großartiger Ort, mit etwas Potential zur Weiterentwicklung.

The Nuwara Eliya town tends to turn into a traffic jam on holidays and long weekends and the never ending concerts (if you can call them that) at the banks of Gregory Lake can get a bit tedious. I was so thrilled when I found out that I could no longer hear the ghastly music coming from the banks of Gregory Lake once I got to this property :)))

The property is situated in a lovely location bordering the Galways land national park. So, if you are looking for a place not too far from the town but away from all the crowds and noise this is the ideal location. 

It's not the usual colonial bungalow but has a slightly more modern European vibe to it and tastefully decorated. The room was very spacious. My favorite part was the lovely window seat. 

The staff was very courteous and attentive. Special mention must be made of Kishan who served us. The food was a set menu, but taste wise it was excellent. And we also noticed that even though the place wasn't crowded, they needed a little extra time to prepare the meals. But to be fair, each time we were informed in advance as to how long they would take.

The access road was in good condition and the Google map directions were accurate. But a more prominent name board at the property would have been help as it took us a little time to find the correct entrance.

They also have two very friendly doggies who may have contributed to my rating ;)

I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to chill in peace and quiet....","Away from the crowds","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d23864787-r996527696-Chimneys_Nuwara_Eliya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The staff went out of their way to ensure that we had a comfortable stay. Special thanks to Mr. Inshaf, Front Desk Executive, who took care of even our smallest need. I travelled along with my Mum and sister, and all of us were deeply satisfied with our stay.
Important Information for anyone reading this:
1. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel ( a cafe, a buffet/ a la carte restaurant and a rooftop bar cum restaurant) and food options are plenty. The food is really good and comes at a reasonable price (as compared to other places that we explored).
2. The staff is extremely courteous and even arranges for sightseeing tours at different price. If anyone is taking a trip to Kandy, Pinawalla or Galle, ask for Mr. Udeesha. He is the best. We made two full day trips with him and honestly, it was the safest and warmest experience we have had ever.
3. The washrooms are clean and regular housekeeping is maintained.
4. While booking, select the sea facing rooms. It comes at a higher price than other rooms but definitely worth every penny.
5. Options for breakfast buffet is available. The spread is good 👍🏻","Best stay in Colombo, undoubtedly!","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d24014431-r978785935-MaRadha_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

MaRadha has a great location, overlooking the ocean. The rooms are modern and well appointed. We had booked the interconnected family rooms which were spacious for 3 adults and 3 kids.
The rooms had large glass pane windows with uninterrupted views of the ocean, right across the hotel.
There is plunge pool on the rooftop, which ahits at 6 PM, as the bar funstions here post that time. So , plan to go before that or in the morning. You can enjoy a geeatview from the pool and relax.
The breakfast is good with western and Sri Lankan options. Kids have a lot of options to choose from.
The staff here was very polite and courteous. I coordinated with Shanika over whatsapp and booking was seamless and efficient. 
The location is good, once reach restaurants and malls by a short drive easily .

Плюсы: 
Еда выше всяких похвал, прекрасный сервис, всегда приветливый персонал, готовый помочь с любым вопросом. Номера довольно аскетичные, но все удобства есть: кондиционер, телевизор, фен; уборка ежедневно. 
Много спортивных площадок на территории: волейбол, теннис, бадминтон, футбол - все что душе угодно.
Минус: рядом есть только один магазин с достаточно ограниченным выбором продуктов. 
Внутри отеля есть сувенирные лавки, при желании территорию можно даже не покидать. 
В шаговой доступности есть рестораны. 
На мой взгляд, отель подойдет всем: и любителям расслабленного отдыха, и тем, кто любит активности.","Чудесный отпуск на берегу Индийского океана","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612379-d506916-r1014322361-Club_Palm_Bay-Marawila_North_Western_Province.html",

Thank you so much for your heartfelt and detailed review. We’re truly delighted to know that you and your husband chose to spend your December vacation with us and that your stay left you with such warm memories.

It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed the comfort of our spacious bungalows, the variety and quality of our all-inclusive meals, and the beauty of our surroundings — from the gardens and friendly peacocks to the stunning sunsets by the sea. While the ocean can sometimes be too rough for swimming, we’re glad our large, multi-depth pool provided a relaxing alternative.

We’re also pleased to hear you made time to explore Sri Lanka with a trip to Nuwara Eliya and enjoyed the evening entertainment back at the hotel. Thank you for your kind words about our attentive and friendly team — they’ll be very happy to know they made a positive impact on your stay.

We do appreciate your feedback regarding the excursions and the unexpected extra charges at various stops, as well as your note about the long drive back. We’ll take this into account and pass it along to the relevant partners for future improvements.

Your kind recommendation means a great deal to us, and while we understand you usually don’t return to the same place twice, we would be thrilled to welcome you back someday.

Нам очень понравился отель, он состоит из 40 бунгало. Комната большая, всё есть для отличного отдыха. Комнату убирали каждый день. Питание всё включено - очень разнообразное, салаты, мясо, пирожные , мороженое всё супер вкусное. У отеля огромная территория, ходят павлины, вараны....
Море рядом , оно такое тёплое, красивое, очень красивые закаты. Но часто бывают волны и купаться нельзя. Но на территории есть огромный бассейн, он поделён на участки с разной глубиной. 
Ездили на экускусию в Нувара Элия  на два дня. В целом экскурсия понравилась. Не понравилось то, что на каждой остановке надо платить, то есть к слонам при ехали -заплати ,чтобы их покормить, к черепахам тоже самое) Об этом не предупреждают организаторы. И ещё нюанс. У нас был водитель и экскурсовод Рома-дома, ему было тяжело одному, на обратном пути он как-будто засыпал и приходилось его подбадривать всю дорогу. 
Вечерами была живая музыка или представление с танцами.... Понравилось вообще ВСЁ!!!!! Постоянно с тоской вспоминаю это умиротворенное , живописное место.... Не в моих правилах отдыхать в одном и том же месте, но сюда я бы еще вернулась!

Another of our favorite experiences during our visit as a family was the indoor play area for children, ""Little Hatchlings."" It was well planned, clean, and full of engaging activities that our son was fascinated with for hours. Surprisingly, the staff even offered him a set of puzzles to solve, which added such a special and individual touch to the visit.

Thank you so much for sharing your unforgettable experience at Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort. We’re truly honored that you chose to celebrate your birthday with us, and even more delighted to know that our team helped make it a special and memorable occasion for you and your family.

Your heartfelt compliments mean the world to us. We’re especially pleased to hear that Nadja Dissanayaka made such a positive impact during your stay. His dedication to providing personalized and attentive service truly reflects the spirit of hospitality we strive to offer each and every guest. We will be sure to pass along your kind words to him and the rest of the restaurant team, who will be thrilled to know their efforts stood out to you.

We're also grateful for your recognition of how our team handled the challenges you encountered during your stay. It’s our priority to respond to feedback quickly and effectively, and your acknowledgment is deeply appreciated.

Thank you as well for your honest feedback regarding the beach experience. While our beachfront is public, as is customary in Sri Lanka, we understand that guest comfort and privacy are paramount, and we are continually working on improving how we guide and support our guests in navigating such interactions.

It was a pleasure having you with us, and we’re so glad you left with such fond memories. We truly hope to welcome you and your family back for another wonderful holiday in the near future.

One of the highlights was celebrating my birthday during our stay. The hotel staff made it a truly special occasion with thoughtful touches and warm hospitality that really impressed us.

A very special thanks goes to our Guest Relations Officer, Mr. Nadja Dissanayaka. He was always approachable, extremely friendly, and handled all our requests with great care and professionalism. His personal attention made a real difference and is something you don’t experience every day.

We also want to express our appreciation for the restaurant staff – always courteous, attentive, and welcoming. The food was without a doubt the best all-inclusive experience we've ever had! The variety and quality were outstanding – something we definitely noticed on the scale afterwards 😉

During our stay, we did encounter a few challenges – which can happen anywhere. What stood out here, however, was the excellent way the hotel management handled these issues. Everything was addressed quickly and professionally. That kind of service truly sets this hotel apart.

The resort itself is beautiful, with modern, clean, and comfortable rooms. The pool area is great for relaxing, and the entire property is well maintained.

One small downside – which is typical across Sri Lanka – is that the hotel doesn't have a private beach. While beach access is easy and direct from the hotel, you may be approached by locals more frequently than you’d like, which some guests might find intrusive.

Bottom line: We had a fantastic time at the Sheraton Kosgoda and left with amazing memories. We highly recommend this hotel and would love to come back again!","Unforgettable Stay at Sheraton Kosgoda – Truly Exceptional!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d19761154-r1009304372-Sheraton_Kosgoda_Turtle_Beach_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much for taking the time to share such a detailed and heartfelt review of your recent stay at Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort.

We’re delighted to know that you had a great experience and that our associates – especially Dilhara, Abdullah, and Dishan – made a lasting impression with their warmth, expertise, and genuine care. We’ll be sure to pass along your kind words to them; they will be thrilled to know they contributed to your memorable stay.

It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed the variety and quality of our culinary offerings, and we truly value your feedback regarding food waste during the off-season. We are continuously working on optimizing our buffet operations to balance variety with sustainability.

We’re also pleased that you appreciated the spacious rooms, well-maintained pool, and the unique opportunity to witness turtle conservation just steps away from the resort.

Your constructive comments are equally appreciated – especially regarding the All-Inclusive beverage access and beach cleanliness. We take your feedback seriously and will explore ways to improve both these aspects for a more seamless and enjoyable guest experience.

Thank you again for choosing to stay with us. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future for another memorable seaside escape.

Alle sind enorm freundlich.
Im Restaurant hatten wir mit Dilhara und Abdullah 2 Kellner die ihren Job in Perfektion beherrschen. Mich hat es enorm beeindruckt, dass sie zu Rückfragen zu Gerichten auch immer das Rezept parat hatten. Das wirkte nie auswendig gelernt. Tips für Ausflüge und auch was man dort vermeiden sollte gab es auch von den beiden. 
Das Essen war fantastisch. Die Auswahl war sehr groß, manchmal zu groß. Wir waren in der Nebensaison hier und nicht viel Gäste, da tat mir das im Herzen weh zu sehen was übrig bleibt. 
Die Zimmer sind groß und schön eingerichtet, das Bett hatte aber schon einige Gäste gesehen. 
Der Pool ist sehr groß und sehr gepflegt. Bei Dishan konnten wir uns immer Poolnudeln, Luftmatratze, Schildkröte Erika und Co. ausleihen, er war immer zum Spaß aufgelegt.
Was man optimieren könnte, mit All Inklusive hat man nur in 2 von 4 Bars die Möglichkeit etwas zu trinken. Die eine ist draußen, die andere im Restaurant. Bei Regen war das draußen nicht optimal, obwohl überdacht.  
50 Meter weiter am Strand findet man direkt die Schildkröten Station. Man kann die Schildkröten dort ins Meer lassen.  Ein Erlebnis an das man sich ein Leben lang erinnert.

Thank you also for sharing your thoughts on nearby destinations — it's helpful for future travelers.

Welcome ceremony for new guests. Last night we were offered by the hotel manager a High tea for free (probably because we stayed there so long), this made a memorable impression to us. Sandy beach just in front of the hotel, clean sea however big waves (April) even adults might have problems. The beach by the hotel is about 1Km wide,  nice and without rocks, however the whole coastline is rocky, almost no possibility to swim. I would say better beach is in Bentota (12 km away), however more people there. Anyway we were happy on the hotel’s beach, because we were almost alone and romantic scenery especially at sunset. Kosgoda is a small village with limited shop possibilities, modern supermarket cca. 500 meters away, ATM, some local grocery shops. We went also to Hikkaduwa beach, but were disappointed, too many people, hotels, rocks, no shade.
The excursions organized by the travel agency were quite expensive, we were lucky to meet Amal Perera by chance, he lives in Kosgoda and we went on two excursions together, Sinharaja rain forest and Udawalawe NP by car for a very reasonable price. Gives you fixed price in advance with no hidden costs.

This is a great hotel - a small boutique hotel on the edge of the lake with great staff, service and ambience. It is also very  closely located to the ruins in Polonnaruwa.

Priyahntha Koralegedara (the Senior Guest Manager) was fantastic and did a great job looking after us.

We loved our big room with the big bed, great bathroom and separate dressing room.  The view out across the lake was stunning.

The food was fantastic - great Sri Lankan breakfast and the Sri Lankan curries for dinner were so tasty.  Spicy but not burning hot ........ great food.

It is worth staying a few nights here to explore the surrounding countryside.

Our room was clean, comfortable, and had a beautiful view of the lake. Dining was another highlight — Hasitha, the restaurant manager, ensured everything ran smoothly. The food was delicious, especially the Sri Lankan dishes.

A special thanks to Wasantha for his friendly service during breakfast and dinner. He always served with a smile and made sure we had what we needed.

The location is convenient, right in the heart of Colombo and just across from the beach—though it’s important to note that you have to cross a busy road to reach the shore, so it’s not as private or serene as some other Taj properties.

The pool was decent, but felt a bit underwhelming after the stunning one at Taj Bentota. On the plus side, the food was  good, and a special mention goes to the passion fruit jam at breakfast—absolutely delightful!

Our room was neat and comfortable, though we missed having a balcony, especially in a coastal city. Also, the lawns and outdoor areas felt a bit neglected, not quite up to the usually impeccable Taj standards.

In summary, Taj Samudra offers good service and a prime city location, but could benefit from some updates and better outdoor maintenance to truly live up to the Taj brand.","Exploring new horizons 🇱🇰🎊✨️","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1015349302-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Reception staff were helpful, kind and quick at work.
Huge property close to a beach.
Room and bathroom are spacious. Enjoyed my cup of coffee with the view of a beautiful Sunrise outside at the balcony!
Concrete cement is used as table in the room.  There are cracks already and the coffee stain of coffee from cups on it are evident.  If regular maintenance is ignored, this property will lose its charm.  So ensure attention is given.
Spoon and cup that I wanted to use was oily, need to be washed thoroughly.
Birds, squirrel in the balcony garden with the the lush greenery was a plus!
Restaurant food was plenty.  But the problem was the burners were not lite and this caused the chafing dishes to be cold.  I told the staff there, but nothing was done and I left without taking food from the chafing dishes.  Staff at the restaurant were friendly and kind.  The restaurant needs ventilation to keep away the aroma of food lingering on clothes after visit to the restaurant.","Uppuveli Beach By Dsk, Trincomalee, Sri Lanka","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d28052030-r1002449208-Uppuveli_Beach_By_Dsk-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

We were in Ocean View Suite and the room is size of a 2 bedroom apartment with amazing views and swings. The best thing to remember is how friendly and supportive the staff is. Starting from the reception, room service, pool, restaurant and even the staff who are not customer facing are so friendly.  Out of all Kanishka in Bojunhala restaurant is the BEST. I need to mention him as he was very kind, supportive and friendly. Keep up the good work and smile always. And to mention the food is very tasty. They had a wide variety of food selection with many action stations. Chef Ladies in the hoppers station are very friendly. There are 3 massive pools and the best part is kids pool if you have little kids. While we were here we had amazing experiences and treatment. We will definitely visit here again.","Best Resort in South Asia!!!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1012456099-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

1. die ""Hardware"": das Hotel hat während unseres Aufenthalts gerade seinen 9. Geburtstag gefeiert. Für ein Hotel dieses Alters ist es in einem sehr guten Zustand und wird ständig renoviert und instandgehalten.
Zimmer:
Die Suite ist mit 96m² sehr groß, hat ein tolles Wohn- und Esszimmer, ein Schlafzimmer, Ankleide, und ein Bad mit Badewanne und Dusche. Doch das Beste an der Suite ist der unglaubliche Ausblick vom 3.Stock aus (Level 4) auf den Adults-only-Pool, den tollen Garten und das Meer.- einfach perfekt.
Hotel:
Das Haus hat 2 Flügel mit Zimmern  mit der Lobby in der Mitte. Alles ist elegant und großzügig.
Garten: 
Der Garten (Meerseitig) ist eins der vielen Highlights des Hotetels:
Er ist sehr gepflegt mit einem Adults-only-Pool, dem Lagoon-Pool, einem Kinderpool, einem Wasser-Erlebnis-Bereich, und vielen anderen Aktivitäten. 
Auf der Landseite befindet sich der hauseigene 18-Loch-Golfplatz, traumhaft gepflegt, ein Muß, auch wenn man nicht Golf spielt.
Restaurants:
Buffetrestaurant: Bujunhala:
Das Hauptrestaurant ist recht groß und dadurch nicht ganz gemütlich. Eine Unterteilung mit leichten Stoffen würde hier schon mehr Atmosphäre schaffen. Sehr liebevoll gestalteter Kinderbereich mit eigenem Minis-Buffet.
Hier wird sowohl das Frühstück, was sehr gut ist, als auch das Abendliche Dinner-Buffet serviert. 
Alacarte-Restaurant Sera: gemütliches Restaurant, 
Cocktaillounge Gimanhala: das Gimanhala wurde leider die ersten Tage unseres Aufenthalts umgebaut/renoviert.  Nach Wiedereröffnung durften wir hier den High-Tea geniessen.
Golfclub und Bar Ulpatha:
Ein echtes ""Schmankerl"": direkt am Golfplatz genießt man hier einen Cocktail bei Sonnenuntergang, aber auch tolle moderne Küche. Gegen 16:00 schaut dann auch der ein oder andere Pfau auf der Terrasse vorbei und geht mit den Gästen auf Tuchfühlung.

2. Die ""Software"":
Uns ist wieder die  Freundlichkeit und der Professionalität aller Mitarbeiter aufgefallen.
Herausragend war Navindu im Restaurant Bojunhala, der -trotz teilweise viel Trubel- immer freundlichst und aufmerksam war, wie wir es sonst nur in der Spitzengastronomie gewohnt  sind.
Auch der Koch Dilan hat uns sehr mit seiner tollen Küche verwöhnt.
Im Ulpatha wurden wir speziell vom dortigen Teamleiter mit aussergewöhnlichem Service umsorgt. 
Danke an dieser Stelle, auch an das gesamte Team.","Urlaub im Paradies","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1012405192-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Complex is pretty impressive with several good eating and drinking options, though for Sri Lanka a little on the expensive side but guess what you get in a ""luxury"" resort.

Service generally good though one day at 4:45pm room still not made up so chased that up as we wanted new towels.

Throughout our stay, every member of your staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. The F&B team at your restaurant delighted us each day with an impressive variety of delicious dishes—every meal was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. We especially enjoyed the local specialties, and appreciated how attentive the servers were in recommending new items and accommodating our requests.

Our room was immaculately maintained, with all facilities in perfect working order. The housekeeping staff paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring our space was always pristine and inviting. Equally noteworthy was the spotless condition of the entire resort: the sparkling pool areas, lush gardens, and common areas all reflected your commitment to cleanliness and excellence.

We would also like to extend our gratitude to the management team for regularly checking in on us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Your proactive approach and genuine interest in our comfort did not go unnoticed and made us feel truly valued as guests.

I wish to extend my heartfelt appreciation to both of you for the exceptional support and coordination you provided as Operations Managers in charge of the event. Everything was executed seamlessly and right on time, without any delays. All the last-minute requests and changes that arose during the evening were handled efficiently and with great professionalism.

A special word of thanks also goes to the stewarding staff on duty that evening. Their service was outstanding throughout the event. In particular, the bartender who attended to us that night deserves high praise for the excellent service delivered.

On behalf of the organizing committee, I take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to the entire team – the banquet captain, banquet operations managers, and the stewarding staff – for your contribution in making the evening a memorable success.

Staff is very welcoming and attentive, from the doormen to the front desk, waitstaff, and house keeping, staff is very good. We especially enjoyed Avishka’s (hope I spelled his name right!) service. Such a pleasant person with exceptional service. The front desk staff was very accommodating of our strange scheduled stay, as we spent our first and third week in Sri Lanka at this hotel. We are very grateful for the arrangements they made for us. 

My one gripe is that the one time we really wanted to order indoor dining/room service, as I was not feeling well from a long day of being out. It took a long time for the staff to bring up the QR code for me to even order food, and that’s after I had to call a second time 20ish minutes later to see if they’d brought it. By the time I ordered and was told it would be there in 20 minutes, almost an hour and a half passed, in which I was not really hungry by that point. Other than that, I would certainly stay here again and for an extended stay.","Coming Back!","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1015335960-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The breakfast is served in a lovely modern dining area with views into the garden. The food was ordered from a menu and was delicious.
I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking for a small quiet place away from the noisy centre.
The only slight downside of the particular room we had was that once the window blind was  lifted the room  felt quite open to anyone walking past on the path outside. However that was no big deal.

It was the perfect spot to relax after a fabulous tour around Sri Lanka with On the go tours.
The hotel was built five years ago and is nestled between Palm trees and  lagoons with a wonderful beachfront with wonderful sunsets across the Indian Ocean. Darshi Peiris was our awesome guest services manager who made sure we have a nice front facing junior suite and also recommended a private dining anniversary celebration on the beach. Darshi looped in the sous chef so I was able to plan a bespoke sea food supper and we even saw a hatchling turtle join us at supper on its way down for its first every swim - amazing experience and I wondered if Darshi also waved her magic want to arrange the hatchling?!
The poolside is very well managed and beautifully cleaned by the outdoor team and we enjoyed the Olive pool bar for lunch and drinks.
Restaurant S serves a great breakfast buffet and supper is available a very comprehensive buffet.  We do find the evening buffet too large so preferred a la Carte but some some nights they did not offer it in the S restaurante so we have to eat super at Olive which is limited. The a la carte did have delicious Sri Lankan traditional curries which were loved.
The gym team did early morning Joga and stretch classes and the only suggestion would be take advantage of the wonderful outdoor areas and offer a qualified Yoga Class which we would happily pay for. The beach or roof terraces would be a great setting for sunrise yoga. 
Hats off to darshi for really looking after us and making our stay truly memorable. We look forward to coming back.

I was a part of Rishabh Parakh’s team which was in your hotel from 17th to 21st April 2025. Our entire team was hosted by you and your entire wonderful team at Sheraton Beach Resort Kosgoda.

We had an amazing stay at your resort. The location and the view from the property is just breath-taking. 

The food was simply excellent, very tasty. Breakfast was very lavish. The ambience was absolutely amazing, and it just lifted our spirits. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The room service whenever called, was very prompt, which is what you want actually. 

When I was carrying my colleague’s kid and also had 2 plates of breakfast in hand, seeing that Kalpani came running to carry the plates so I could carry the kid conveniently. It just shows the amount of passion for the profession that she has and the service levels she wants to keep. Not to forget Dilki and Tharumani who used to welcome us at the door of S Kitchen with a bright smile, always willing to help you find the right place to sit for breakfast.
Also Robison came to collect our baggage from our rooms. He was like ever smiling and happy to do his job. This pleasant behavior gives positive vibes and leaves a nice feeling. 

Another incident worth mentioning is that one of our colleagues had misplaced his backpack at the lobby one evening and only realized it the next morning. So after inquiring at the reception, they said they will call back once they have located. But after a couple of hours, we got a little anxious and that time it was Irshaad at the reception, and he overheard our conversation with the reception person. He immediately jumped into the conversation and asked us a few questions, rushed inside and came out with the backpack.   

So all in all we had an amazing experience. The entire team is motivated and enthusiastic to go over and beyond to give that experience to guests. Most definitely this will be our first place of stay when we go next time again.","What an experience !!!!

Нам понравилось что нет шумной анимации, только аква-аэробика ближе к обеду. В обе стороны простирается дикий пляж, очень красиво вокруг, можно много гулять по пляжу. В отеле очень хорошо кормят, приветливый персонал. Если не берёте по системе все включено, то достаточно проблематично покушать где-то поблизости, нужно ехать в Бентоту. Нам понравилось в ресторане beach club, но туда тоже надо ехать на тук-туке.
 Номера в нормальном состоянии. Приветливый персонал. 
Также мы брали экскурсии у местного агента Банду. Очень комфортно довез до сафари и Эллы на новой тойоте королла с кондиционером. Проходили в своем комфортном темпе все достопримечательности. По цене вышло выгоднее чем у туроператоров. Искренне рекомендую, его номер +94 77 783 6537.

We spent a lot of time at the hotel, simply because the view was so beautiful and relaxing. 

We enjoyed a calming Ayurvedic massage in our room, which the hotel kindly arranged through a third party. The manager was also incredibly helpful, organizing a tuk-tuk tour of the ancient city, which allowed us to see many fascinating historical sites. The hotel's location is perfect and right at the heart of these sites 

The food was a nice mix of Asian and Western dishes, all fresh and delicious. The service was exceptional, especially from Arun, who made our stay even more enjoyable. His hospitality was outstanding and his cocktail-making skills are not to be missed! Particularly his Piña Colada! 

The pool and restaurant quickly became our favorite spots to unwind, especially with the wildlife around. I regularly spotted eagles, pelicans, beautiful butterflies, chipmunks and even an occasional toque macaque.

Es erfüllt uns mit großer Freude zu lesen, dass Sie einen so wunderbaren Aufenthalt bei uns im Occidental Eden Beruwala hatten.

Unser engagiertes Team, insbesondere unser geschätzter Barkeeper Shameera und unsere Mitarbeiterin Eashani, haben Ihren Aufenthalt zu etwas ganz Besonderem gemacht.

Die positive Resonanz zu unserem vielfältigen All-Inclusive-Angebot und der reichhaltigen Auswahl an vegetarischen Speisen bestätigt unseren hohen gastronomischen Standard. Die einzigartige Lage unseres Resorts, wo der Bentota-Fluss auf den Indischen Ozean trifft, schafft perfekte Bedingungen für entspannte Momente am Wasser.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience of your recent visit to Occidental Eden Beruwala, A Member Of Barcelo Hotel Group.

Your comments mean a great deal to us, and we value your comprehensive review of your experience.

We extend our sincere apologies for the initial accommodation that did not meet your expectations and the subsequent bathroom maintenance issue. Our maintenance team has addressed these concerns to prevent future occurrences. The beachfront location, while picturesque, does experience natural tidal patterns and currents typical of river mouth areas, and we prioritize guest safety in our recommendations regarding water activities.

We are delighted that our team could promptly resolve the situation by providing you with an upgraded accommodation. The spacious suite with its premium amenities truly represents our commitment to guest comfort. Our culinary team takes great pride in preparing exceptional dishes for both breakfast and dinner service, and we are pleased these exceeded your expectations.

Finally, it brings us joy that you found tranquility by our swimming pool after your extensive travels, and that our attentive staff members delivered the high standard of service we strive to maintain.

We arrived to a warm welcome by the staff. When we were shown to our room, we found it to be slightly dated & it felt like a bit of an anticlimax from what we’d been used to during our trip to Sri Lanka. 

We realised quickly that the bath/shower set up leaked all over the bathroom floor. I raised this with reception & asked to move rooms. We then received an upgrade & the upgraded room was brilliant, it was like a completely different hotel. The staff couldn’t have done any more for us with regards to resolving this issue. 

The upgraded room was spacious & immaculately presented. The food during our evening meals & breakfast was fantastic. 

It was great to wind down & relax around the pool area after 10 days of travelling. 

The beach area was accessible, but the beach is situated on the mouth of a river. Probably not the most hygienic to be swimming in, the sea is notoriously choppy a lot of the time with strong currents from the river so it was sensible not to go any further than a paddle. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our time at Eden. Thank you for a lovely stay.","Lovely hotel, helpful staff.","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r1011278560-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

A heartfelt thank you to Mr.Dewage from F&B, who made sure every dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. At Gimanhala Lounge, Sanura was exceptional behind the bar friendly, professional, and always attentive. Maduranga from in-room dining delivered every order with care, and Akash at the pool added to the laid-back, warm vibe with his cheerful service.

A special mention to Kalindu from the service center, who assisted me via WhatsApp always quick, kind, and efficient in answering all my requests. It made a real difference in the comfort of my stay.

Everyone I came across was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere at Shangri-La Hambantota is something special calming, warm, and full of genuine smiles. It was the perfect escape, and I left feeling completely refreshed.

The hotel staff is truly exceptional - their professional and warm attitude makes the stay special and enjoyable. 
The surroundings are like a real paradise, where nature with beautiful peacocks in the garden and jumping monkeys all around, but at the same time creating a peaceful and delightful atmosphere. 
The food is not only delicious, but also versatile, satisfying even the most demanding gourmets. 
The clean and warm pools provide complete relaxation, allowing you to feel a true sense of relaxation and enjoy every moment. 
A great place for children, where they have been thought of! 
This experience is so impressive that we definitely want to return with our family and immerse ourselves in this oasis again, where every element - from the hospitality and the surrounding landscape to the food and the relaxing atmosphere - indicates the highest quality service.

We also dined at a couple of the hotel’s restaurants and enjoyed everything we tried. The Churros Café was especially fun—we had some cake and samosas there, and both were fresh and tasty.

Beyond the food, the room itself was very comfortable. The bed was super cozy and the pillows were great too—just the right amount of support. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained, which made the whole stay feel relaxing and easy.

As I always travel alone for business I also enjoyed my daily chat with Chaminda who was always keen to see how things were going. 

Sampath went so far as to attend meetings (at my invitation) with me so that he could translate when required and had then provided an invaluable follow up service. 

If I could package the caring nature and service of these two, I’d package it up and recommend it to business customers. 

Whilst the Taj in Bentota was a more modern and better appointed hotel, the service at both properties was truly memorable.","Truly memorable business product sourcing trip","2025-05","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1013571424-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The birthday cake was really kind too, and very unexpected! We were travelling with a few friends, and all of us felt well taken care of. It’s rare to see such consistently warm service across the board, so please do pass on our thanks to the wider team as well.We especially enjoyed our dinner at Yumi — amazing food and a great atmosphere.

There was a small glitch with the booking, but it got sorted quickly and didn’t affect the rest of the trip.

What stood out was how kind and attentive everyone was, without it ever feeling forced. From the check-in to little things like a note in the room and a birthday cake the gestures really stayed with us.

The hotel itself is lovely, but it was the people who made it feel relaxed and welcoming. My friends felt the same. We all left talking about how well we were looked after.

Also, Yumi totally lived up to the hype. The food was spot on and the staff made sure we were well looked after.

Left with good memories. Would happily come back.","Great stay and experience at the Taj","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1013255727-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

So, when I came to Sri Lanka on vacation, I was happy to stay at this hotel during the days I planned to spend in Colombo. The rooms are very nice and clean, and have everything you need. The hotel is located centrally in Colombo and has easy access to all major destinations which is a huge benefit. 

Over a period of 3 weeks, I stayed at the hotel for about 7 nights as I was travelling away from Colombo frequently. The staff was friendly and supportive. Niroshan and Rushani from the front desk were especially very helpful in my encounters with them. I thank them for their kind hospitality. Secondly, the food in the restaurant is also some of the best food I've had. Definitely recommend the room service here. 

One of the only things that I could suggest as an improvement is to have larger water bottles in the room. We ran out of the bottles quite regularly and had to call up housekeeping to refill them multiple times (to which they happily obliged, which is great!) 

All in all, ME Colombo is definitely good value for money. You also get access to a rooftop infinity pool and a bar. I was able to host a couple of my friends at the rooftop bar for a nice cold beer as well. P.S. The view of the Colombo skyline from the rooftop is amazing. You can also get this view with most of their Superior rooms. 

By this point, I was starting to feel like it was home. However, I tried checking in for another time (8th night in 3 weeks if my memory is accurate) but did not have the best experience. Maybe it's my fault that I didn't make a reservation. My plans are always so sudden, so I couldn't manage to book anything before. Regardless, when I arrived at the hotel to try and check in, I was given very conflicting information and potentially treated unfairly. I arrived a little earlier than the check-in time. The receptionist at the time communicated to me that I could get a room a little later once some of the guests check out and the rooms are cleaned. I was happy to wait and even offered my card to finalise the payment. She even said that she will try to get the room arranged for me sooner for an early check-in. At that point, she had to contact the manager to get the authorisation for a special rate that was offered to me since I was planning to come back multiple times during my 6-week stay in Sri Lanka. The manager then came in and checked some things, and suddenly told me that there is no availability. Was it because he didn't want to oblige to the rate I had before when the hotel had low occupancy and it was at high occupancy at the time? Or was it because I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt with flip flops because I drove all the way from Kandy? Or maybe it was a miscommunication and a misunderstanding. Regardless, it didn't feel right to us. Ultimately, we ended up going to a different hotel that we quite enjoyed","Great place and a very enjoyable stay.

A special thank you goes out to Mr. Rilwan, the Front Office Manager, for leading such a fantastic team. Every interaction with Aruna, Sithumini, Rushani, and our all-time favorite Niroshan is a pleasure — they consistently go above and beyond to check in on us and make our stay memorable.

Also, a huge shoutout to Gopi from housekeeping, who always adds that extra special touch to our room, and Suraj from the restaurant, who never fails to serve up amazing cocktails with a smile.

This five-star establishment is truly remarkable, offering breathtaking views of the sea based on my observations. The resort is blessed with an eco-friendly environment and boasts a stunning beachfront surrounded by lush greenery, alongside the awe-inspiring sight of the beautiful sea and a hillside monastery that we enjoyed during our stay at Eden. 
The hotel lobby is impressive, spacious, and impeccably clean, presented in a highly attractive manner. The young team at the front office works diligently, and we must commend them for their professionalism, attention to detail, and willingness to assist at any time. We received a wonderfully warm welcome from the hotel staff, who ensured our comfort throughout our stay from the very first day at this lovely establishment. The treatment we received from the hotel team was exceptional, and the rooms assigned to us exceeded our expectations; they were beautifully presented, spotless, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. My partner required extra care during this trip, and the hotel team consistently ensured she felt happy and comfortable, helping even before we asked for it. In my personal experience, the resort team is truly a **GEM**. 
Thank you, Rohan, Yohan, and your exceptional team—an incredible group of individuals, professional in their roles and attentive to detail, always humble and kind. The remarkable aspect of this team is their ability to remember guest preferences, making it impressive to witness how they care for their guests at Eden; it is truly an extraordinary experience. 
The fantastic food and beverage team at the hotel acts and thinks in alignment with their operational leaders, demonstrating excellent training; they are incredibly friendly, professional in their service, polite, and always willing to help. The housekeeping team maintained our rooms in pristine condition and ensured the hotel lobby area was well-kept and spotless. The main restaurant, Garden of Eden/Sippi, a new dining venue, offers an outstanding selection of high-quality meals. We enjoyed Sri Lankan Lamp Rice at Sippi on our first night, which was delightful with generous portions; the food spread at the main restaurant during our repeated stay was consistently delicious. 
The dining area boasts a great atmosphere, with a positive vibe evident during meal times. The food is exceptional and served in a hygienic manner to all guests. I must emphasise that excellent vegetarian options were available for guests. The restaurant service was extraordinary, with staff members exhibiting exceptional attention to detail, all of whom were friendly and polite at all times. Once again, thank you to GM Rohan, his fantastic team Yohan, the wonderful front office staff, Suresh, and his charming food and beverage team, Chef Deepal, Viraj, and his terrific team of chefs, who treated us with kindness and politeness. 
The hotel staff were highly professional, caring, and attentive to detail at all times.

vielen Dank für Ihren Besuch und Ihre Rückmeldung.

Es erfüllt uns mit Freude, dass Sie erneut eine großartige Zeit in unserem Occidental Eden Beruwala erlebt haben.

Dennoch bedauern wir, dass unser Angebot am Nachmittag nicht ganz Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat und nehmen Ihre Anregung für Kaffee und Kuchen gerne auf. Zudem verstehen wir, dass die Eignung unseres Hotels für Familien mit Kindern subjektiv variieren kann und wir respektieren Ihre Meinung hierzu.

Wir freuen uns sehr, dass Sie die Großzügigkeit und Sauberkeit unserer Zimmer sowie den freundlichen und zuvorkommenden Service unseres Zimmerservicepersonals schätzen. Dass Reparaturen schnell und effizient durchgeführt werden, ist ein wichtiger Teil unseres Services, und wir sind stolz darauf, dass dies von Ihnen positiv hervorgehoben wurde. Ihr Lob an Mr. Lasantha vom Housekeeping wissen wir zu schätzen und werden es gerne weiterleiten.

Abschließend möchten wir Ihnen für die Anerkennung der Qualität unseres Essens und die positive Rückmeldung zu unseren Restaurant- und Barmitarbeitern danken. Das Wohl unserer Gäste liegt uns am Herzen und das regelmäßige Nachfragen, ob alles zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit ist, gehört zu unserem Standard. Die Empfehlung unserer All-Inclusive-Option freut uns besonders, da wir stets bestrebt sind, unseren Gästen ein hervorragendes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu bieten.

Wir möchten Ihnen nochmals unseren Dank für diesen liebenswürdigen Bericht über unser Hotel aussprechen und freuen uns, Sie in Zukunft wieder bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen.

An dieser Stelle möchten wir uns besonders bei Mr. Lasantha vom Housekeeping für seinen engagierten Einsatz bedanken.

Das Essen ist gut, allerdings wäre es wünschenswert, am Nachmittag zusätzlich Kaffee und ein Stück Kuchen angeboten zu bekommen.
Der Restaurantkapitän Mr. Nuwan, Herr Tharusha Dilshan aus der Küche sowie Mr. Sangeeth (F&B Manager) erkundigten sich regelmäßig, ob alles zu unserer Zufriedenheit sei.

Auch die Poolbar ist hervorragend – das Personal dort ist ebenso stets freundlich und aufmerksam.

The only drawback is that the swimming pool is right next to the restaurant, so guests dining there can see you while you’re in the pool, which compromises privacy a bit. There’s easy access to the beach as well, but again, not much privacy there either, which I personally didn’t like.

As soon as I entered, the staff was very warm, welcoming, and attentive such that I have felt special during my stay.

The location is perfect, right across the ocean with breathtaking views and conveniently close to key landmarks in Colombo.

The hospitality was excellent. As soon as we entered, we were greeted by the friendly staff with  smiles and typical Sri Lankan hospitality.
Special thanks and shout out to  to Ms. Thamali Wijesiri and Mr. Samrat Datta who ensured every detail of my stay was perfect and fabulous. We are grateful  to them for  going above and beyond to make our experience so memorable and unforgettable.

  My room was very large with all the amenities and was as clean as could be with a lovely Balcony overlooking the sea which made mornings even more special. The bed was very comfortable and the room service was quick and efficient.
The pool surroundings were calm and well kept and provided an oasis of tranquility in the city. I also liked the green gardens and the feeling of serenity that the premises gives although located in a busy area of Colombo.

I really liked the buffet breakfast and Dinner at POC, a huge variety of local and international dishes.One of the greatest highlight of our stay was the fact that there was Indian vegetarian food available. As vegetarians, we felt quite pleased to get the original and tasty Indian food . A big  thanks to Chef Nair and Chef Anuj. I cannot fail to mention names of Ruwan and Dasum who served not only efficiently but also with a smile which was very impressive.

One can hardly find this kind of commitment and elegance in service, and the staff of Taj actually embodies the gist of Indian and Sri Lankan hospitality.

On the whole, Taj Samudra combines classic style and the service of the international level. I would definitely recommend  it to other business as well as leisure travelers.","A Holiday we will always remember","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1012542193-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

Amar,Nisal, Sanjeewa and Michael were all wonderful and we so looked forward to coming back home to the club lounge to our tea coffee and hot chocolate. Great to print stuff and use the boardrooms for meetings. The housekeeping staff were great too rooms  kept very clean, and a special shout out to Dhanushka. The reception staff were also so helpful and a special thankyou to Anjalee and Mr Dhuruv. If we had any issues and we only had one on the first night staff were very quick to sort it. The issue was if staying on the 7th floor there was a lot of noise from the music from weddings  above but as soon as we were moved to the 6th floor we had no issues. Feel better soundproofing is required unless a wedding guest. Overall a wonderful experience fantastic staff and made to feel at home. Highly reccomend the Taj club rooms in particular.

I travelled here with my husband, friend and her little boy. I speak both English and Sinhala, so it was very nice to chat away in both to them. My husband who doesn't speak Sinhalese felt very welcome here and they didn't just use me as a translator as they did in some places but spoke in English with him. The food was excellent with generous portions. The Sri Lankan food was devoid of pretention and tasted like good, home cooked food. The pool was excellent, shallow but deep enough to enjoy a nice swim. My friend's little boy is a little unruly at times and they spoke to him really kindly and treated him well, even playing Caram with him one time. They had 3 little cats who were very cute and friendly. The rooms were beautiful - we had the upper apartment and my husband and I had the bigger room with the four-poster bed which was beautiful and very comfortable.

Chanuka was pretty much running the whole place and did an amazing job.  He was our bellman, our concierge, our waiter, our barista, and even pointed out a few cool birds/animals to us that we would have otherwise missed out on.  There was no task he couldn’t help out with!  Everything we ordered from the restaurant was great as well.  The Chicken Kuttu was my favorite and I had it every day.

The swimming pool was clean and it was a nice to be able to spend some time relaxing after the safari etc.
The staff seemed genuinely nice, friendly and always ready to help if needed. Chanukah at the reception was especially nice - during our first dinner he called us to come hear & then  see an owl that happened to be at the property. Small thing but it showed passion for nature and going extra mile for us guests.
The restaurant of the hotel is nice - they ask you to order in advance as the chef cooks everything right there & needs to calculate the time needed.
I also recommend going for safari and visiting other sites of Udawalawe with the hotel driver Lassa who was great!
Definitely recommend this hotel and would happily return there myself!","Great place, very happy with our choice","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d13804085-r990284097-Jungle_Paradise-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The villas are in need of some maintainance where the tropical weather & termites have been at work, but final mention to the Gardeners who keep the extensive gardens in perfect balance for visual beauty but nature friendliness...birds galore, lizards, even some (non-venomous) snakes & daily visits from the mongooses!

A special mention to Darsha, Ajantha, and Shanaka, whose service was truly remarkable. They consistently went above and beyond to meet my needs, always attentive, courteous, and professional. Their willingness to go the extra mile did not go unnoticed — whether it was assisting with special requests, providing helpful recommendations, or ensuring that every meal and interaction was perfect, they exceeded all expectations.

The attention to detail, prompt service, and genuine care they demonstrated made my experience unforgettable. It’s rare to find staff who are so dedicated to ensuring guests have the best possible stay. I am truly grateful for their efforts and cannot recommend this hotel enough, thanks to these incredible team members.

The complex is very clean and well maintained. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. We had a lot of laughs with the staff.

We rented the deluxe flat with two bedrooms. The whole furnishing (beautiful wooden furniture, comfortable sofas) is very typical for the country and we liked it very much. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom clean (a bit less water pressure in the shower, but we know that from India and Sri Lanka, we took it with humour).

We had dinner at the resort: a typical curry, which was very tasty.
The breakfast was rich: a plate with fresh fruit, a papaya juice, pankecake with sweet coconut mixture and an omelette.

We also organised the safari through Jungel Paradise. We left at 6am and saw all kinds of animals: Elephants, crocodiles, eagles, jackals, chameleon, iguana â€¦for our son an insane experience.

We found it very nice that Jungle Paradise is located in the middle of wild nature. We heard many animals and everything was very green.

We thank the whole Jungle Paradise team for this great stay and the unforgettable experiences.","Safari feeling in the middle of wild nature, very well maintained and clean","2023-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3577009-d13804085-r905439890-Jungle_Paradise-Udawalawa_Sabaragamuwa_Province.html",

The resort provided a perfect setting for our three-day conference, held in their spacious ballroom. The facilities were well-equipped, with tea and coffee available during the sessions, which was a thoughtful touch. The big garden and the serene environment added to the overall calmness, allowing us to focus during our sessions.

The rooms were comfortable and clean, with fresh linens and all necessary amenities, ensuring a pleasant stay for everyone. The meals were delicious, and the variety of options offered kept everyone satisfied.

A special thanks to Mr. Tennakoon, the F&B Executive, whose exceptional support and coordination made our conference seamless. The staff, in general, were incredibly friendly, helpful, and accommodating, which added to our positive experience.

Overall, the resort’s calm atmosphere, excellent facilities, and attentive staff made it an ideal venue for our conference.

My next stop was the serene and secluded Calamansi Cove Villas—a hidden gem along Sri Lanka’s southwestern coast, where relaxation is as much a part of the experience as the view itself.

Tucked away in lush tropical gardens and framed by crashing waves, Calamansi Cove felt like a sanctuary. The resort has an intimate, boutique feel, with just a handful of private villas thoughtfully spaced for privacy and tranquillity. The moment I arrived, I could feel my shoulders drop and my breath deepen. This was the Sri Lankan coastline at its most calming—no rush, no noise, just the sound of the ocean and the rustle of palm leaves overhead.

My accessible villa was conveniently located on the ground floor, with level access throughout. The open-plan design made it easy to navigate, and the staff had already anticipated my needs, offering small but thoughtful touches to make my stay more comfortable. Wide doorways, smooth paths, and a gentle slope into the villa made independent movement easy, and the privacy of my own little courtyard added an extra layer of peace.

The grounds themselves were a joy to explore. Meandering garden paths led through thickets of tropical flowers, overhanging vines, and the occasional splash of colour from native birds flitting between trees. I found quiet corners to sit and read, sip tea, or simply listen to the rhythm of the waves crashing onto the beach beyond the palms.

There was no itinerary here—just time. Time to breathe. Time to reflect. Time to let the vibrant pace of the trip so far settle into something slower and softer.

Calamansi Cove was a gentle reminder that travel, especially as a wheelchair user, doesn’t always have to be a high-adrenaline adventure. Sometimes, it’s about finding places where nature and comfort hold equal space—and giving yourself permission to rest within them.","A hidden Gem - Time to relax and unwind","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r1012517766-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

It’s truly a place that feels like home — but on vacation.

The biggest highlight for us is the exceptional service. The people who work here are incredibly kind and warm. It’s such a joy to return and see familiar faces who not only remember us, but also know and genuinely care about our children. That kind of connection is rare and deeply meaningful.

We want to give special thanks to Sujith, Nerodha, Shalini and Jayavira, who have looked after us and our children every single time we’ve visited. Their care and attention make all the difference, and we are so grateful for their presence.

This is a perfect place for curious little explorers — our kids loved collecting coconuts, spotting iguanas and monkeys, watching hermit crabs, searching for shells, and exploring the plants and flowers. The surroundings are simply beautiful: peaceful, private, and just steps away from a quiet beach.

We’re already planning our next trip with the whole family, even if it means traveling for 24 hours with two kids — it’s always worth it for the rest, nature, and warmth we experience at Calamansi Cove.

Also, a special shoutout to Asela for the unforgettable massage — truly a highlight of the stay!

I fell in love with the place, the food, the people who work there.  So this year I booked eight nights - and I could have easily been happy to stay another eight or eighteen even.  The staff, from Nirodha's expert concierge skills and kindness, to Sujit's attentive lifeguarding (and good company), to the housekeeping guys Sadeep, Harindu, Tharindu, to waiting staff including Harati, to the gardeners and handymen, to the gatekeeper who lets you know when your tuk tuk has arrived - it's a team that works together like a happy family.  And to top all of that, I had superb dinner company from one of the owners, Eveline - who generously gave me information about the local area and what it's like to live in Sri Lanka.  I stayed in the Calamansi Suite (above the restaurant) which is unbelievably spacious and serene.  The food here is worth a separate review of its own - once again I loved the grilled Jack fish dinner, the seafood mango/avo salad, the beet root, watermelon and feta salad, and perfectly fresh breakfast with just enough but not too much of what you want.  Love the chili-accented coconut ice cream.   I swam in the ocean every chance I could get - sometimes three times a day.  I really think Balapitiya has some of the very best swimming beaches in Sri Lanka (not that I have sampled them all - but can't imagine better).   I also fell for the small town and recommend walking along its main road to visit the shops - especially the Citizen Salon for a good haircut and truly great face and head massage!  I truly love this place and these people.  I can't think of a single other hotel in my travel experience that has me weeping when it's time to leave.","Happy Return","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r1000810349-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

The villa we had (Mango) was beautiful with a private garden area to relax and listen to the tropical sounds around.
Everywhere was spotlessly clean around the resort.
Lovely meals in the restaurant….some have mentioned slow service…we have waited longer in restaurants in the U.K….Whats the rush anyway when you can sit and enjoy a cold beer and delight in the beautiful surroundings. ( maybe some soft music would add a nice ambiance)
Stunning beach on your doorstep and fun watching the fishermen taking their boats out ( from 5pm ish) daily and also pulling in their catch with the nets.
The pool was great to cool off and must mention the lifeguard who we loved chatting to and explained lots about the nature of the area.
Also Asela who gives the most wonderful massages while listening to the sound of the ocean.
But a shout out to all the staff from the gardeners to the receptionist..Nirodha who,s communication is exceptional..Thank you.

We stayed here for only one day/night and it was raining most of the time. We had our own car, hence it was convenient to go out otherwise we would be stuck here because of the rain. 

Our garden villa(named Rambutan) was nice and spacious. It is set in a tropical forest with a huge outdoor area and rooftop terrace. But mosquitoes wouldn't let us sit outside. The problem with our villa was that other guests could look into our room when they were passing by. So we had to keep the curtains down. I wouldn't recommend this villa.
The food at the restaurant was alright but expensive. The service was pretty slow. For dinner, one has to confirm hours before and for breakfast one has to order the night before.
The pool was good and the beach was excellent. There is a fishing village right next door.  Pretty idyllic!

We stayed in a lovely villa and enjoyed some really excellent food.  I can really recommend their water melon, beetroot, cucumber & feta salad and their amazing fresh fish curry.
It's a fantastic, peaceful place to unwind for a couple of days before the trip back to Colombo. Their lovely team prepared a great breakfast, in a box, for us to take with us on our trip back to the airport, given our early start. 
The pool is lovely, but the real star of the show is the magnificent white sandy beach and the great sunsets which we enjoyed before dinner.","A Delightful Hidden Gem","2024-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r946534447-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

 A special thank you to Dahan at the lobby area — he was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

Serenath and his team go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay.

The rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and well appointed.

The large bath with a view out to the ocean is amazing!

The housekeeping team make sure your room is immaculate.

The reception staff very welcoming, friendly and helpful.

The waiting and kitchen staff are very efficient, friendly and make sure that your food is just right for you and are happy to deal with any special requests.

The food was exceptional and the fruit juices were worth the wait for them to be prepared from ripe fresh fruit. The Thambili and passion fruit juices are highly recommended.

The treacle tour experience is excellent and thoroughly recommended if you want a culinary experience of real local life.

It’s an excellent stop-off between Ella and the coast - roughly 2 hours/100km. This hotel is set in a stunning location with beautiful trees and flowers that have been well tended; we lay by the pool listening to peacocks and toucans calling. Namal and his team were delightful and went out of their way to make sure we were happy. We had a lovely welcome drink on arrival and they made us tea for 5.45 with the offer of a packed breakfast before our elephant safari. Our room was clean, spacious, and with a lovely private balcony/verandah, which would have been lovely to have spent more time on if it allowed. The swimming pool was an added bonus which we used several times during our short stay - Namal very kindly allowed us to use it in the evening after dinner as we’d arrived late from Ella. From here, you are a 10 minute drive to the National Park, which is a must. You are even closer to the elephant transite site (orphanage), which we didn’t go to but wish we had in hindsight. It has a decent reputation of being ethical and you can bottle fed babies at 10.30 and 2.30 (we were heading to the coast at midday so couldn’t do the later, and had thought the first slot would be too tight - but actually the elephant safari was 6.30-9.30 and is just a little down the road).

On the drive back to the hotel we passed some sugar canes and the safari driver, of his own accord, hacked a small one down for us. The hotel chopped this into edible pieces and showed us how to eat natural sugar cane for dessert, which was was unique and delicious. We ordered the sri lankan curry for dinner, which was a very tasty meal, and the fruit and omlette for breakfast was simple but tasted ok. The communal eating area is less bug-free than the rooms, but this is because it is partly outside, and generally we are talking mainly flies, beetles, gheckos (and some sweet cats).

We have had two rooms for 2 days in the main building.
The rooms are clean and big, equipped with a good shower and a balcony to enjoy the pool side view.
The breakfast is very delicious and every morning they are serving a different kind of Sri Lankan style breakfast as a side dish. Perfect to explore the Sri Lankan cuisine.
The pool is the right place to relax after an exhausting day.
Very friendly staff and very good service !!!!
I would stay there next time again....

Beautiful unique scenery and peaceful surroundings within the confines of a local village. Extremely clean and comfortable room with a lot of extra space and air conditioned comfort. Large comfortable bed and good amenities. The general manager Mr Ranjith Kumara and his staff could not do enough to ensure my safety and comfort, going out of their way to please. I loved every minute of my 6 day stay and would recommend again and again. I hope to come back. From the base of this wonderful hotel I saw and experienced many unique things that I never expected to see from a home cooking demo strand lunch in a local home to elephants and monkeys.

Уютный маленький оазис на самом берегу океана. Очень дружелюбный и отзывчивый персонал! Готовы решить любую проблему, любой вопрос. 
Отель удобно расположен - рядом магазинчики, банки, кафе. Мы брали только завтраки. Кухня адаптирована под европейского туриста: делают омлет или глазунью на ваш выбор. Специи, добавки - по желанию. Очень вкусный хлеб. Выпечка тоже - пончики, круассаны и прочее. Из фруктов - ананас, бананы, папайя. Утром натуральные соки двух видов. Очень понравился манговый.
Рынки (рыбный и фрукты-овощи в 10 мин. ходьбы). Мы были только один раз - купили манго, съели с удовольствием.
Вечером, лёжа в бассейне, можно смотреть заход солнца. Полный релакс.
У отеля своеобразная пляжная линия, её нет. Есть ступеньки, дальше по двум плитам - и ты в океане. В отлив купаться напротив отеля - одно удовольствие! 
Рядом черепаший пляж, и в другой стороне пляж с рыбками. Риф там совсем рядом с берегом. Мы наснимали много интересных кадров. Отель однозначно всем рекомендую!

Единственный минус это уборка в номерах (даже при почти ежедневных чаевых). Подметают пол и заправляют кровать, а как же пыль на столах и шкафах и насекомые в ванной тоже бы как то обрабатывать. 
В номере 2 больших стола, занимают место, думаю один из них лишний, лучше шкаф для вещей поставить или добавить 1 кровать при необходимости разместить семью 2+2.

Приехали в отель около 13:00, попросили подождать. Мы оставили чемоданы и сходили на обед, благо ресторанов вокруг много.
Заселили нас с детьми в два номера рядом, дверь в дверь, очень было удобно, кровать большую у детей в комнате раздвинули на две сразу после запроса.
Уборка проходила каждый день, убирали чисто, а если шоколадку или чаевые оставите, то еще и полотенца закрутят. Вообще персонал очень отзывчивый, и на рецепшене, и те кто убирали, и в ресторане, всегда улыбчивые, здороваются, желают доброго дня. Мы с мужем в последние дни заболели, нам из ресторана еду приносили в номер. Если непонятно, то общались через переводчик в телефоне. А какие боксы с завтраком собирают, если на экскурсию рано выезжать, там столько всего, что еще и на обед останется перекусить.
Завтраки понравились, выпечка вкусная, лапша, карри, яйца жарят глазунью и омлет, фрукты несколько видов, и мы с мужем, и дети всегда наедались. Кофе не очень понравился, пили чай вместо него.
Номер был с видом на море, шумно, но очень красиво! У детей был номер стандарт (на дорогу), он чуть побольше нашего делюкса, шум с дороги детей не беспокоил.
Новогодний ужин был включен в тур, понравился, очень вкусно было и очень разнообразно! Повара - молодцы!
Хотели при заезде взять еще ужины, но сразу забыли, а потом уже не стали. Хотя пери��дически обедали в ресторане  нашего отеля, всегда было очень вкусно и даже дешевле, чем в ресторанах в округе.
Расположение понравилось, много магазинчиков и кафе рядом, можно купаться прям перед отелем, волны не сильные, налево - пляж с черепахами, прям за ним дальше с берега можно походить по камням (только в коралках, там ежей много), там среди камней мурены, крылатки, акулу рифовую видели и другие рыбки; налево если по пляжу пойти от отеля, то там тоже есть риф с рыбками, можно с маской поплавать и посмотреть, там же и искупаться можно, вода поспокойнее.
Очень понравилось в отеле, чистенько, по домашнему, персонал очень хороший! 
Спасибо вам! С удовольствием вернемся в этот отель!","Семьей в декабре-январе","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r990040383-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Location is a bit out of the way since it's 15-20 mins drive to nuwaraeliya, but if you've got a car and driver and want a quieter location it's fine.

Perhaps management could ask the staff to be quieter in the hallways at night time.

Thank you for your beautifully written review and for choosing to stay with us at Jetwing Lighthouse. We’re truly delighted to hear that your experience was both memorable and meaningful.

It’s wonderful to know that you appreciated the architectural elegance of the hotel, the sustainability efforts we’re so proud of, and the little touches like the king coconut welcome. Your description of the sea view room and the full moon atmosphere was absolutely poetic; we’re so pleased it offered you the sense of serenity you were seeking.

We’re also glad to hear that our unique dual-pool setup made a lasting impression, especially the lap pool by the waves. It’s rare feedback like this that reminds us how special the natural surroundings here truly are.

Thank you again for your kind words about our team, the dining experiences, and the overall ambiance. We look forward to welcoming you back for an even longer and more relaxing stay in the near future.

Ayubowan! (May you live long)

The welcome with king coconut water was a refreshing touch after arrival. The rooms are spacious, well-furnished, and equipped with excellent amenities. Its commitment to sustainability is impressive—arguably one of the best I've seen.

I stayed in a sea view room, which was fantastic. It was just after the full moon—clouds moved across the sky, occasionally letting moonlight shine through. The atmosphere was serene, and I deeply enjoyed the solitude.

There are two swimming pools: one ideal for families, and another 25-meter lap pool that I especially appreciated—something I’ve rarely seen in hotels. Swimming there while listening to the crashing waves and watching them break into white foam was a unique experience.

The staff were warm and professional. Dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and very well arranged, offering a wide variety.

From the moment we arrived, we were met with genuine warmth, attention to detail, and an atmosphere that perfectly blends luxury with the heart of Sri Lankan hospitality.

We were graciously welcomed by Umesha, whose kind and professional demeanor set the tone for the rest of our stay. She also hosted our afternoon tea, a serene experience overlooking the ocean with a lovely selection of teas, pastries, and savory treats. Her thoughtful care made the moment feel truly special.

Dining was consistently excellent across all three restaurants. Under the steady leadership of Awilse, every meal was served with precision, warmth, and attention to detail. The food was incredible—beautifully presented and rich in flavor.

Our children had an amazing time thanks to Imasha and Arushana, who organized creative activities like seashell jewelry making, stick figurines from coconut palm leaves, and a fun ice cream treat. They made our kids feel welcome, valued, and entertained throughout the stay.

The pool experience was another highlight, especially with Buddhika ensuring everything was clean, safe, and comfortable. The fact that the pool is filled with fresh, pure water from on-site wells was impressive—it made swimming feel even more refreshing. At the pool bar, Nimesh and Danidu stood out with their friendly and attentive service. Always serving with a smile, they made sure our family had everything we needed while relaxing poolside.

My wife also enjoyed a phenomenal spa treatment, which she described as peaceful and deeply rejuvenating.

Each night, we returned to a perfectly prepared room thanks to the daily turndown service—a small but impactful luxury that added to the overall comfort of our stay.

One of the standout experiences was the complimentary tuk tuk tour to Jetwing Kurulubedda, their sister property nestled in the jungle. The serene surroundings and breathtaking views of the six villas made for an unforgettable afternoon. We were served a unique and refreshing mangrove apple drink, crafted onsite and unlike anything we’ve tasted before.

Thanks to Imasha’s recommendation, we also enjoyed a guided tour of Galle Fort—organized entirely by the hotel. From the transport to the knowledgeable guide, it was the perfect way to experience the fort’s rich history without any hassle.

Adding a cultural touch to our stay was the traditional Kandyan dance performance hosted one evening at the hotel. It was a vibrant and captivating experience that brought Sri Lankan tradition to life right on the property.

One final note that truly impressed us was how well-maintained the resort is. We regularly observed quiet upkeep and repairs happening throughout the property—especially important for a beachfront hotel. It showed us how much care and pride the team takes in preserving the beauty and quality of Jetwing Lighthouse.

This resort is more than a destination—it’s a complete experience. Every team member, from the front desk to the bar staff, went out of their way to make our family feel at home. We left with full hearts, cherished memories, and an eagerness to return.

If you’re visiting Galle, do not miss the opportunity to stay at Jetwing Lighthouse. It is, without a doubt, a gem of Sri Lanka.","Jetwing Lighthouse – A Thoughtfully Curated, Unforgettable Stay for the Whole Family","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1011838190-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the stunning architecture and the breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. Designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa, the hotel's aesthetic blends modern luxury with Sri Lankan heritage, creating a peaceful and elegant atmosphere.
The staff was incredibly warm and attentive, Jayan , Nimasha, Dhananjani and the rest of the staff were always ready with a smile and happy to assist with any request. The dining options were excellent, offering a mix of local flavors and international cuisine, and the seafood was especially fresh and flavorful.
Jetwing Lighthouse is a perfect blend of comfort, culture, and coastal beauty. I highly recommend it for couples, families, or anyone looking to unwind in style in southern Sri Lanka.","Unforgettable Stay at Jetwing Lighthouse","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1009226333-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I was daydreaming about ways to return for a longer stay even before I had completed my first four days.  And I'm still determined to return.   Like so many of the reviews say - it is located on a perfect swimming beach that often feels private.  But some reviews don't mention how the beach also hosts its own culture of night fishermen and their boats and sometimes day fishing families with their huge nets.  Calamansi Cove is a beautifully  gardened property with paths that yield delightful surprises with each turn.   I loved the serenity of my indoor/outdoor villa, with its roof terrace and white Frangipani tree, its outdoor seating and fan, the gorgeous skylit shower.  I was visited by many birds, frogs, and even a friendly mongoose one morning.  The food is outstanding.  I highly recommend having the very fresh and very local ""Jack Fish,"" at least once while you're here!  If you're lucky, you might have Chandana's expert attentions to guide you through the possibilities.

I think the magic of the place is made by the people there.  Many of them are named in other reviews.  The first and maybe last person you'll encounter is Nirodha, who was a huge help to me, and so warmly welcoming, easy to talk to.  The lifeguard, whose name I've misplaced (I'm sorry brother!), was daily good company and helpful in telling me how the weather and water would be each day.  The gardeners and the handymen were always friendly and seemed to have many interesting projects each day.  The gatekeepers pay attention and the housekeepers and the restaurant staff clearly care for detail. The masseur and the yoga instructor are both frank and supportive.   All are as warm and skilled as I've encountered anywhere in my many years of travelling.  It's not just creative professionlism - they have together a family sensibility, and after having good conversation with the completely charming owners, I can see why.  There's something very special and very sincere about this place.   It has all the balances right.","Sincerity, Beauty, Magic","2024-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r941474563-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

Thankyou for your return visit - and very glad you enjoyed it as much as your last - and looking forward to making it much the same on your next!

Yes indeed - we are no longer associated with Jetwing. We are the same owners, but we have decided to manage the property ourselves. 

All our staff and team have stayed with us  - which is why you continued to appreciate the good service I believe...and the ability to provide our guests even better value for money is a bonus!

Thankyou for your lovely comments and very much looking forward to seeing you again next year.

Начну с того, что решили лететь на Шри-Ланку внезапно, у меня оказалось 2 недели свободного времени, поэтому быстро собрали чемоданы с супругой и на следующий день уже вылетели. Так как практически все отели были забиты под завязку и бронь нигде не подтверждали, выбирали из мгновенного подтверждения. Из 6 отелей выбрали Calamansi и не прогадали, хотя отзывы были неоднозначные, но в целом большинство отзывов хорошие и по фото нам зашел отель. Мы изначально хотели именно бутиковый небольшой отель, так как в таких отелях бывали не один раз и все было отлично! 
Летели Air Arabia со стыковкой в 50 минут в Шардже. Перелет хороший, обслуживание на самолетах приемлемое, только питание платное. Либо запасайтесь едой заранее, либо можно заказать при регистрации на рейс из меню. Можно и в самолете купить по меню за $. В общем прилетели мы в 4-30 утра, быстро прошли паспортный контроль и в 5-30 уже ехали в отель (трансфер заказывали индивидуальный 200$ в Москве) Добрались в 7 утра до отеля и просто обалдели от фантастических видов!!!
Нам сказали подождать с заселением пару часов и предложили позавтракать и посмотреть бухту рядом с отелем. Завтрак был бомбический, в течении часа подача еды, сначала кофе или чай, потом фруктовая тарелка, следом йогрут с фруктами, далее сыр и булочки, после, омлет с беконом, куриной котлетой, зеленью и овощами!  И после десерт из блинчиков с бананами и шоколадным соусом. В общем мы еле вылезли из-за стола!!! И так было каждый день с возможным дополнением в меню, о котором у тебя официант спрашивает на кануне вечером. Огромный респект официанту Шандоме, он весь наш отпуск следил, чтобы мы не были голодными и любые заказы, и наши пожелания в еде исполнялись быстро и точно!!! Обеды и ужины в отеле также по меню, но уже за отдельную плату, так как у нас были только завтраки. Все очень вкусно!!! Заказывали сендвичи, креветки, ланкийскую кухню (она все равно острая, даже если им и говоришь, что не надо перчить)) всевозможные супы и т.д. Цены в ресторане конечно завышенные раза в 2. 
Во второй половине отпуска ездили в ресторан Bord'eau в 1.5 км. Там есть все что хочешь из морепродуктов - омары, креветки всевозможная рыба и т.д. Средний чек на двоих , средний омар в чесночном соусе , рис и салаты вытягивал на 60-80 $ Если заказать просто тигровых креветок с рисом и салатом выходило 30$ на двоих. Паста карбонара отличная и стоит всего 700 ланкийских рупий, на наши деньги 250 руб.  
Но главное - сам отель! 
Он находиться прямо в джунглях на первой пляжной линии. Достаточно далеко от основной дороги по побережью. Нам досталась вилла Mango! С потрясающим видом из номера через панорамное стекло от пола до потолка на джунгли! Все время джунгли жили прямо перед нами, бурундуки, обезьяны, вараны, ящерки и попугаи пробегали и пролетали мимо! Это было просто супер!!! Номер просторный, все необходимое имеется! Санузел чистый и тоже все необходимое (шампуни и гели) имеется. Уборка каждый день или по желанию. Спрашивают все время, нужен клининг и в какое время. Уборка на 5+. Молодые ланкийцы стараются вовсю, чтобы вам понравилось. Помимо основного номера у нас был сад, площадью 30-40 м.кв. с диванами и столиком для вечерних посиделок. 
Все время менеджер отеля (не помню имя, мы звали его просто Босс))) интересуется, все ли хорошо. Еще помогала хорошо девушка Нирода, она немного знает русский и мы могли с ней обсудить все вопросы в оперативном режиме!! В общем персоналу отеля 5+++ Все обаятельны и быстро решают любые проблемы.
Немного подпили крови москиты в первую ночь (потом поставили фумигатор), так что берите с собой всякие средства от насекомых.
Пляж и океан! 
Вид на бухту сно��сшибательный, слева рыбацкие лодки доходят до скал, справа песчаная коса около 1,5-2 км. Практически безлюдно, встречали пару, тройку людей за все время. В первый же день на рыбу, которые рыбаки оставили возле лодок сбежались 2х метровые вараны. Это было то еще зрелище!!! Волны в океан были, но небольшие, купаться одно удовольствие! Мы в бассейне за все время пару раз окунулись, все время в океане провели. Вода градусов 28, очень комфортно!! Два раза были волны и наш бич бой Судит вывешивал красный флаг, но мы все равно купались и Судит постоянно следил, чтобы с нами ничего не случилось! Ему отдельный привет!!! Очень хороший и интересный парень.
Бассейн отличный, рядом есть санузел и душ, смыть морскую воду. Весь отель в пальмах, так что есть где укрыться. Судит уже с утра раскладывал полотенца на те места, которые нам понравились- это сервис. 
Про экскурсии немного, брали сафари по реке 15$ с человека (очень красиво!!) и была поездка в Галле и в Хиккадуву к морским черепахам. В основном балдели в отеле и я хочу сказать, что отель превзошел все мои ожидания по сервису, видам и еде. Сюда надо ехать именно для уединения с океаном и природой! Движух и тусовок вы здесь не найдете, но вот ланкийский колорит, храмы и природа - это самый лучший релакс!!!
Если приедем на Шри-ланку, то только сюда. Это райское место!!! Спасибо всему персоналу отеля за классный отдых!!!","Райское место!!!

Yes, the furniture is not new, but everything works properly. The relaxation and level of service you receive - you forget about furniture or any other inconveniences.
Friends came to us to swim on our beach, since in other places there are very big waves, but here there is a beautiful quiet lagoon.

Great staff, food, service and all round hospitality which is not always the case in some hotels.
Best of all was how this hotel is laid out which means that all guests get their own privacy. The hotel was only half full when we visited but we felt like we had the place to ourselves. The villas are nice and spacious for two with their own patio / gardens. Nice gardens and walkways then lead you to the front restaurant / beach / pool area. Beach is wonderful - the kids could swim and there are no waves / rocks / undercurrents that you find in so many places along the coast.

We were looking for a private stay on the beach where we could spend some quiet time with the family.
    We stayed in various hotels around the island with equally various experiences. Here at Calamansi Cove, one enters a secluded little paradise, completely apart from the sometimes mad world of Sri Lanka. Separate, single storey villas are tucked into a beautifully groomed garden offering a sense of natural privacy. 
    We took two of their beach facing villas with a fresh water swimming pool directly at hand. The clean, white washed villas each had a small garden in the front that meant we could eat or meet with the family in privacy apart from the beach.
  The staff are exceptionally well mannered, polite, personable and happy to help. We felt very comfortable letting the children play unsupervised. Sujit, their Lifeguard, kept a constant eye on everything at the pool and beach which was very reassuring.
    The food was wonderful. Ample portions - with Western dishes and all the Sri Lankan dishes we could want, all served with characteristic charm.
     Even the afternoon rain showers were handled elegantly! It usually cleared quickly leading to some wonderful beach sunsets.
     I cannot imagine a better value. There were amenities offered that we didn't even need. It was a wonderful end to our holiday. I recommend everyone experience this gem of hospitality.","High quality, high value, natural comfort.","2023-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r928129376-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is in a quieter area of Hikkaduwa beach, which we really appreciated, but is still close to restaurants and grocery stores, and a short tuk tuk ride to the centre.
The beach is fabulous, stretching for what seems like miles in either direction, and wonderfully calm and peaceful close to the hotel.

Ich hatte kurzfristig gebucht. Der Kontakt über David Hopp war sehr gut. 

Ich war schon in vielen Hotels auf dieser Welt aber so einen Service habe ich noch nie erlebt. Vom Manager bis zu den Mitarbeitern, selbst die Frau die draußen gefegt hat - alle so freundlich und hilfsbereit. 

Die Toilettenspülung in meinem Zimmer funktionierte nicht und da gerade sonst keiner da war, hat sich der Security-Mann gleich darum gekümmert, obwohl das sicher nicht seine Aufgabe gewesen wäre. Als ich später am Abend vom Strandspaziergang kam, hat er mich bis zu meinen Zimmer geleitet und darauf geachtet, dass ich hinter mir ja abschließe. 

Die Pool-Suite war sehr schön und ich hab mich darin fast verloren. Vom Bett hat man den direkten Blick auf das Meer, so möchte man jeden Morgen wach werden. 

Siri - einer der Kellner spricht sogar deutsch. Es gibt noch einen weiteren Kellner, der deutsch spricht - leider weiß ich den Namen nicht.

Alles in allem war das ein GAANNZZZ toller Aufenthalt und ich habe es schwer bereut, dass es nur für eine Nacht war.

Half of that time (the relaxing half!) was spent based out of Suite Lanka in Hikkaduwa.  

A Colonial style hotel nestled neatly and beautifully on Narigama Beach (a 20 minute stroll south of the hugely inferior Hikka beach strip), Suite Lanka ticks all the boxes as a small, personal, quality and welcoming boutique hotel. We just loved it and departing after a week felt like leaving family - hugs were involved.
The hotel team runs to 13 staff - just about outnumbering guests- and everyone did everything they possibly could to make our week special. It’s such a team effort that I’m not going to pick out individual staff members for particular praise - they’re all getting a mention.  Siri, Roshan and Kumara as the management team were enormously helpful in facilitating trips and activities for us, as well as being all round good eggs. The restaurant is rightly very well regarded across Hikka and the service provided by Sithum and Madura is first rate.  The food is extremely good and whilst the kitchen team (that’ll be Janaka, Vishwq, Krishan and Kanthi - 👍) are rightly proud of their excellent curry and rice, the star of the show for us might well have been the Sri Lankan breakfast.  Sithum and Madura provide unobtrusive and excellent housekeeping (hibiscus flowers on the made beds every day!) and both Pradeep - security - and Shiroma - gardening- gave evening and morning smiles and waves respectively. 
Sri Lankan people are universally kind, gentle giving. Suite Lanka and its staff epitomise that. We’ll be back.","What a find!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r997490939-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Хочу поделиться своими впечатлениями об этом прекрасном месте.

Отель расположен  в самом центре Хиккадува. На побережье океана .

Персонал отеля был очень дружелюбным и гостеприимным, готовым помочь в любых вопросах и создать комфортную атмосферу.

Номера в отеле были чистыми и уютными . Из окон открывался потрясающий вид на океан. 

Завтраки в отеле были разнообразными и вкусными, предлагались блюда местной и европейской кухни. Обеды и ужины можно было заказать на свой вкус по меню ресторана. Трёх разовое питание у нас женой выходило в стоимость путевки.

Шеф-повару особая благодарность.

Территория отеля с не большим бассейном и зоной отдыха. 

Мы смогли насладиться красотой подводного мира и увидеть множество разнообразных рыб и других морских обитателей.

В целом, я остался очень доволен своим пребыванием в отеле Coral Rock by Bansei на острове Шри-Ланка. Рекомендую этот отель для отдыха и знакомства с красотами острова.

Обязательно вернусь на Шри Ланку .

И , надеюсь , не один раз.","Прекрасный отель чудесная страна.","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r986426105-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

В целом отелю можно поставить твердую 4*. Мы брали завтраки/ ужины. На завтрак всегда был шведский стол, если вы ждете европейский затрак, не ждите, из европейского был только омлет, но готовили его на 3. Завтраки однообразные больше заточены на местную кухню (сосиски с непонятным составом, лапша, рис, курица/рыба карри, немного овощей, печеные бобы, картофель, местные лепешки, оладьи, сухие завтраки) Если вы не придирчивы к еде то найдите что поесть, но если вы предпочитаете стандартный набор еды на утро, будет сложнее. Чай, кофе, молоко были всегда. Кофе не вкусный. Фрукты сезонные, у нас всегда были: ананасы, арбузы, бананы, папайя. Соки два варианта из пакета и смузи из фруктов. Ужины были заказное меню, но думаю именно это их и спасло, каждый вечер подавали разный набор, за 12 дней ни разу не повторились, ужина на 5. Всегда был салат, суп, на выбор горячее (курица, мясо, рыба) с разными гарнирами, сладкое на выбор или фруктовая тарелка или десерты ( кстати оказались очень вкусными!) также на ужин чай или кофе. Алкоголь по меню за отдельную плату, пиво в отеле самое дороге из всех рядом расположенных кафе 1200 рупий ( рядом в кафе 850-900, в магазине 570), коктейли примерно везде 1500- 3000 рупий.  Рядом огромное количество кафе, ресторанов, цены разные, качество еды тоже, нужно искать для себя. С видом на море дороже. Через дорогу дешевле, (например Skandia, отличное место через дорогу в сторону Hikka Tranz) в некоторые кафе можно со своим алкоголем. Средний чек на двоих с пивом по одному блюду на каждого 6800- 8500 рупий, ужины чуть дороже. Алко магазинов рядом тоже много. Виды из отеля конечно 5, уборка на 3, но для Азии норм, сервис на 5, все стараются помочь, подсказать. Сам отель маленький, номера тоже небольшие, нам достался даже без шкафа, вместо него была ниша с перекладиной. Интернет отличный на всей территории отеля. Если хорошо плаваете можно купаться прямо перед отелем, волна есть, но не критично, с детьми или тем кто плавать не умеет лучше уходить в сторону отеля Hikka Tranz, там нет волн и место кормления черепах. Все в шаговой доступности, очень удобно.","Отличный отдых, красивые виды","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d2440919-r985008372-Coral_Rock_By_Bansei-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Брали завтраки+ужины и остались очень довольны. Завтраки стандартные, а ужины - шедевр. За семь дней ужин ни разу не повторился. Необычные закуски, очень вкусные супы с горячими пышками и сливочным маслом, на горячее можно выбрать курицу, говядину или рыбу, а десерты - просто восторг - мороженое с панкейками, паннакота, брауни и много чего еще. За троих взрослых доплатили за ужины 100$. Если бы ужинали в барах, то вышло бы гораздо дороже. Рядом с отелем есть всё: рыбы, черепахи, рифовые акулы, мурены, огромные вараны и колония летучих лисиц (перейти через дорогу и немного углубиться, есть точка на гугл-карте).

Finger bowls provided and no issue (sorry that there was - this is not normal!); ice cream given is full scoops and we certainly provide french fries - I can only apologize if they were not there on your visit. Again, normally this is a daily item. You are correct that the childrens menu is somewhat limited to the staples and so we encourage guests to just ask for what they would like and it can be prepared directly.
Thanks again for the constructive input. We are better for it...
Best wishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wijerama Road Brahakmana Watte, Balapitiya 80550 Sri Lanka","Balapitiya","Sri Lanka","80550",,"Wijerama Road","Brahakmana Watte","7204642","6.284953","Balapitiya, Southern Province","80.0362","Calamansi Cove Villas","293","4.7","0","3","11","45","234","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g940979-d7204642-Reviews-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html","http://www.calamansicovevillas.com","2023-06-27","OTHER","4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We liked the design of the property as all rooms have their own sit-out / lounge area outside (loads of mozzies but the staff do come and light mosquito coils, definitely have repellent on you too if you want to enjoy sitting outside), the wash rooms have access from the outside as well so the room doesn't get messy with sand after a day at the beach and there is a terrace although we didn't use it - perhaps good if you have a crowd and want a secluded place to chill.

We were on B&B basis - the breakfast spread was extensive. We lasted well past lunch after having a full breakfast! The ala carte menu doesn't cater to kids much so if you have very young kids you may was to prepare for this or speak to the chef in advance and get something organised. (for example, they don't have regular potato chips... only fried manioc which was ok for us but some kids may not like the flavour). The quality of the food is good, but they use fancy dishes which meant we only got approximately a tablespoon of ice cream! (for desserts that came with ice cream). One of the kids use their fingers to have rice for lunch and when we asked for a finger bowl they said it's against the hotel's policy .... erm - it's a finger bowl?! You also don't get dinner rolls if you've only ordered a main course and not a soup / starter (!!!) 

We had a triple room and the linen on the extra bed was torn - which isn't on for a hotel of this  calibre. We noticed this on the morning of our check-out so didn't bother to / forgot to tell the staff.

The place is really nice, but we just felt like there were a few too many inconveniences.","Lovely property, but ...","2023-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r898418198-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

Just spent a wonderful weekend here staying at Passion and Pomello which we’re ocean facing villas by the pool.

The rooms were very comfortable and spacious for a family of four. The bed was big enough for the four of us (2 small kids and 2 adults) There is a lovely sitting area outside and also the rooftop (but there was no seating available)

The food was delicious- highly recommend the rice and curry options. We also had the a la carte food which was very tasty.

The service was incredible! Our butler Thilak made sure all our needs were met and went out of his way to make sure we were ok. The life guard (whose name I didn’t catch ) was very good and stayed by us when we were both in the sea and the pool. Nirodha at the front office was also very helpful.

The pool is just perfect and the bay outside was superb to bob up and down in the sea. 

All in all it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back again!","A slice of heaven in Balapitiya","2022-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r872063363-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

We were ten adults and eight children ranging from 10 to 1. The place is very well designed for families with small children. The setting is a beautifully maintained garden with villa type rooms, each with its own private garden, outdoor space, and some rooftop space. The food overall was excellent, with something different offered for each meal. However what I would really like to commend were the hotel staff, who made our stay exceptional. Sujith, the hotel lifeguard, made our trip so much easier. He was always attentive without being intrusive, very gentle with the kids, and thoroughly trustworthy. Our trip experience would have been very different without him always on guard. The two serving staff we encountered, Chandana and Thilak, were so friendly, and extremely accommodating and obliging. Also our reservation and check-in were managed excellently by Nirodha, who also took every effort to ensure that we had a great stay. Special mention must be made of Tommy the hotel dog (fully vaccinated), who was also a great companion for the kids. One small problem with our trip was that the sea was not swimmable during our stay. Apparently June is not a great time for the sea here. But overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend Calamansi Cove for groups with small children.","Great for Groups with Small Children","2022-06","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g940979-d7204642-r844310174-Calamansi_Cove_Villas-Balapitiya_Southern_Province.html",

This hotel was everything we could have wished for and more. They reserved the whole upmost floor of the hotel for our family of five (two very large suites, one with our own bathtub with a view of the sea and a huge balcony adjoining the suites and overlooking the ocean and the beautiful sunsets). The staff was so helpful, attentive and friendly that it really made us feel welcome.
The hotel is small and you got to know all the other guests due to the friendly and cosy atmosphere. The breakfast that was served to the table had nice variety and the Sri Lankan breakfast was simply wonderful, so flavourful and very filling. The rooms were cleaned every day (great because of the sand that still found its way in even though our best efforts to prevent it), and they decorated our beds and sofa with fresh flowers each time.
The pool was great with the kids, and the fact that you can step right out of the hotel to the beach was simply amazing. It wasn't quite the season yet so it was rather quiet and tranquil in Hikkaduwa, which suited us perfectly. We went running on the beach in the morning, and the hotel provided yoga mats so I could do my morning yoga on the beach or on the balcony.
The hotel arranged our safari trip perfectly and they had auyrveda massage partner as well. They were very helpful with everything we could ask. 
We like to experience new restaurants and go out to dine, but this time we stayed and dined at the hotel quite a few times because the restaurant was just amazing and the service was so friendly. Everything, especially the seafood was superb and the pricing was very reasonable given the prices in Hikkaduwa in general. 
A warm recommendation and a big thank you for the staff who made our stay in Sri Lanka unforgettable!","What an amazing experience!","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r981565229-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Wir freuen uns, dass Sie unsere Mitarbeiter auf einem guten Niveau finden. Seit wir einen neuen täglichen Poolreiniger gefunden haben – einen Behinderten aus der Gegend – glauben wir, dass unser Pool noch nie so gut war. Es stimmt, dass das Meer in fast ganz Sri Lanka außerhalb der Hochsaison rau sein und starke Strömungen aufweisen kann, sodass an vielen Teilen der Küste Vorsicht geboten ist. Der Turtle Beach, etwa 2 km von uns entfernt, ist die beste Option zum ruhigen Schwimmen. Wir wünschen Ihnen für die Zukunft viele schöne Feiertage.

Throughout our stay the staff did everything in their power to make sure we had a great time.

We also booked in for spa treatments, and it was the best the staff were so professional and were able to help and give advice to help my shoulder and back pain. The best spa treatment I’ve ever had.

We would like to give a special shout out to the staff that took care of us: Dulshan, Feros, Ashan, Rasika, Damitn, Dananjaya and a special thanks to the Resident manager, Dinusha Goonasena for specially helping our family during our stay.

It’s fantastic that Chef Naline, Imasha, our Pastry Chef, and the rest of the team made it so memorable from the local market visit to the hands-on cooking and enjoying your meal by the sea. 

We’re proud to offer unique, immersive experiences that connect our guests with Sri Lankan culture and cuisine, and it’s so rewarding to know it left such a positive impression. We look forward to welcoming you back for more unforgettable moments and culinary adventures. 

Ayubowan! (May you live long)

From beautifully proportioned rooms to open air spaces, the hotel stands a s aven of tranquility minutes away from the busting heart of the city. What used to be 3 houses alongside Colombo main road was metamorphosed into a boutique hotel. Though multi storey constructions have since sprouted out of the ground by the Galle green, the Colombo Court standa as a witness of the intricate balance of Colombo spirit ,: between offshore influences, lush nature and climate and bustling energy of the Sri Lankan people, it reflects urban tropical modernism in a applied acception.
Once checked-in  never to be forgotten. Mishfa and Mohammed at the reception are more family than hosts. Always keen to keep in touch and assist with additional support.","In Colombo cultural epicenter","2025-05","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r1011834290-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

She was professional and I felt relaxed even though spa was simple and small. The food at the roof top cloud cafe was delicious. Compliments to the chef! The breakfast platters served at the poolside cafe were good especially the srilankan platter. The water temperature in the pool was perfect. Jacuzzi offered a cool dip. It is not a hot jacuzzi as summer time it is hot outside. Location was perfect as the marino mall is only a 7 minute walk and it offers a variety of halal restaurants serving srilsnkan, far eastern, Chinese and Arabic food.

The pool is clean & so nice to relax around. They have many things to do, we didn’t want to leave.
The staff are all AMAZING!! They are so happy, polite & professional. Anything you need they are there.
The food is so good, I especially loved the chicken tikka masala… it’s amazing.
I would stay here every time I come to Colombo. Thank you to all the staff.

My mother and I had an amazing stay at Mandarina Colombo, and we couldn’t be happier with the service we received. From the moment we arrived late at night, Pubudu and Rehan made check-in seamless and welcoming, ensuring we were comfortable after a long journey. Similarly, during our late-night checkout, they made the process just as smooth.  

A special thank you to Leon, who went above and beyond to help us plan our 3-day itinerary. His insights and recommendations truly made our trip memorable, and we appreciated his patience and local knowledge.  

The hotel itself was fantastic—clean, comfortable, and in a great location.

The location is beautiful - absolute beach front with the sounds of waves 24/7. You can eat right beside the beach for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The rooms are colonial style with loads of character which we love. Very clean and tidy. Comfy beds too. 
Nothing was too much trouble, the staff are so friendly and accomodating. The food is delicious and the breakfast selection perfect. Make sure you order their Sri Lankan style breakfast the night before if you want that as an option. We ended up eating here most evenings too because it was so good. 
The pool is a good size and always clean, we enjoyed cooling off a few times in it after a hot day browsing the Hikkaduwa area. 
They even have a super friendly onsite dog and although there are a few stray dogs around (typical for this part of Sri Lanka) even they are super friendly and delightful company! We wish we could have brought one in particular home with us, he was such a gentle natured boy. 
Price is very reasonable we think, you wont regret staying here. 
Just a note that the beach isn't safe for swimming, but just being right on the beach is so beautiful you wont miss the ocean dip - just use the pool instead or go for a swim at nearby Turtle Bay.","A little gem in Hikkaduwa - and beach front perfection!","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r972590974-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The fact that it is a small boutique hotel means that it is always quiet even when fully booked. The staff are so kind, attentive and friendly making the effort to get to know you personally. 

The facilities are just what you need to relax and soak up the amazing beach scenery. 

The restaurant Olins is incredible with fresh and tasty options made in a clean and professional environment. I would highly recommend the Sri Lankan breakfast and the Sri Lankan curries as my personal favourites, although there are multiple other tasty options. The food was so good that I would return to the hotel for meals regularly and only ate out a handful of times.

The restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes and all the meals that we had were excellent.

Just finished a whistle stop tour of Sri Lanka.  9 hotels in 14 days ranging from small boutiques to large complexes and this was arguably my favorite of the lot!

We stayed in the Pool room which as the name suggests had access to both the pool and the beach. Plenty of room for 2 teens and 2 adults and very tastefully furnished.

A wonderful Sri Lankan breakfast (easily the best breakfast of my trip). Nice bar area and pool also which the kids enjoyed.

However,  its the staff that really make this venue. Friendly, cheerful, helpful. They are everything the hospitality trade should be.

Nothing is too much trouble for them, they are both friendly, helpful and hard working, always on hand to help with any little thing, even if it is just local travel advice. The deputy manager Kumarasiri was especially friendly and made sure our every need was met.
The room was huge an easily accomodated the four of us, we had the pool suite which opened on both sides, to the pool and also the beachfront garden, where you can dine, use the sunbeds or just relax on a sofa and read, that's if you don't want to sit on your large balcony.
The beds were very comfortable and the 4-poster in the main room was huge. everything was provided in the bathroom, loads of towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel.
The restaurant and dining were fabulous, breakfast has a range of options from traditional Sri Lankan breakfast with sambal and rice to continential or cooked, loads of fresh fruit and juice, and of course tea, it wouldn't be Sri Lanka without Ceylon tea. Evening meals were fabulous, we ate there most nights, very reasonable pricing for such tasty and feshly cooked food, i particularly enjoyed the black pork curry and my kids loved the fried noodles and fried rice.
Our kids loved the pool area, it's secluded and sheltered, right next to the rooms and the pool bar.
The hotel itself is secured at night and has a permanent security guard once the staff go home, the guard is a lovely fellow, constantly patrolling and keeping an eye out which is very reassurring. 
One day we had to leave to go to the temple at a very early hour of 5am, so the hotel prepared us packed breakfasts (which they didn't have to do) and the security guard made sure we had them ready for when we left.
I cannot reccomend this place more highly, out of the 5 places we stayed in Sri Lanka, from east to west coast, this was the highlight and the best accomodation experience, it way exceeeded my expectations, especially given the very cheap price, i would not have expected somewhere so good at such a low price per night for 4 people.","An amazing colonial-style boutique hotel with fabulous staff and facilities","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r965954499-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is immaculate which is a credit to all the staff who work to ensure our stay was perfect not just from cleaning the room daily but those cheerful staff who keep the grounds so clean everyday.

The breakfast options are perfect, I would highly recommend the homemade muesli, it was delicious.  We opted to try the evening meals, this was absolutely superb, the quality and taste of the food was incredible, and was beautifully presented that we decided to eat at the restaurant every evening throughout our stay.

A special shout out to Kumarisir (I think that’s how you spell it) he was so welcoming on our arrival, ensured everything was perfect,  and always remembered what we had to drink.

We would definitely return to Suite Lanka and hopefully have the opportunity to stay in the Penthouse Suite.","Wonderful Hotel and amazing food","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1181608-r965785026-Suite_Lanka-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Some quibbles: 
1. The Deluxe Room during my first stint had two odd cement blocks right in the middle of the room blocking view of the TV from almost all angles. 
2. Some work needs to be done on the Menu. The choice of soups is limited and unimaginative. For a coastal hotel, fish options are slender. Further, one had expected the Menu to have a set Sri Lankan meal, vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
3. The Spa is closed on Wednesdays, the only day I had for a look-in.

The grounds are very well kept. The pool is gorgeous and super clean. Be sure to ask for cushions for the chairs. 

The food was delicious. We got half board and ate breakfast and dinner here. The array of desserts is amazing. All of the staff is friendly and ready to help. 

As a bonus, there’s lots of beautiful wildlife here. On the way to check out this morning I saw langurs and an orange kitty. We also saw macaques, peacocks, and lots of cute dogs.

This resort really lives up to its name: it's a paradise for families, nature lovers, and anyone who needs some peace and quiet in nature.

We were warmly welcomed as soon as we got there. Oh, it was unforgettable: it was traditional, elegant, and felt personal. It was amazing that they put a sash around our necks, which we got to keep as a nice keepsake. I think Team Occidental truly lives up to hospitality. 

The chalets were big and well-kept, and they were comfortable because they were in a beautiful natural setting. We loved waking up to the sound of birds and seeing peacocks walking around the grounds. It was like living in a nature documentary!

The pool area was great because it had separate areas for adults and kids. Our kids had a great time. Another great thing was the in-room dining. It was tasty, easy, and served with care.

There was a lot of food, it was different, and it was all very good. There was food for everyone, from local favorites to kid-friendly choices.

But the hospitality was what really stood out. We've stayed at a lot of places, but this team was the best. The Resident Manager and the General Manager both came to see us in person, which was a rare and nice gesture that made us feel very important. Thanks a lot to Ashan and the rest of the team for going above and beyond.

If you’re ever heading to Dambulla, Occidental Paradise should be on your must-visit list. It's more than just a hotel; it's the best way to experience Sri Lankan hospitality, nature, and warmth.

Special thanks to Ruwan (group accounts manager) for helping me out with the last-minute reservation.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your valuable feedback. We're delighted to know that your overnight stay was comfortable and that you appreciated the early check-in at no extra charge, as well as the convenience of a late check-out. It's wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your meal at the poolside restaurant, and we're glad the dishes were satisfying.

We sincerely apologize for your less-than-ideal dining experience at the rooftop terrace. Your comments regarding portion sizes and taste are noted, and we will review this with our culinary team to ensure better value and quality moving forward.

We’re also pleased to hear that you found our hotel and rooms well-maintained, and that the comfortable beds contributed to a good night’s sleep. However, we regret that the jacuzzis were unavailable during your stay. We understand this may have been disappointing, and we’ll work on minimizing such inconveniences in the future.

Your observations regarding staff attentiveness are appreciated. While our goal is to provide attentive service, we will ensure that it does not come across as overbearing.

Thank you again for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. It helps us improve and enhance the experiences we offer. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back for an even better stay in the future.

Danach aßen wir noch etwas im Pool Restaurant was sehr lecker war und auch ausreichend und preislich noch ok ( Pizza Margarita & Biriyani).

Thank you so much for sharing your delightful experience with us! We are thrilled to hear that your stay at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa was a memorable and positive conclusion to your Sri Lankan adventure.

It’s heartwarming to know that you enjoyed your upgraded room and its luxurious features, including the canopy bed, spacious bath, and wraparound balcony. Your excitement truly resonates with our efforts to create a unique and inviting atmosphere for our guests.

We're equally pleased that you appreciated the pool and rooftop bar, as well as our carefully curated menu. It’s wonderful to hear that our breakfast pastries stood out for you—it’s always our goal to bring a touch of excellence to every detail.

Vihan, Hanfal, and Mark will be delighted to know that their service left such a positive impression. Our team takes great pride in making every guest feel welcomed and valued.

Regarding the government tax and service charge, we truly understand your surprise. These charges are set by the Sri Lankan government, and while we must adhere to these regulations, we regret any inconvenience it caused. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you once again for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to share your kind words. It was a pleasure to host you, and we hope to welcome you back on your next visit to Colombo!

As it was only one night I wasn’t fussed about where the agent booked so I didn’t even google before arriving at Colombo Court. 
This place is spectacular when you know what you’re getting, imagine my delight when I’d been expecting a room with bed. 

 Vihan, Hanfal and Mark met us at reception and provided exemplary service. I received a free room upgrade and squealed with delight upon seeing the canopy bed, ginormous bath and the wrap around balcony. It was all stunning. 

The pool is gorgeous and the rooftop bar has been done to a really high spec. The whole experience felt like we’d stepped into a hidden oasis in the middle of the bustling noise of Colombo. 

The menu was also excellent. Benefit of being a city, they have figured out how to do breakfast pastries properly. This is notable because all the local breads we’d had to date, all tended to be on the sweet side (no matter if there is fish or onion within).

I did get whacked with an unexpected and sizeable government tax/service charge on some wine which was almost 25% of the total bill. This hasn’t happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka so it was a bit of a shock (10% service charge was the norm in the more built up touristy areas). But hey ho. The room and facilities are what I’ll be remembering for a long time to come.","Excellent experience, gorgeous room","2025-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r989751303-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The buffets had excellent spread from Western to Chinese to Local dishes including lot of local fruit varieties. Credit to Chef Mr. Fernando. 

A good place to do recreational activities and some adventure activities. Mr. Darshana and Mr. Saman were really good and attentive. The Spa was also good.  

Very close proximity to Sigiriya, Dambulla and National Parks like Minneriya, Kaudulla and Hurulu. 

Ancient cities like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa is about 60-90 minutes' drive from the hotel. 

Suggestion
Request to put a twin or proper double beds to upper deck of the duplex units as that will be more comfortable to accommodate 4-5 member family. The units have enough space surely. Just give a thought about it.

The hotel is located very close to Bandaranaike International Airport, which makes it an ideal choice for travelers with early flights or layovers.

The check-in process was quick and smooth, and the staff were polite. The room was clean, quiet, and equipped with all the basic amenities needed for a short stay, including a comfortable bed, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and a private bathroom with hot water.

The hotel offers a restaurant with a decent selection of meals and snacks, which was convenient after a long journey. I also appreciated the airport shuttle service, which was punctual and saved me the stress of finding transportation.

Though it’s mainly a transit hotel, Ramada Seeduwa maintains good standards in cleanliness and service.","Can have a peaceful sleep for a exhausted person","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1500185-d1514317-r1007900510-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Katunayake_Colombo_International_Airport-Katunayake_Negombo_.html",
