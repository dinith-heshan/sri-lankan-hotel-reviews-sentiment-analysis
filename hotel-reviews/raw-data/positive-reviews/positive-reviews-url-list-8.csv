From the day we arrived until the day we left, the staff and management looked after us so well, it really felt like home.

The location of the resort is beautiful. It’s up in the mountains, and we had the most amazing views from our Beehive Room, the swimming pool, and even the dining area. Everywhere you looked, there were stunning mountain views.

One thing that really stood out to us was how well they looked after our food needs. We don’t eat onion or garlic, and every day the chef made us special meals off the menu. It meant a lot to us and made our stay even more comfortable.

What we loved the most was their attitude. It felt like the word “no” didn’t exist for them. Every request we had, big or small, was taken care of with a smile.

Since we stayed there for 6 nights, the resort even surprised us with a small going-away gift. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made us feel really special.

We left with lovely memories and so much appreciation for the whole team.","The best Stay at Dream Cliff Mountain Resort","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r1014771202-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

Sweeping views looking towards the south eastern part of the country with rolling hills sloping toward the planes dotted with ancient tanks, paddy fields and jungles. The backdrop was the majestic cliffs of the Haputale Range. Very well kept dome shaped rooms, two pools including one infinity pool merging with the rolling hills and the planes. All the staff, service and the food were excellent.  The manager Mr Raphael Dias had his feet firmly on the ground and took good care of us. Steward Athula went out of his way assisted by Pradeep, to mention only a few.  Reminded us of     Rev Walter Stanley Senior, that English poet with a Sri Lankan heart, who was in love with this area and whose  ashes are interred at the most picturesque St. Andrew's Church, Haputale, nearby.

The beehive cabanas are all overlooking the beautiful and breathtaking Beragala gap, with the udawalawe reservoir in the back ground. We spent hours on our balcony as the view seemed to change every few minutes based on the sun! When it was behind a cloud the mist slowly crept in between the mountains creating shadows on land below, and when the sun came out the mist disappeared illuminating the hills and valleys. We were even able to experience the early morning sunrise and evening sunset from the comfort of our balcony.
The resort is above a panoramic view of mountain ranges with an infinity pool that allows us to soak in the sun while enjoying the view.

The restaurant is very spacious and the food was delicious! The staff were very accommodating and went over and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.
We went on a hike and the hotel arranged transport and a guide to take us which was very helpful. The village trek ends at a beautiful waterfall which was a thrill for all of us.
Highly recommend this resort as a hill country getaway!

La piscina es preciosa con todas las vistas a la naturaleza desde el agua... El restaurante está detrás y tomar algo al atardecer es una gran experiencia. 
La cena y desayuno muy correcto y siempre intentando agradar y hacer lo que mejor te convenga. Nosotros desayunamos el ""continental"" y estaba lleno de comida, diferentes panes, confituras, croissants, zumos, cafés, y huevos del tipo que quieras que te cocinan y te traen a la mesa. 
Las habitaciones son cabañas muy auténticas en medio de la naturaleza. Yo estaba dentro de la habitación y por mi terraza cruzaron varias veces diferentes animales, mamíferos, con toda tranquilidad pensando que no había nada. La habitación es una única pieza como una cabaña que se comunica baño y habitación por arriba y la acústica es diferente (con eco) por la forma de la cabaña pero es una experiencia única. Las habitaciones (cogimos 2 cabañas porque íbamos con niños) muy limpias, el aire acondicionado funcionaba perfectamente, el baño y la ducha super agradables (suelo de piedras, jabones todo lo que necesitábamos estaba) y las camas muy cómodas. 
El personal en todo momento nos ayudó con maletas, con los niños y estuvo pendiente de que pasaramos una velada fantástica y así fue.

Une affaire de goût, en effet…
Pour notre part, nous avons à peu près tout apprécié ici: l’accueil bien sûr, la vue époustouflante sur la vallée et les collines environnantes mais aussi la décoration de l’hôtel et du bungalow (on peut ne pas aimer le Bleu de Klein),  et l’originalité de cette salle de bain. Alors, c’est vrai qu’il y a un petit problème d’intimité et que la cloison séparant chambre et salle de bain gagnerait à être étendue jusqu’au plafond car en plus, les sons sont amplifiés par la configuration bungalow. La cuisine, loin d’être infecte, est goûteuse, surtout les spécialités sri-lankaises.
La bouteille d’eau pétillante de 37 cl est facturée 350 Rs soit environ 1,2 €, les cocktails environ 8€, les petits pain (qu’il faut réclamer car ils ne les portent pas spontanément) sont délicieux, servis chaud avec du beurre salé.
Le repas d’hier soir était un grand moment, agrémenté en outre d’un accompagnement musical sous la forme d’un joueur de flûte dispensant une musique très zen.
Le petit-déjeuner sri-lankais est excellent, généreux et équilibré. Si vous préférez, un petit déjeuner continental est proposé, qui est très correct.
La piscine à débordement est superbe, exposée plein sud et s’ouvrant sur le paysage grandiose de la vallée, et suffisamment grande pour qu’on puisse nager sans atteindre le bord opposé au bout de 10 ou 12 brasses.
N.B: À notre arrivée à hier, notre guide et notre chauffeur ont eu droit comme nous à une serviette et une boisson rafraîchissantes.","Une affaire de goût ?

Staff are well meaning and in abundance , they may not speak much English- but I didn’t even try to communicate in Singhalese. There are only 12 rooms - all are very spacious and decorated with individual mahogany furniture . It’s NOT the Hilton or Radisson … thank goodness…. So don’t expect mini bar and extensive menu . The dinner from the limited menu was delicious , I would like to have seen more local dishes on offer . No wine license - but take your own.
A peaceful retreat , very serene , no piped music, and a feeling that you are staying in a friend’s home.
There is a resident turtle in the pond , peacocks grace the courtyard in the morning, monkeys can be seen in the jungle behind , a mongoose crossed the drive this morning.
I hope no one spoils this little haven .

I visted this heaven with my family members for a small family get together. Their service was superb and the food was really good. I have worked with this lovely staff for about two years and after a long time I have visited there. But still their hospitality service is in a high level as those days.
I really feel like that I have entered to my second home. Special thank for Mr.Sanjaya, F & B team, Sakuna, Edirisingha and Lahiru for giving us a great experience .

We stayed in the Black Rajah ultra room and yes, the very old, arched louvre doors may not fit like plastic double glazed doors but it’s not, as in a previous review, below the restaurant - the restaurant is further along the corridor on the same level, and is outside. One thing I will mention about Black Raja - there is a lovely open courtyard enroute to the restaurant with comfy seating, bang opposite the room- and we could clearly hear the torrential rain in the night through the opening.
 Our butler, Neemal, looked after us very well, always at the front door to open the car door with an umbrella (we had rain everyday), get us drinks, take our menu order & then serve at the table - lovely man. We only had dinner one night but thoroughly enjoyed it - choice of 2 starters, 3 mains & several desserts, all well cooked & tasty. Breakfast was plentiful. One thing I would mention is that wherever your room is, there are about 10 steps down to the lower floor for the restaurant, without a handrail - I’m not great at going downstairs but found I could put a steadying hand on the side - I know Neemal would have helped had I not been comfortable.
One thing I would mention, again because of the rain, we couldn’t use our outdoor space, whereas some suites on the ground floor were under cover, with sun beds, so could be utilised regardless of the weather.
We would definitely recommend a stay here - it’s quiet, with beautiful grounds & pool & a good proximity to Kandy.","Ultra room - Black Raja","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r990856479-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

1. Питание: 3,6 (3,5).
1.1. Завтрак: 3,5
Завтраки однообразные - несколько видов яиц, два вида сосисок, один вид сыра, несколько видов выпечки, вафли, один вид каши и супа. Чай пакетированный и заварной. Кофе - вообще сложно его назвать таковым, как и почти во всех отношениях на Шри-Ланке. Соки натуральные , но разбавленные водой.
1.2. Обед: 4,0.
Обеды не плохие, иногда даже по ассортименту преобладают над ужином.
Два вида супа, один вид мяса, курица, два вида рыбы,3-4 салатов, 4-5 гарниров, чай/кофе, 3-4 вида фруктов, 4-5 видов выпечки, мороженое. Минус - не всегда полноценные обеды, т.к. большинство туристов на концепции завтрак-ужин.
1.3. Ужин: 4,0.
Ужины также не плохие.
Два вида супа, один вид мяса (но оно всегда резиновое), курица, два вида рыбы,3-4 салатов, 4-5 гарниров, чай/кофе, 3-4 вида фруктов, 4-5 видов выпечки, мороженое.
1.4. Напитки: 4,0.
Здесь оценка по напиткам в барах. На всё включено:
- Местный крепкий алкоголь (ром - Rockland ""советую"", джин, виски, водка, содовая, имбирное безалкогольное пиво, алкогольное пиво в бутылке ""Lion"", молочные коктейли, фруктовые фреши.
1.5. Закуски (между основными приемами пищи): 1,5.
В первый день пришли в основной ресторан на закуски с сыном, спрашиваем: где закуски?
Они на нас смотрят и молчат. Через 3 минуты, смотрим забегали. Через 10-15 минут принесли сэндвичи, кексы и печенье с чаем. Больше мы на перекус не ходили. Короче можно сказать, что закусок - нет.

2. Пляж и его инфраструктура: 3,8 (4,0).
2.1. Размер: 4,0.
Хороший размер пляжа. Есть простор для прогулок по побережью бухты.
2.2. Чистота пляжа: 4,0.
Убирают, но можно и лучше. В данной бухте около 10 отелей, наш отель и ещё 2-3 отеля, где убирают мусор, на остальных просто свалка...
2.3. Чистота моря: 3,5.
Через день в море плавает мусор. Когда мусора нет, море - хорошее.
2.3. Насекомые: 3,0.
Много насекомых, в т.ч. пляжных блох. Мы все были покусанные. Это очень большой минус отеля. За 20 дней отдыха травили насекомых только один раз.
2.4. Заход: 4,5.
Заход пологий, очень подходндля купания с детьми.
2.5. Картинка: 4,5.
Пляж красивый, как и большинство на Шри-Ланке.
2.6. Пляжный бар: 2,5.
Его в принципе пока нет, идёт строительство.
Действующий бар - это как деревянный киоск. Бармена постоянно нет на месте. Играешь в рулетку, идёшь на пляж и не знаешь будет бармен или нет.
Наливают только напитки. Если хочешь коктейль или сок, нужно идти в основной бар.
2.7. Зонты, лежаки и полотенца: 3,5
Зонтов очень мало, наверное 5-6 шт, поэтому все туристы лежат под пальмами и деревьями. Лежаков много, полотенца - безлимит.

3. Уровень обслуживания: 4,3 (4,5).
3.1. Заселение: 4,0.
Приехали в отель около 10 часов утра. Как и во всех отелях на Шри-Ланке предложили фрэши из натуральных фруктов и теплые полотенчики, для лица. Заселили довольно быстро - через 1 час.
3.2. Уборка номера: 5,0.
Лучшие.
3.3. Персонал бара: 3,5.
Персонал преимущественно низкоквалифицированный. Один и тот же напиток могут приготовить совершенно по разному, некоторые стараются. Если бы не они поставил бы 2,0.
3.4. Персонал ресторана: 3,0.
Очень медлительные, также как и работники бара преимущественно низкоквалифицированный персонал. Некоторые неплохо работают, стараются. Только из-за них 3,0.
3.5. Персонал ресепшн: 5,0.
Одни из лучших, которых я встречал в жизни.
3.6. Время реагирования на запросы: 5,0.
Абсолютная обратная связь от персонала. Звонишь на ресепшн, очень быстро решают любой вопрос.

4. Номера: 3,9 (4,0).
4.1. Размер: 5,0.
4.2. Душ/туалет (качество сантехнического оборудования): 4,0.
Душ (ванная) отдельно от туалета. Размер хороший. Единственный минус - текла лейка. Поэтому 4 бала.
4.3. Ванные принадлежности: 3,0.
С этим к сожелению посадка. Из принадлежностей только универсальный гель для мытья всего (как говорится от головы до пяток).
4.4. Кровать: 4,0.
Хороший матрас, неплохие подушки.
4.5. Чистота и порядок: 5,0
Уборку происходят очень качественно (с полной заменой белья, протиркой мебели, подметанием и мойкой полов), за это большой респект. Я думаю здесь лучший пример , как нужно убирать номера.
4.6. Балкон: 3,5.
Неплохой вид.
Два стула, столик и множество насекомых (в основном муравьи).
Сушка для белья отсутствует.
4.7. Звукозащищенность: 3,0.
В ванной и туалете очень хорошо слышно, что происходит на улице. В комнате прекрасно слышна жизнедеятельность соседних номеров.
3,0 т.к. эта программа абсолютно почти всех отелей в мире.
4.8. Пополнение холодильника: -.
Холодильник ни разу не пополнялся. Но это общая практика здесь. Оценку не буду учитывать в расчете.

5. Бассейн: 2,8 (3,0).
5.1. Размер: 3,0.
Для Шри-Ланки средний бассейн.
5.2. Безопасность: 1,0.
Бассейн состоит из основной и детской части. Плитка на дне бассейна сильно изношена, а в детской части бассейна сколота. Мои двое маленьких детей 1 и 4 года, порезали все подушечки пальцев ног и рук (фото приложу). Детский бассейн вообще не безопасный, купаться в нем детям не рекомендую.
После инцидента с порезом ног и рук, обратился на ресепшн. В ответ на обращение, поставили табличку, что купаться запрещено. Но убеждён, что после нашего отъезда они её убрали и открыли опасную детскую часть бассейна.
5.3. Ночная подсветка: 3,5.
Подсветка есть, но её включают не всегда!?
5.4. Чистота: 3,5.
Средний по чистоте бассейн.

6. Развлечения: 1,8 (2,0).
6.1. Анимация: -.
Её нет. Для Шри-Ланка это норма, поэтому не буду учитывать эту оценку при расчете.
6.2. Вечерние шоу (концерт): 3,0.
Дни чередуются: живая музыка, пара ""кабальеро"" с гитарой и барабаном и просто без развлечений. Но для Шри-Ланки, это нормально.
6.3. Водные горки: -
Их нет, но т.к. это не Турция или Египет, а Шри-Ланка, не буду учитывать эту оценку при расчете.
6.4. Детская комната: 0,5.
Не детская комната, просто ""позор"".
Телевизор и несколько мягких элементов и игрушек. Но из-за плохого запаха туда не хочется заходить. Вечером на мягких элементах спят работники и официанты бара и ресторана. Возможно этим и обусловлен плохой запах.
6.5. Фитнес зал: 3,0.
Для Шри-Ланки средненький зал. Свободные веса, один неплохой многофункциональный тренажёр, велотренажёры и беговые дорожки.
Кондиционер, велотренажёры и беговые дорожки выключены. Скорее всего из-за экономии.
6.6. Детские площадки: -
Их просто нет.
6.7. Игры (в т.ч. спортивные): 2,5.
Из игровых развлечений: прокат велосипедов и пинпонг.
Но в комнате, где расположен стол для пинпонга не возможно находиться, в связи с тем, что кондиционер постоянно выключают. Они здесь постоянно экономят на работе кондиционеров.

7. Территория: 3,6 (3,5).
7.1. Размер: 3,0.
Небольшая компактная территория. Погулять особо не получится.
7.2. Растения: 3,5.
Т.к. эта поездка для меня четвертая на Шри-Ланку, есть с чем сравнить. Поэтому только 3,5. Объективно, растений для Шри-Ланки не очень много.
7.3. Картинка: 5,0.
Территория очень фотогигиенична, из любой точки получаются превосходные фото.
7.4. Газон и озеленение: 3,0.
Газон в начале отдыха был зелёный, но во второй половине местные садовники, перестали его качественно поливать. В результате чего он стал с желтыми фрагментами.

8. Качество и скорость интернета: 4,0 (4,0).
18 из 20 дней интернет был стабильный, хотел поставить 5 балов, но в последние два дня почему-то происходили сбои.

9. Прочее: 3,3 (3,5).
9.1. Отсутствие строек (ремонтов): 1,0.
Во время нашего отдыха, ежедневно была стройка нового бара и проводили текущий ремонт зданий и сооружений.
9.2. Ланч-боксы при отъезде: 4,5
Добротные Ланч-боксы, в составе варёных яиц, круасанов, бананов, йогуртов, и т.д.
9.3. Сейф: 4,5.
Хороший сейф, за 20 дней хорошо работал.

10. Удаленность от моря: 5,0 (5,0).
Отель расположен на первой линии. С учётом, что территория не очень большая, время до моря из любой точки отеля не более 3 минут.

Итоговая оценка: 3,7.","Нормальный отель на 3+, здесь оценки сильно завышены.","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r1013117057-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

I was there with my 7 y.o. daughter and she said ""I feel in my element"". It's a bit adventurous, but very premium. The service is top, the staff very caring and helpful, Prince Solomons is the naturalist leading the camp's safaris and wildlife stories, a very nice old chap filled with experience, wisdom, and kindness. The tents are cozy, albeit the few bugs - but if you book there, that is part of the thrill! We've relished in staying in during the afternoon downpour, as the sound of the forest and rain was highly soothing. At night, the camp becomes kind of magical, with all lanterns alight against bugs and reptiles, and the bonfire during dinner time. My daughter wandered around the grounds feeling safe and happy in the nature. We enjoyed the beautiful meals, generous and tasty, with fresh veggies and local dishes. The half-day morning safari was a must, and with Prince Solomons as our guide, we had a fabulous time, spotting birds and elephants and having nice conversations. We were also lucky to have booked at the end of April, when the wet season nears, and when it becomes more quite on the tourists' front. Also, rain brings the animals out. One half-day safari in Uda Walawe is sufficient, and 2 nights is recommended, as you need to settle into the glamping lifestyle.","Glamping & Safari at Mahoora / Udawalawe","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r1004784069-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We've stayed at the Echo team's Ahaspokuna location and had a lovely time there, so decided to choose this place which was right along our route. We booked without much expectations but had a perfect experience!

Location - Google map directions are accurate, but you might miss the turn - off which is a tiny dirt road in between two houses. The road condition is perfect up to the turn - off, which is a dirt road but still in good condition. It's quite a sizeable, lovely looking property right next to a lake/ tank and the grounds were very well maintained. They had mowed the grass and there was no undergrowth which made it look very safe and airy. It may look a bit dark in the night, but they have an army of staff constantly checking the grounds with flashlights and also two doggies who kept us company so we felt quite comfortable even in the dark.

Accommodation took the form of tents. Compared to their Ahaspokuna property, the tents were more ""camping"" than ""glamping"". I am not sure whether there were different categories of tents. But our tent had a bed which more or less filled the front part, and the commode and shower were only partitioned off from a curtain. Probably due to the shower plumbing being inside the tent, we found two geckos and a tiny frog in our tent (which we didn't mind though). There was a fan in the room which was perfectly fine with us and the weather was quite cool due to heavy rains. 

Before we checked in, the manager had a small chat with us. He told us that we may find the mattress a bit thin and water pressure of the shower and commode would be low. We didn't find any problem with the mattress and slept perfectly fine! The water pressure of the commode was also perfectly fine but we did find the water pressure of the shower to be a bit of a nuisance, but wrote it down as an authentic camping experience;). Can't recall about WiFi though as our own connections worked just fine. 

What really elevated this property was their service!. We arrived at 2 pm, while we were checking in, the manager had a small chat with us explaining about the property, once that was done, we were told our tent was ready. The bags came right after. We said we'll come for lunch in 10 mts and they were ready and waiting for us. Dinner was ready exactly at 7 pm. Both the lunch and dinner service was fast and worked like clockwork. We were told that morning snacks would be ready by 5.45 am and we would be leaving at 6 am for the safari. Snacks were there at 5.40 am and they left exactly at 6 am! We returned at 10 am as planned and check - out didn't even take 10 minutes. Considering that we tropical islanders are not known for their punctuality, we were blown away by how well they managed all the tasks on time. And all the staff we met were friendly, courteous, enthusiastic and very efficient.

The food was very good and was quite unexpected for a camping experience. The lunch was rice & curry and the dinner was a four course set menu. The portions were large. We had a packed breakfast for the safari and we were pleasantly surprised to find that they had packed everything they would have offered for a full course breakfast! When my husband informed them he was a vegetarian, they also came up with quite a lot of vegetarian options. 

We also had a lovely safari experience with them. The driver was safe and reliable, our guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The packed breakfast was lovely. And they left exactly on time, so that we arrived as early as possible which ensured that we had enough elephant sightings to make the trip worthwhile. [The property is actually situated about 30 minutes away from the park entrance and there was quite a hurried drive to get there as early as possible. One suggestion would be to give the guests the option to leave earlier if they are willing to do so. ] I have written a separate review on the Udawalawe National Park which covers our experience there. 

The price charged under local resident rates was extremely reasonable. We were quite happy to pay that price with or without the safari. The booking mail mentioned that we would have to pay separately for the naturalist on the safari, but they didn't charge  us in the end. The mail also mentioned a nature walk which obviously was not possible due to heavy rains. 

All in all, we loved our experience there, the service, the staff, the very well organised safari making it one of those rare occasions where we had already planned for a return trip, hopefully during July-August since, according to our naturalist, that is the best time a do a safari in Udawalwe.","Camping done right...","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r1004588920-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We booked in advance & requested Prince Solomon as our guide. Lovely man, softly spoken, decades of experience in the park. A true naturalist! Great English. Respected by the other guides. We had a private jeep with a driver. My husband likes to photograph, so this was perfect. 

The park is busy & when all the jeeps take off together, it’s not great. But once we got away & deeper in the park was where the magic was. Wild elephants, hundreds of migrating birds. Also enjoyed driving from Mahoora to the entrance in the dark as the sun rose.

We were met by Santosh who checked us in efficiently and was always contactable throughout our stay. All members of staff were so friendly and delightful. Always greeted us with a lovely smile.
Our tend was amazing. We had everything we needed and more. We enjoyed the accommodation very much. These tents are far superior to a majority of similar camps we have stayed in other countries during our game drives.
Dinner was served around a campfire which was a great experience. Meals were plated and brought to us straight from the kitchen. Food was of a high standard and very well presented. Most of all, a big thank you to the young man who served us and compliments to the chef for a great dining experience under the stars.
We were accompanied on our game drives by Mr Solomons the naturalist. It was an exciting and a great experience. We were delighted to see so many elephants, a wide variety of birds and reptiles not forgetting a few large crocodiles. Mr Solomons knew exactly where to find them and parted with a great deal of information presenting it in fascinating detail. There was so much to see and thanks to Mr Solomons we were able to understand and appreciate the jungle and its ecosystems. He has a vast wealth of knowledge and experience which was very apparent. A true gentleman and an absolute genius.

We organized our safari and transfer to Colombo with Mahoora and chose the half-board option.

Our breakfast was packed for our safaris, and be aware that lunch is included even with the half-board option if you decide to go on a full-day safari. All the packed food is tasty, well-prepared, and provided in generous portions (perhaps even a bit too much!).

For our safaris, we decided to have a Naturalist escort, which was absolutely fantastic as it greatly helps in identifying the many bird species you can see. We want to thank Solomons for his sharp eye, extensive knowledge, and passion for sharing his expertise. On our last morning, we decided to switch our morning safari session for a visit to the Elephant Rescue Center, which is a nice add-on to consider during your trip. Once again, Mahoora was great in helping us arrange this. The resort also offers day and night walks, but after a long safari, you might just prefer to rest.

Dinners were tasty, the service was excellent, and the food was once again served in generous portions. As stated on the website, be aware that beverages are not included (except for water).

Lastly, the tent was very nicely set up. Of course, you can't expect the same level of comfort as in a hotel, but our stay was lovely. Each tent is equipped with a fan and a private bathroom. Be aware that insects and small animals may enter the tent. There is a protective net, but you have to use it properly.

The only downside was that the Wi-Fi was out of service.

The best part was the romantic atmosphere gazing at the stars, listening in the night, being surrounded by stunning nature, birds and wildlife. The next morning, after a tasty freshly cooked breakfast, Solomon gave us a walking tour of nature surrounding the camp and the gorgeous lake nearby.He is an experienced and personable guide who is very passionate about nature and can spot birds and small animals from 500 meters. His story telling and knowledge about Sri Lanka flora and fauna is very extensive. He showed us native birds and a chameleon that we could not see without the binoculars. We encountered the famous red back woodpecker, the giant squirrels, monitor lizards, wild rabbit and numerous beautiful water birds at the lake. We came across the traces of the elephants who pass around the camp during the night to get to the water in the lake. We learnt so much from Solomon and are so grateful for his informative tour and friendly service. 
We strongly recommend the Mahoora Tented Safari Camp to those visiting the Udawalawe National Park and would like to express our special thanks to Solomon and the team.","Adventurous Stay at the Mahoora tented Safari Camp Udawalawe","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r995985531-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We opted for full board and the meals were multiple courses with delicious local flavours and produce. 
A few things to note: the location is fairly remote, so having full board is the most sensible option. There were also no specific kids meals, although my son ate a lot of what was on offer.

Yes there are beds etc - but the rooms are dark and it just doesn’t feel fancy if that’s what you’re looking for.

Still - the staff was absolutely superb. Santoosh in particular - our point person and host and especially our absolutely fantastic naturalist guide for all three safaris we took during our three night stay - Heshan. We had been looking forward to Solomon- who has been called out here on Trip Advisor as being an excellent guide - but we happened to arrive while he was away on holiday. Santoosh assured us that we would be well taken care of and we were. Heshan was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, tuned in, and organized. He made every safari unique with his awareness of all the nooks and crannies of the park. He was great company. We saw more elephants and birds than we can count and learned so much about their habits.

After a mediocre first meal upon arrival, the food was excellent and so was service. The campgrounds are lovely and waking up to birdsong is a special special thing.","Superb with a slight need to adjust expectations.","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r987078305-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

The first time, he noticed I was having trouble with a last-minute change in my itinerary and took it upon himself to help coordinate everything quickly and efficiently—saving me a lot of stress. Then again, later in my stay, he went the extra mile by assisting with a special request that most would have considered outside their scope. He handled everything with a warm, professional attitude that made me feel genuinely valued as a guest.

Samantha is a standout example of what great hospitality looks like.

This was our second time staying at the Birds Resort and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The front desk staff, Sakuni, Chamaya, Shenali, and Nizam, has more than excellent customer service. From our first booking phone call until our last goodbye, we were treated as family and welcomed us with open arms. Plus, they used technology very well to confirm our reservation. 

The restaurant area is beautifully designed and feels open, not crowded. The kitchen takes a bit longer to prepare the food, but it is absolutely delicious, fresh, and the chefs use care to plate the food in an appealing way. When enough guests are staying, there is an opportunity for a buffet. There are many varieties of food, both Sri Lankan and Western options. My husband had the best Sri Lankan style omelet from the live food station and wants to compliment the chef! Again, the restaurant staff make everything wonderful. Rashini is working so hard and her customer care makes you feel right at home. Dislshan is running a great team and he makes sure that his customers are well taken care of. 

The rooms are big, open, and so incredibly comfortable. You feel so luxurious with a  huge bathroom and all the amenities that you need. Mr. Sameera, the housekeeping manager made sure our room was perfect before we arrived and provided individualized care for our family. He and his team really know how to take care of their guests. 

Overall, we love this resort because it feels so relaxing and you don't feel like you have to worry about anything, the staff really takes care of you, and it's not crowded. A big thank you to the staff for welcoming our family back again.","The staff make this resort a must stay!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r1003418385-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The pool is absolutely gorgeous, superbly warm water and very long with a kids pool built in. The rooms are spacious, and you can drive your vehicle to park right beside your room. Room decor is a bit dated and could use an update. The treehouse was a big attraction for the kids but not suitable to be climbed due to being too high and the steps being too far apart. 

The food choices are a bit limited, and restaurant staff seem to be freshers in need of a lot of training. Absolutely love the decor and layout of the dining area though, it is truly a masterpiece! 

Special thanks to the best girls Ishara, Dulanji and the rest of the front office staff for going out of the way to make our stay comfortable! I had a terrible headache the night we checked in and Ishara went out of the way to get me the painkillers I requested, very late in the night.

The Birds Resort seemed a perfect location from which to visit Bundala and Udawalawe National Parks. It's situated in the peaceful countryside with large and comfortable modern rooms fronting a lake. The adjacent Bird Park is an added attraction (free to hotel guests), but there was plenty of birdlife in the gardens. For me the main draw was the chance to feed their tame elephants every evening on the reception steps! 
The food in the restaurant is mainly geared up for Sri Lankan or other Asian guests, but they offered both Eastern and Western menus. Choice was limited and you had to order your dinner at breakfast due to low occupancy at the time of our visit. But we did experience one buffet which had plenty of choice of both kinds. The standard of both types of food was excellent. One snag we hit was that the hotel currently has no liquor licence, despite the fact that it has a large bar area, and indeed advertised sundowners on its own website. They could sell beer (and provide to the room mini bar). We brought in and consumed wine from outside, with their permission, to overcome this, but it was unexpected and hopefully only temporary.
Special mention must go to the lovely reception and wait staff, the former being as helpful and informative as any I've ever come across (including picking up on the fact that we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary); the latter being cheerful and super-efficient despite there being a bit of a language problem. 
We had a restful and very pleasant time here, getting away from it all and relaxing around the pool after our early morning starts. You would definitely need your own driver like us, or other transport, as it is quite isolated. Our travel agent took a bit of a risk in booking this for us as they had not used it before, and they weren't really geared up to accommodate our driver as in the other hotels we visited, but we think that if you want a relaxing and peaceful base without all the usual luxury trimmings, the room, pool and grounds are perfectly good enough. Pity about the alcohol licence though!","Nature at its best","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r984780502-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is nestled in nature, with beautiful greenery all around and an open layout that makes it easy to unwind. It’s the perfect place if you’re looking for a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle.

The rooms are incredibly spacious, well-designed, and offer stunning views of the surrounding environment. We loved waking up to the sight of nature right outside our window. The open areas around the resort are great for activities, whether you're into walking, relaxing, or simply enjoying the fresh air.

The pool was another highlight for us—clean, well-maintained, and a lovely spot to cool off and relax after a warm day.

What made our stay even more special were some unique experiences the resort offers. There are several Harley Davidson bikes on-site, perfect for capturing cool photos. Plus, there’s a friendly elephant you can feed and take pictures with, which made for a memorable experience!

While the food may not be five-star level, it’s still delicious and offers great value for money. It’s clear they put care into the meals, and we enjoyed what was served.

The staff was incredibly friendly, flexible, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a pleasant stay.

Overall, Birds Resort is a perfect getaway for nature lovers, offering a serene, spacious, and comfortable environment with a few fun, unique touches. It may not have all the luxury bells and whistles, but it's fantastic for anyone seeking relaxation, peace, and value for money.

The room was spacious, clean, and extremely comfortable, perfect for a family stay. The environment is serene, surrounded by lush greenery, which adds to the peaceful and quiet atmosphere. One of the highlights was waking up to the sight of lovely hens, peacocks, and various birds around the resort, especially during the morning and evening hours. The large pool was a big hit with the kids, offering plenty of space to relax and have fun.

The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the waiters at the restaurant were particularly attentive, doing their best to meet all our requests. However, it seemed that the restaurant was a bit understaffed during the long weekend, leading to some hiccups. Unfortunately, the dessert options were depleted an hour before the buffet ended, and despite requesting a refill, only a couple of frozen cake slices were replenished. This was a disappointment, especially for our children, who were looking forward to dessert. As a result, we made sure to arrive at the buffet as soon as it started on subsequent days.

Another small issue was the lack of complimentary water bottles upon request. Most hotels we've visited offer this service, and it would have been appreciated here as well. Additionally, there was a broken tile in the swimming pool, which caused a minor cut on my husband's foot. Although the lifeguard was aware of the issue, there was no warning sign or visible mark to alert guests, which should be addressed promptly.

While the staff, including chefs, waiters, housekeeping, and receptionists, were helpful, we didn't notice anyone in a managerial role during our stay. We also visited the bird park, which was easily accessible from the resort. However, the buggy cart rental for 5,000 LKR felt unnecessary, as the park is small enough to explore on foot.

Despite these minor issues, we enjoyed our time at Bird Resort Hambantota and would recommend it for families looking for a peaceful getaway. The friendly staff, beautiful environment, and comfortable accommodations made it a memorable stay.","Peaceful Stay with a Few Minor Hiccups","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r967141014-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The room ideal - large, balcony, great shower, and comfortable.  The air conditioning had a mind of its own - probably some settings that kicked in during the night  - but worked well otherwise.  Internet was spotty, but worked for our needs ( why be online when in this place?).  
There is a train that goes by regularly, but mostly during rush hours and not during the night.  Food was very good; nice variety.  Breakfast buffet was smaller than some other places, but there is a menu to order eggs, pancakes. French toast, etc  so no one went hungry.  Sri Lankan breakfast available as preorder - same as other places.  The grounds are beautiful - great pool big enough to do laps.  Then you also cross the RR tracked to go down to a stunning private beach.  We basically used this as our R&R to wind down and didn’t participate in the activities.

Nice touch : I was particularly impressed by the iced water being brought to the sun loungers.

A few negatives points which could easily be resolved :
Lack of sun loungers compared to the number of rooms.
Despite the breakfast area being huge, for some reason the tables are cramped together.
In the common areas, the soft furnishings could do with a refresh.","Worth going back to","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r990558046-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We cannot put into words how perfect this venue was for our wedding. 
We used different parts of the complex for different parts of the wedding which gave each part a different unique experience. The outdoor space was spacious and very well kept. To walk over the train tracks to get to the beach gave an authentic feel to the whole thing. 

All the rooms very amazing. They were constantly kept clean, water bottles and filtered water available throughout the property. Great menu options from Sri Lankan dishes to western dishes. 

The beach is also very beautiful and generally quiet. It’s perfect for our beach ceremony. 
 
Staff were so attentive and went the extra mile for us and every guest. Everything they did was with a smile which just made everyone feel so welcome. Big shout out to Mr Ruwan, any questions regarding food and drinks he will resolve. Always available and will do his best to make everything perfect for you. 

Mr Kalpa has been fantastic during the planning process, no question was too small and no question went unanswered. Nothing was a problem and he catered to unexpected situations on the day such as changing last minute meals to allowing us to have an unexpected pool party. 

In short if you’re deciding to stay here, have an event here or even a wedding.

La piscina è bella, circondata dal giardino tropicale, perfetta per rinfrescarsi dopo una giornata di escursioni.

Colazione e cena a buffet molto buone, con piatti locali e internazionali. Il personale è stato gentilissimo, sempre sorridente e disponibile.

Few hiccups with AC maintanence from the pool suite but Tharindi from the Hotel addressed any concerns immediately and even offered to change our suite rooms. Issue was only for one of the two rooms we booked which was the pool suite so the ocean facing room was great. Regardless as mentioned they addressed any concerns and took care of our needs especially with having young children so overall happy with the experience. Breakfast spread was pretty great and quite delicious. 2nd visit to Kids Club and Spa and as expected service was great.

Our trip was last minute and the only room available for our dates turned out to be the hotel’s largest suite - Red Spot– named after a butterfly so we had no idea when we reserved that this meant our room included a huge wrap around terrace for our exlusive use – complete with couch, enormous floor space and a dining table which Chamee set up for private candlelit dinners overlooking a garden. Need a yoga mat? No problem. Drinks on the terrace at sunset? Of course. With the expert advice of the hotel’s manager, we hired an excellent tuk tuk driver to drive us to the Temple of the Tooth about 20 minutes away. The driver protected us from the touts and made sure we did not get lost. The hotel’s manager also helped us hire the perfect driver to take us on our long drive from Polannawaru to Kandy. We liked the driver so much, we hired him to stay with us for the rest of our trip!  Kandy House is not inexpensive.

We are very sorry about the trouble, but the two gentlemen(as part of your booking) in the affected room told our staff they did not want to move to another room, I hope there was not a misunderstanding, and we are sorry you feel we did not handle the situation well.

Thank you for your comments about the food, views and ambience.It's worth also mentioning that the bottom of the pool is and was not dirty - it is a cement finish, and aesthetically intended to have a more mottled appearance.As you say, the water was clean, the pool is consistently maintained daily.

The rooms are spacious and you have a veranda for each room to relax on. You have your own butler (very pleasant) who was sometimes a little too attentive for our liking. 
We were also surprised that other than the shampoo/shower gel in the bathroom we didn’t have any of the usual sundries like shower cap etc. 

We were there in a torrential downpour which lasted most of the late afternoon and evening. The roof over our son’s bed leaked quite badly and they had to move the bed to prevent it totally saturating the it. Another room had 6 different leaks and that couple eventually were given another room. We felt they didn’t handle our situation particularly well. It took a while for them to check the room and maybe we should have been offered another room given the leak. The place wasn’t full. 

The food is delicious and it’s served outside on the covered veranda in a pleasant environment. Because of the rain we had to have drinks inside which again is in a lovely setting. We did think the food was slightly more expensive here than other places we stayed in.

We do have one criticism and that is the surprise of the bill at the end. We booked Bed and Breakfast and took advantage of the set dinner menu, with drinks on top of that and then extras the bill was the same cost as one night B&B. When we looked closer at the bill it turned out what we thought were complimentary items (for example cashew nuts in a bowl that came with drinks) were in fact $8, they were brought to us with drinks and without asking so we assumed like with most places they were complimentary and when asked if we wanted some more said yes…there is nowhere it states a price for them and the staff didn’t mention a cost so $16 for nuts was frankly a shock!

Pro Tips for fellow travellers :
1. This hotel is not situated in the center of the town so please be mindful of the requests that you make to the staff. It may not be easy for them to cater to any on-demand requests like specific food choices/preferences. Please inform them before hand instead so they can let you know on the possibility. 

2. Food is cooked well so a full meal package or one with breakfast should work well. 

3. Sri-Lanka is going through a turbulent time this year so please do not waste food or resources like electricity or water as these are extremely precious for the country.

We stayed for three nights in one of the modern electric blue beehive rooms. The views from the balcony were spectacular, but the room’s design had some frustrating flaws. For example, the bedside reading light switch was inconveniently placed, requiring you to get out of bed to turn it off. Similarly, reaching the toilet paper from the seat was awkwardly difficult.

I had expected scenic hill paths for pre-dinner strolls, but unfortunately, the surroundings don’t offer much in that regard. Additionally, be prepared for long drives—most tourist attractions are at least one to two hours away by car each way.

That said, as with all six hotels we stayed at in southern Sri Lanka, the staff were warm, gentle, and often proactive in their service.","A hotel in midst of expansion","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r993827443-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

From the first reveal from reception to our last sunrise vista from our Bee Hive, we were wowed by the breathtaking views which reach beyond the Lake in Udawalawa, from where I am now writing this review. We experienced almost every type of weather over the four days and even when it was pouring with rain the view was stunning.

We really enjoyed the traditional welcome, and the Bee Hive cabanas with our private views. As I’d expected from the advert they are a bit querky  but very comfortable with everything you need & the views are amazing.

Service and food at the restaurant, where we ate a lot were very high and all of the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed our local gin & tonics at the bar before dinner.

Our four nights allowed us some downtime after a busy trip but there are interesting places to visit like the Dambatenne Tea Factory, Lipton’s Seat and Bambarakanda waterfall.","The Widest Views of Sri Lanka from a Bee Hive.","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r990743757-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

It was 100% a wonderful stay!

From service, to location, to food everything was on point. I think it was definitely one of the best experiences I’ve had in Sri Lanka.

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. They were always ensuring our stay was absolutely pleasant which I have not experienced in any other hotel. Food was really really yum and the portion sizes were so filling. For each meal I was extremely full that I could go into a food coma. Thinking about it makes me hungry. The rooms were very comfortable and each room had a beautiful view of the mountains and lakes for miles and miles. 

It’s definitely the place to getaway from the hustle and bustle, for peace and tranquility. I hope I get the opportunity to return Dream Cliff Mountain Resort again and will be recommending this place to all my friends and family.","Definitely A Dream Stay","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r952678433-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

The resort itself is gorgeous, huge spacious grounds with a beautiful garden. If you want to calm & relax yourself from a hectic fast paced life, this is definitely the place to be. Nice architectural design. 
You will be surprised once you walk in the morning Peacock and Guineafowls and some beautiful birds can see everywhere in the garden and can experience chirps of birds, you will realize it’s not simple sound. 
 What’s not to love about this stunning property? 
If you’re stay with a group can play basketball, tennis, badminton and cricket 
Everything from front desk to the rooms were well organized and well maintained. The staff were friendly and helpful. Nushan, Ishara, they make sure you are all set and comfortable with your stay.
We were very happy with our stay. Our room was fine and very clean.

Meals were excellent, with a great choice. Dining was fine, Lahiru, Gayathri, Dilshan doing their job exceed the expectation
Another wonderful thing that you can experience is can view different types of birds in the world in the largest birds park in south Asia too.
 beautiful, dangerous, birds
Excellent place to stay. Will definitely stay here again and is highly recommended.","WOW, Birds Park resort a truly wonderful experience","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r945903748-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is very spacious, spread over a large area with plenty of greenery. Guinea fowl and peacocks freely roam around. There’s a basketball court, tennis and badminton courts and a cricket pitch with the relevant equipment for the use of guests which I thought was brilliant! 

The rooms are spacious and comfortable, however it really baffles me why there are no lake-facing patios in some of the deluxe and superior rooms which are in  prime lakefront locations.

Service is 100%! Our AC stopped cooling on Christmas Eve and they had the condenser replaced and room cooled by the time we were back from dinner, which was just outstanding to me considering the service I’d have received from popular hotel chains in SL for a similar issue! Restaurant staff was also very sweet, they brought items from the kitchen which were not on the menu when we inquired about them, and kindly served my 4yo copious bowls of ice cream and fruit while we ate!

Food could be improved for sure, there were no live stations for breakfast even on Christmas day which was surprising. The chef sure does a killer mutton biriyani though! We had buffets for all meals since the hotel was at full occupancy that weekend. 

Definitely would visit again.","Excellent views and stellar service","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r933364045-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

At first sight we thought  it was just another International - style modern hotel, of the type you can find anywhere in the world, but we were mistaken! 

What sets it apart are the restaurant food (some of the best I have had anywhere in the last few years) but most importantly the staff. From the welcome at the front desk, to service in the main restaurant and the rooftop bar, everybody we dealt with was outstanding; friendly, professional, and thoughtful. A particular mention must go to Vimukthi, Manisha and Asitha for their friendliness and professional service in the restaurant, and also to the chef, whose name I don't know, and the kitchen staff, for preparing such excellent food, beautifully presented and cooked perfectly. 

Our room was lovely, on the 8th floor so offering a good view over the city, and very comfortable.

A perfect end to what has been a fantastic trip to this lovely country.

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused at the rooftop resto-bar ward7.

I am very confident that this was a misunderstanding, as we welcome families all the time to the resto-bar. I am myself a father of a young child, I ensure that the resto-bar always maintains a child friendly atmosphere. 

I have taken this matter very seriously with the Food and beverage team to ensure that no family feels the way you have felt. We have spent time training and refreshing the entire team regarding maintaining the right attitude towards families with children. 

Once again please accept my sincere apologies and do not let this one-time occurrence keep you and your kids away from the beautiful resto-bar located at the roof top.

We got the vibe when we arrived there for drinks that they didn’t welcome the children upstairs. Regardless, we stayed for food and drinks but nobody was really very friendly or approachable.

La chambre est superbe, avec une vue dégagée, sans vis à vis. Baies vitrées lumineuses. La piscine en roof top est un peu petite, la terrasse aussi. On aimerait des transats pour faire la sieste. Après 15h30, l'ombre manque aussi! Ce sera notre seule vraie critique! La restauration est, comme souvent chez jetwing, de très haut niveau. Le filet de bar cuit sur peau associé aux petits légumes que j'ai commandé hier aurait eu sa place dans un restaurant avec étoiles MICHELIN en France: absolument sublime!

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We are delighted to hear that you found the staff to be lovely and they went way beyond on your expectations. 

With regard to the food pricing, unfortunately the previous government of Sri Lanka had imposed a tax on tax system which has made the food pricing on the higher side. However with the new government we expect this tax on tax system to be on a lower rate, which will have a direct positive impact on food pricing.

Thank you again for your feedback and looking forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

The tents themselves are a very interesting design, having a living space and a separate sleeping area with a toilet and shower behind. Luxurious by camping standards but obviously not the same as a hotel. The beds are hard and the showers were cold but that’s not the reason you are staying here.

The staff were super attentive, extremely polite and available whenever you needed. They brought multiple courses for every meal, catering specifically for our 3 year old daughter and making sure our needs were met. The food was tasty and fresh and the outdoor dining experience again was very unique.

We had 4 safari’s with the wonderful Solomons, this gentleman was the 49th licensed naturalist in Sri Lanka (for birds) and he was a gold mine of information, telling us so many facts about the local wildlife and animals further afield. In addition to this, he was an excellent spotter, finding pretty much everything other than the illusive leopard which to be fair, isn’t really something you see at Udawalawe.

The campsite itself also had an array of animals, including peacocks, lizards, birds and land monitors.

Our tent had quite a few visitors (bugs and salamanders) but the team came to safely capture them and release outside the tent so we could sleep in peace. There were a number of gaps in the netting, but again once we had pointed these out, the team had them all stitched up before we stayed for our second night. 

The safari itself, we were lucky and saw around 20 elephants in a day, including lots of baby elephants which was really special. The elephants are friendly and not scared by the jeeps but a lot of jeeps will appear quickly if they are sighted.

Dinner in the dark was a magical place. Our guide Solomon told us it was better to do a morning walk instead of the night walk, because there would be so much more to see. And he was right! 
Solomon has a lot of experience and was able to show and tell us a lot during our trips, because he also went with us on safari. Due to footprints he could tell when the animals were there. He can tell a lot of all different kind of animals, especially about birds. We truly liked the story that explains how smart elephants are. We asked to see some other animals, like crocodiles, which we hadn't seen during other safari's. Solomon knew exactly where to find them. 

During this day with Solomon we learned more than the past two weeks in Sri Lanka and we really had a nice time spending our day with him. This local can tell a lot about the island as well in very good English. 
We definitely recommend spending time with Solomon when you're at Udawalawe!","Amazing stay!","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r970650390-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We visited in July with 2 adults and 3 children all under 10. We decided we wanted to break up our trip considering the national park was approx 2 hours from where we were staying in Weligama.

On arrival we were warmly welcomed by the team. We had booked The Mahoora tents which have more space and better amenities and comfort. For our party of 5, the living area has been converted to allow 3 kids beds, with a master bedroom connected to the compact but fully functioning bathroom with shower, toilet and sink.

We had a freshly prepared lunch before having a sunset walk, followed by a campfire bbq. 

We had an early rise (pre 5am) for our morning safari, but well worth it. Cooler temperatures means more animals to see and a more bearable heat level.

What made our trip really special was our Naturist, Solomon. Full of stories, insights and a seemingly photographic memory of local wildlife, he kept us fully entertained throughout the trip. 

Thoroughly recommended for a true wilderness experience, and a must do if you are in the South of Sri Lanka.","‘Glamping’ in the wilderness with kids","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r961881654-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

We zaten in een soort van huisje, lekker bij het zwembad. Mooi groot zwembad en handdoekenservice.
Alles is keurig netjes onderhouden en vriendelijk personeel.
Uitstekend ontbijt in buffetvorm net als het diner, lunch gebruikte we in de bar, bij alle drie volop keuze.
Jammer dat de bar sluit om 10.00uur, volgende dag toch uurtje langer open gehouden voor ons. Niet veel in de buurt, je kan wel snorkelen, surfen, duiken. Leuke plek voor paar dagen ontspanning.

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Our recent return visit to The Calm Resort & Spa, Pasikudah was a truly unforgettable experience—one that we will treasure and enthusiastically recommend to anyone seeking the ideal combination of luxury, serenity, and authentic Sri Lankan hospitality. Upon our arrival, we were welcomed with the warmest smiles and refreshing juice as welcome drinks, which immediately set a relaxing tone for our getaway. 
The resort is ideally situated along one of the most stunning beaches in Sri Lanka. Coconut trees gently sway in the breeze, and the view of the turquoise ocean is simply captivating—whether you’re in the lobby, lounging by the main pool, or taking in the scenery from your room, the landscape looks like it belongs in a travel magazine. 
We were fortunate enough to stay in a Garden View Pool Access Room, which surpassed all of our expectations. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and impeccably clean, featuring all the amenities we could desire—from cosy bedding and an opulent bathroom to a private terrace with direct pool access. The serene garden atmosphere made it feel like our own personal paradise. What truly distinguishes this resort is its remarkable team. Every staff member—from the front desk to housekeeping, from the restaurant employees to the gardeners—was exceptionally kind, professional, and attentive. Their level of service is unparalleled. 
We were particularly impressed with how well the staff recalled our preferences from a previous stay—it genuinely felt like returning home again and again. 
The dining experience at the resort was another standout feature. The à la carte options, especially the Margherita and vegetarian pizzas, were fantastic—hot, crispy, and bursting with flavour, surpassing many other restaurants we’ve tried across Sri Lanka. The buffet and set menu alternatives also provided a wide array of delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented meals catering to all tastes. Be sure to check out their newly constructed beach bar, situated in a spectacular location on the resort's beach. 
We wholeheartedly recommend sampling the resort’s signature Ceylon Yard (Yara) Tea, which was undoubtedly the finest traditional Ceylon tea we’ve ever had—rich, aromatic, and expertly brewed. 
A heartfelt thank you to Sujeeva and the wonderful team at Calm Pasi, who lead by example and maintain the resort to the highest standards. Their meticulous attention to detail, guest-focused approach, and enthusiasm for creating unforgettable experiences genuinely shine. 
All resort areas, including the pool, garden, and restaurant, are impeccably kept and reflect high levels of cleanliness and hygiene. The ambience throughout the resort is peaceful, welcoming, and perfect for both couples and families seeking relaxation. The Calm Resort & Spa in Pasikudha is the ideal choice. 
We departed feeling relaxed, revitalised, and already dreaming of our next stay. At this resort, we all will be cared for by an extraordinary team passionate about hospitality, surrounded by natural beauty, and provided with world-class service. Kudos to the Team again, see you all again.","The Calm Resort – Outstanding Service with its Scenic splendor of Pasikudha","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d8318744-r1009392818-The_Calm_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, the front office team went out of their way to ensure our rooms were arranged to suit our comfort. We stayed in the garden villas, which offered easy access to both the pool and the beautiful, private beach. The calm waters were perfect for the kids to enjoy jet skiing and other water sports.

In the dining area, we were warmly welcomed and attentively cared for by Dammika, who consistently made us feel at home. Ganesh also provided exceptional service throughout our stay. The buffet offered an impressive variety of dishes, and we especially appreciated the nostalgic touch of “Yard tea” served at breakfast.

It was also a pleasure to meet the General Manager, Sujeewa, whose personal attention ensured we had the best possible experience.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were warm, welcoming, and always ready to help. The check-in process was smooth and fast, and we were pleasantly surprised by the spacious, clean, and well-decorated rooms with a breathtaking ocean view that we couldn't get enough of.

Everything about the hotel was simply perfect. The beach was just steps away, and it was clean, quiet, and ideal for kids to play while we relaxed under the sun. The pool area was also a big hit with our family, with plenty of loungers and a great little bar nearby. We dined at the on-site restaurant both nights, and the food was fresh, flavorful, and reasonably priced.

We loved the peaceful atmosphere, Two days felt way too short we all wished we had booked a longer stay. This place gave us exactly the break we needed, and we’re already talking about coming back for a longer trip.

Le seul petit bémol serait qu'il manque un peu de transats, ce qui peut rendre l'accès à un emplacement privilégié un peu difficile. De plus, il serait agréable d'avoir un service de boissons sur la plage ou autour de la piscine, où l'on pourrait se faire servir directement, plutôt que de devoir se déplacer.
Un grand merci particulier à Nathalie de FRAM, qui a vraiment contribué à rendre notre séjour encore plus merveilleux. Elle a été au petit soin pour nous, toujours disponible et avec une gentillesse remarquable. Grâce à elle, notre expérience a été vraiment exceptionnelle.

We stayed for 4 nights during off season so it was very quiet, felt like we had the place to ourselves. The staff are incredibly attentive, can’t do enough for you and wanting to make sure you have a wonderful time. I didn’t catch everyone’s names but Tharindi especially was fantastic looking after our every need.
My only negative comment comes after I had an accident at the sister hotel the Anantara. We were asked to have our breakfast over there one morning and while walking back to the Avani we stopped to take a photograph over looking the lagoon, my foot fell through the wooden board on the deck and injured my leg. This was very dangerous as the wooden decking was all over the hotel, and similarly around the pool at the Avani. Considering how much rainfall there is at this time of year I feel this was really quite dangerous and could have been so much worse if there were any screws or splinters from the damaged wood.
The problem was fixed immediately and Tharindi and all staff were very good taking care of me. They offered to take me to the doctors and also took me to the spa for a treatment, the therapist also looked at my leg! I would urge the maintenance staff at both properties to keep on top of this situation as it could have resulted in a much worse injury.
However, despite this issue we had a wonderful time and it was a great choice for our holiday.","Lovely hotel in a wonderful peaceful setting","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r1011334907-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Yes, the hotel is located near the railway line, but there is nothing we can do about it!! Luckily since most guests sleep with the windows closed and the air conditioning on, the noise from the trains is greatly reduced - and they do not run all night long! 

I am glad you enjoyed your stay and your upgrade - happy to so when we can.

Villa Bentota is a small residence, with just a handful of beautifully appointed rooms I stayed in one of the suites with a lovely terrace overlooking the gardens and the beach in the distance.  Checking in on a Sunday morning, i was pre warned my room would not be ready as it was occupied (thank you for heads up) but was expecting a massive Sri Lankan welcome which simply did not happen - check in was functional, keys and money.  My room was lovely, huge (triple aspect) and with a great view, lovely bed and sumptuous linens and throws. Huge bathroom with a shower and a bath as well as double sink.  Lovely smell of cinnamon oil gently burning to warn off the bugs.   I would liked to have seen more luxury ameneties, candles, speaker and flowers - charged 1750 rupees for a disposable razor was a bit much.   The room was spotlessly clean, the staff looking after the rooms were really amazing, always on hand to assist working around guest schedule .  Good WIFI both in common areas and a room specific - although it did not work in the breakfast room. Outside of the hotel was spotless, a team of gardeners constantly working on the property as well as at the beach just a short walk across the track.  Small restaurant overlooking gardens, lovely spot with a menu to suit all tastes however i would have liked to have seen more variety and perhaps daily specials or a grill evening - breakfast was underwhelming in terms of choices although  what was offered was of good quality.  Restaurant staff were also great, going above and beyond .   Overall this is a really really lovely property, with fab staff and adequate amenities - personally I would add a few more touches, to take from good to great not only in the rooms but as part of the welcome, and in terms of offering advise on day trips and local attractions.    I will definitely be coming back again, so will not share my room number as I want to keep it free for me 😉","Lovely Oasis of Tranquility and Calm.

Our recent stay at Villa Bentota will stay with us forever. It was one of those places that hit every single high note for what we wanted. It is the embodiment of heritage boutique - the design and architecture by Geoffrey Bawa is unique and delivers interest wherever you turn. 

The service is outstanding. It is clear everyone works as a team and strive to ensure guests are happy and want for nothing. All Villa Bentota personnel were professional, friendly, attentive and efficient. They appeared to take great pride in being employees of the hotel.

Our room, suite 4, was delightful. Roomy, clean, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. We loved our huge balcony overlooking the gardens, coconut palms, and of course, the railway line. Loved the railway line - a real feature!

The food and drinks, and accompanying service, is excellent. Yes, you pay a bit more for the restaurant meals and bar drinks, but everything about Villa Bentota is an experience and the rewards are in the staying there. Breakfast is fresh, great in variety, and prepared to order. My wife is coeliac and was provided with gluten free bread and all meal ingredients were carefully checked before being served. Ruwan and his food and beverage team were wonderful, with incredible attention to detail at all times.

Thank you to the whole team at Villa Bentota. You made for a very memorable stay.

The shop was actually very interesting with local art & handicrafts & we did buy a few souvenirs! Breakfast was delicious & well worth ordering Sri Lankan curry & hoppers the night before. The dinner menu was a little limited but we enjoyed all our meals, especially the curries. We enjoyed the individuality of the hotel & the train running through the bottom of the garden didn’t worry us at all-it was fun to see local people going on their journeys.

We had high expectations for Villa Bentota and were very excited about our 5 night stay, having recently stayed at 3 different boutique style hotel/villas, all with outstanding personal service.  Villa Bentota never quite met our expectations nor the previous service levels that we had received during our trip. 

The property and grounds are stunning, as well  the beach which is just across the train track at the bottom of the gardens. The rooms are lovely and the linens etc. are all of a high quality, including the beds ( we slept well).

The food and beverage is a bit pricey compared with other hotels in Sri Lanka, but comparable to international rates. There were a few things which were more than double the price of other SL hotels we visited.

We found the breakfast and dinner a little disappointing for various reasons given our very high expectations. 

We tended to gravitate towards the beach each day, rather than the pool area. The Villa has two sun beds on a fairly deserted stretch of beach. We did ask the Villa team to put on the sun pads each day, to make things a little more comfortable. The Villa has  a small beach bar that operates for sun downers  from 5pm to 7pm,  again it's quite pricey when compared against the neighbouring properties beach bars. There is no refreshment service on the beach from the villa outside the sundown hours, however there are neighbouring beach bars fairly close that we used during the day.  Like the property the beach is stunning .                                      
 
Service from the Manager was excellent when we asked him for anything, it was dealt with immediately.       
                                                                                         We did experience quite a few small service shortfalls during our stay.

The Villa has enormous potential to be really something special.","Mixed feelings ","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r941386258-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

It has a fascinating history, and maintains a traditional feel with beautiful wooden antique furniture throughout. It's also probably the best smelling hotel in Sri Lanka. There is a natural perfume from the gorgeous plants, fruit trees and flowers in the gardens. 

The service is fantastic - they anticipate your every need. We were even escorted from the pool to our room with an umbrella when it rained one afternoon. And they also kindly helped us with some car trouble. 

The food is fantastic, particularly the curry evening - make sure you're staying for that. It's a sensational introduction to Sri Lankan dishes. The juices and smoothies were also lovely. 

The hotel is a little way from Kandy, so it can feel like quite an effort to venture out in the evenings, particularly if you've been out on day trips. Dinner in the hotel, whilst brilliant is on the expensive side, so if you're staying for a few nights it's worth asking the hotel to organise a tuk tuk to any local restaurant and back - it was extremely easy. 

The Pioneer room is lovely, though we didn't actually use the private patio. It feels very private, off on its own away from the other rooms, but close to the dining area. You can hear breakfast being set up in the morning (but this might be true for all of the rooms) and it is a little dark but it's good for darkness at night, and during the day all the doors and windows can be opened - just be careful of insects. 

The pool is very pretty. Though there is now some building work close by so there is a little bit of noise. But with the swaying palm trees and with a gin & tonic or two, it's easy to ignore.","A must-stay place","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d589885-r832753180-Adigar_s_Manor-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

It’s located a 30 minute drive outside Kandy city centre.  The garden - perfect for evening cocktails affords a beautiful (if restricted) view of the paddy fields.  The hotel manager, Mendis, is warm, jovial and extremely helpful; creating an atmosphere that makes you feel like you’re staying in the home of an old friend rather than a commercial property.  The staff are attentive but special mention goes to Samira whose service is outstanding.  The hotel has  swimming pool (unheated) - and it feels ‘hidden’ among the trees.  The food here is SPECTACULAR and if gastronomy is your thing definitely stay here!  A 3 course meal is about £30 pp.   Every room is significantly different in style and size as this is a converted bungalow so choose you’re room with care.  On the first night we had the ground floor room with a  private  patio.  It was £300 (inc breakfast), so on the pricy side.  The only downside was this: the room was adjacent to the outdoor dining area. On the first night a large party of guests arrived for dinner and were seated outside our room. They made a lot of noise.. However, they were asked to wrap up at midnight - which after we complained - was enforced. Better still, the next night their table was moved away from our front door and the staff were incredibly apologetic.   On the last night we moved to an upstairs room. It was beautiful (and fewer small bugs!). The hot water is provided via a tank in the room so be a little sparing if there are 2 of you!

The staff are friendly and attentive at all hours of the day, and speak excellent English - a particular shout out to Sangeeth and Sonjaya who looked after us very well. 
The only serious downside is the approach to the hotel. The narrow broken road isn't the problem - but the piles of rubbish that line it create depression every time one approaches the hotel. I believe the owners should take responsibility to clean it up regularly and pressurise the authorities to provide bins - at least so one can see that they are trying.","Excellent tranquil hotel close to Galle","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d1477843-r830782841-Tamarind_Hill_by_Asia_Leisure-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Easily hands down the best gin cucumber cocktail we have had in  Sri Lanka - the bar tender is a legend. Hopefully they'll get the full licence again (most places in Sri Lanka are operating on a reduced bar service due to Covid lockdowns etc) and more people will visit what is a bit of a forgotten gem of a place.

The food and service is outstanding - promptness of the room service, the freshness of the menu, the courtesy of the dining staff - we were thoroughly pampered. 

At first, we were slightly taken aback that there was no air conditioning in the rooms - however, 15 minutes into the stay, and one realizes that it's not required at all. 

Any room for improvement - yes, mostly room related - the room decor could be slightly less 'tacky', bathroom slippers would help, pillows are slightly hard, wifi is a bit patchy (a blessing maybe!), geyser can be hotter at times, no closed wardrobes, noises from the bathroom get amplified due to the dome design etc. 

However, all said and done, we would still stay here unquestionably whenever we're in SL next. The positives overwhelmingly overwhelm the few improvement areas.","A glimpse of heaven...","2023-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r943704586-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",

The main draw here is the utterly spectacular view southwards over the rolling hills from the beehive-style rooms. It must be one of the best hotel views in the world !

The room itself (Ruby Beehive) was beautiful, quaint and very private. The bed was the biggest we have ever slept in  , maybe an emperor bed. Bathroom was clean and surprisingly spacious.

The gardens are beautiful and a walk around the grounds should not be missed, being another way to take in that astonishing view. And do make the effort to get up for the sunrise at 5.45 am.

Food was somewhat variable. Breakfasts were consistently fantastic - highlights included Kola Kanda porridge and hoppers with fish curry. Some of the evening dishes also hit the mark including Seer fish in Ambassador sauce, and prawn skewers. Biriani and some of the Western dishes were less impressive, our advice would be to stick to the Sri Lankan options - and avoid the ‘Dream Cliff style’ club sandwich altogether. 

One other issue was a 1980s easy listening playlist on a loop over dinner, which we found somewhat grating. Others may love it.  Get a new playlist please!

Staff were very helpful at all times. Thanks especially to Vips and to all the staff who lugged our cases up the steep steps on departure.

My personal attraction of the hotel is it's aptly branded Ward 7 bar with a small but cosy balcony overlooking the city, particularly the adjoining Hospital Square from which the bar itself draws its theme. 

A particular attraction and one you MUST check out is its unique cocktail menu with signature cocktails made keeping in line with bar's theme - Ward 7.

While being a little pricey one can not complain given the innovative range of cocktails they have. One that stands out from the list and one you MUST try is 'Aneasthaesia', which will privide you with a truly anaesthetizing experience.

I think you could also have your regular cocktails like Blue Margaritas, but do not make the mistake of asking for Bloody Maries, which they do not serve, which I did, probbably to the annoyance of at least one of the two Catholic dudes (whom I thought were friends) that I last went there with. 

Later only I realized that the owners of Jetwing too were Christians and perhaps Bloody Maries are a too sensitive a drink to be served in their establishments. 

Regardless I highly recommend the place. The day I went, the ambience was a little sombre, but given the themes of the bar and the cocktail menu, and the music that complemented, I'd say it's one of the perfect places in Colombo to go chill in the evening, when the sun is setting, with a friend or two.

Cheers!","Get Anesthetized at Ward No 7","2023-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r974631874-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The rooms are super large, tastefully furnished, spacious with excellent linen. Bathrooms are large designed to stay dry devoid of wet floors.
Check in is fast, front office is efficient and the guests can drive up to the chalets or rooms.
Pool is well cared for set in a great location.
Chef is a marvel with tasty cuisine with a wide spread to be chosen from. However, variety in the selection of meats is very limited with a marked absence of beef or pork. The grilled tank giant prawn was delicious. However, being so close to the sea, calamari curry or sea crabs and the presence of beef or pork would have eased the monotony of finding the same menu repeated at lunch and dinner. This might be OK for one night bookings but over several days it is tiresome. But, with such tasty cooking it is well worth.
The marvels of an excellent kitchen can be improved with some Restaurant Service skills given to the Restaurant Team. They need to learn that the essentials of restaurant skills is not clearing tables or laying covers, BUT looking after individual guest's needs.  With such a willing Team I am sure this can be done.
All in all, a super holiday and a tip to any traveler to the South of Sri Lanka, mark this as a ""must stay"" place.

Overall, we had a good experience and would recommend the resort to others.

Please note that this rating is highly subjective.

1/10 - @#$% 
2/10 - Not good at all 
3/10 - Not OK
4/10 - Average 
5/10 - OK
6/10 - Good 
7/10 - Very good 
8/10 - Super
9/10 - Excellent 
10/10 - Extremely excellent

Overall experience: I would rate our overall experience as 8 out of 10. The resort is clean and well-maintained, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The only downside was that the food was a bit limited on weekdays.

Room: The room was spacious and comfortable, with a comfortable bed, a sofa in the room, and a TV with satellite connection and a minibar. The bathroom was also clean and well-equipped. I would rate the room as 8 out of 10.

Staff: The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Sachini and Nushan from the front office. They went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, including arranging a birthday cake and decorations for my wife. I would rate the staff as 9 out of 10.

Food: The food was generally good, although the set menu on weekdays was a bit limited. The cakes and desserts were excellent, though. I would rate the food as 7 out of 10 for meals and 9 out of 10 for cakes and desserts.

Facilities: The resort has a nice pool, a mini basketball court, a large playground, and a badminton court. They also offer elephant feeding in the evening, which my wife and my one-and-a-half-year-old daughter enjoyed a lot. They also offer free entry to the bird park next door, which is Asia's Largest Birds Park with over 180 endemic and exotic birds.

Overall, we had a good experience at Bird Resort, Hambantota. The staff were friendly, the room was comfortable, and the facilities were good. I would recommend the resort to others, especially families with young children who are planning to visit the bird park. Great experience. We will be back again.

Especially, I would like to mention Sachini from the front office. She helped me with everything from the room reservation to my checkout. She even arranged a room decor and cake in the evening to surprise my wife for her birthday. She was very friendly and helpful, and I would definitely recommend her to others.

Tips:

** If you are visiting on a weekday, be aware that the food menu is more limited.

** Get an electric cart to visit the bird park next door. It's a large park with over 180 birds, and it can be a bit tiring to walk around. (The electric cart costs 5000 LKR, but it's worth it for the convenience.)

** Sachini is a great asset to the resort, and she will go out of her way to make your stay enjoyable. Be sure to ask for her help if you need anything.","A Great Place to Visit with Kids","2023-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d23064853-r914356320-Birds_Resort_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Just off the highway, halfway between Yala and Galle. 
Confusing roads due to “Over development”
Well maintained lush garden with variety of rare and stunning trees. 

Reception/Check in/Check out
Smooth and efficient service
Friendly and well-mannered staff, yet bit undertrained
Nice ambiance yet poor selection of music 
No wet towel on reception, just a drink

Rooms/Bathrooms
Spacious, well-planned and well furnished
Adequate amount of bathroom amenities
Can increase number of TV channels available
Do not love the idea of using private vehicles inside the hotel, which may cause problems

Activities and Outdoors 
Can visit bird’s park and feed elephants in the resort
Lot of outdoor activities and space for cricket, basketball etc.

Pool
Nicely maintained pool with kids pool and pictures southern sunset
Can increase number of pool benches, construct a bathroom/Changing room/shower and walking path from accommodation site. 

Restaurant and Food
Cannot comment about the variety as it was very limited occupancy
Quality was satisfactory
Seems there were miscommunications between waiting staff and kitchen
Some cutleries and side plates were not cleaned properly
PLEASE USE CLOTH NAPKINS rather than tissue
Can certainly increase the bread menu
Should mention the friendly restaurant staff that is attentive though they were never trained to work in such a place.

No visit to Sri Lanka, nor, life of a domiciled Sri Lankan, would be complete, without a visit to the exquisite beauty of  “Birds Resort” situated in Hambantota, on the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka.
  Recently our family was blessed by God, to be able to visit and stay at this unbelievably gorgeous property. The lush rolling green acres of land, were beautifully landscaped with Giant uncommon trees, sometimes laden with fruit.
  Maintained with great love, and meticulous care, were innumerably species of birds from around the world, with brilliantly coloured feathers and swans of different hues, gliding gracefully in artistically designed ponds. Open “Buggy Cars” take you through winding well concreted roads, for those who prefer not to walk but yet viewing the animals in their giant cages. 
  The inviting, sparkling pool is another enormous and awesome area of absolute serenity, with dozens of spreading shade trees and sunbeds for relaxing swims, or just peaceful contemplation.
  The crunch point was the interior of the Resort Hotel itself, which makes one gasp with admiration, at the stupendous collection of carefully chosen, priceless antiques, typical of southern Sri Lankan culture of glorious bygone ages. The spacious and tastefully laid out dining area with it’s beautiful collection of antique lamps was another fascinating sight.
  A cluster of inviting, well- planned Chalets, cater to every need for privacy or family vacations, being the very epitome of absolute comfort and scrupulous cleanliness.
  Last but Not in any aspect the least, was the warmth, hospitality and efficiency of the dedicated staff, which spoke volumes for their training, to treat every single guest as royalty. Their kindness and interest in our comfort and well being, was par excellence and is something, we will cherish in our memory always.
  May God’s abundant blessings be upon this amazing, Hambantota “Bird Resort”.

The rooms are large suites with your vehicle parked right outside your room. The rooms were large and well appointed. 

For entertainment, there was a mini basketball court, swimming pool, and a badminton court.  

The food was served in our stay due to low turnout as a set menu. The food was ok. Nothing special. Even so, when the dish was good and we asked for seconds, we were refused and told to buy of the ala carte, although we paid for buffet pricing. Extremely dissapointed in that aspect.

The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, especially Sandaruwan, my daughter’s favorite and Ruwan who helped us with our food choices. Lakahiman also assisted my toddler. 

The food was okay. We tried the curry crab and while the curry taste was good, the crab was so skinny and soft. It was also strangely watery. I’m not a crab expert but coming from Manila, we also have a lot of seafood so this was a bit strange. 

What I really loved about the place is the train that passes every few minutes right by the resort and before the beach. I felt it made the place very unique. The overall effect and the grounds are also very pretty and relaxing. It’s a great place to chill if you don’t mind bugs.","Interesting Resort","2023-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d1637352-r895504308-The_Villa_Bentota_by_KK_Collection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

And then there was the safari… no words!!
We saw so many elephants, of different ages, and a big male one too. We also saw crocs, lots of birds including eagles, water buffalo, spotted deer, wild boar. As a vet by profession I was conscious of some safari experiences not being so ethical but we stuck to the dirt tracks and let the animals pass as they pleased, so they were never harassed.

The staff were excellent, attentive but not intrusive and they took care of us exceptionally well and always with a happy smile. Breakfast and lunch were served amongst the trees. Dinner was also amongst the trees with a camp fire.  The food was absolutely delicious and the presentation of the meals was fabulous. One certainly won’t go hungry as  there as there was too much food, however too good to leave on the plate and I am sure we left heavier than we arrived. Our tent was spacious and included a lounge room, bedroom and ensuite so we were very comfortable  during our stay. Whilst there is no air conditioning we slept well with the large fans provided. The main reason to stay here is to go on safari in Udawalawe National Park.  We love being out in the bush and seeing what nature will provide, large and small, around each and every corner. We were lucky to have Mr. Solomon as our naturalist on board our exclusive jeep for our 4 safaris. His knowledge is exceptional with a passion for wildlife to match.  We learnt so much from Mr. Solomon, not just about wildlife but about Sri Lanka. Mr. Solomon is also the camp manager so he is a very busy man but never to busy to stop for chat when in camp. A truly memorable stay and we were sad to leave, however we will have the memories forever.  Thank you Mr. Solomon, staff and Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Udawalawe for a wonderful stay.","A wonderful Glamping experience in Udawalawe","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r941632788-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

With semi-permanent canvas structures, it looks a bit like a scout camp, without the need to tramp across the field to have a shower or use the toilet.

However, be aware that it gets dark early in Sri Lanka and the lighting is absolutely minimal to get you to your tent. Whilst they give you a wee torch it is very easy to get totally lost on the way to some of the tents and there seems to be no signage. On arrival in the tent do not expect higher levels of lighting as all the finishes except the bedsheets are dark, and the lighting is extremely weak.  It is definitely not a place for those with poor eyesight, and even those with extremely good eyesight could easily crash into the glass-topped table or the dark trunk at the end of the bed. Losing dark coloured clothing or luggage is more or less a given with the dark furnishings and floor coverings and whilst we thought it might be brighter in the morning there was not a great deal of difference due to the opaque dark canvas.","Excellent, but not for those of limited mobility or eyesight.","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g674587-d2615639-r937947276-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Udawalawe-Udawalawe_National_Park.html",

The camp has created a unique and cosy glamping set up complete with a double bed, en suite shower (hot!) and even lamps and electricity. This is all in the middle of nowhere; whilst you sleep to the sound of the jungle and the occasional elephant roars in the distance! We felt at one with nature, but in a safe and pretty luxe (for camping!) environment. 

The safari - with Solomon (HRH The Prince) - was the highlight of our entire fortnight in Sri Lanka. Solomon is a safari veteran - he knew the national park inside out, from the trees to the birds to the hundreds of elephants. He even has a 20 year archive of research to prove it!  We were lucky enough to spend an entire day with him for both a morning and afternoon safari. He was so passionate about the landscape and sharing his knowledge. We were humbled by the time we spent with him and fell in love with the national park. 

You will not go hungry here. Breakfast is a five course affair, as is dinner. The perfect way to end safari trips under the canopy and at night time by candlelight. 

Despite all the luxuries you are still ultimately camping in the wild - torches needed at night etc. So be prepared to embrace this before booking.

Если нужно постоянно куда-то ходить, ездить, бродить, то лучше поискать что-то в городах. Здесь есть вся необходимая инфраструктура для уединения. Огромная береговая линия, большая территория, целый парк для прогулок. Если нужно поесть вне отеля, есть ресторанчики. До города с магазинами ехать 10 минут на тук-туке.
Отлично кормят, разнообразно, обильно, вкусно. Десерты просто бомба, хотя, я не любитель сладкого. Мороженое 4 видов.
Пляж чистый и большой. Рядом другие бухты, поспокойнее, для детей.
Персонал приветливый, реально радеет и старается угодить, максимально внимательный. Номера убирают хорошо. Сервис в номере утром и вечером.
Огромная работа по уходу за территорией. Очень чисто и ухоженно. Много милой живности, гикончики, птички, бурундуки, варанчики.
Минусы.
Собаки на пляже. Они безвредны, но навязчивые. Тянут одежду, обувь, лазают по лежакам. Туристы сами виноваты, потому что подкармливают. Надо что-то с этим делать. Это прям беда.
Сороки. Их много, они каркают.
Для нашей большой компании отель оказался идеальным. Обменивались впечатлениями с другими туристами, видели другие отели. У нас и вкусно, и красиво, и чисто, и заботливо. Мы довольны.
Бар. Коктейли делать не умеют вообще.","Отлично для уединенного отдыха","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r1000015468-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Спасибо Авани  за прекрасный отдых. Отель очень понравился. Все чисто, красиво, ухоженно. У нас был номер с видом на речку. В номере есть чайник, холодильник, утюг(если кого интересует), тапочки, халаты, в ванной - шампунь, кондмционер, гель для душа, зубные щетки, паста, фумитокс. Единственное - если нужен фен, то берите свой. Зде��ь он ну очень слабенький. Ежедневно ставят 2 бутылки воды. Но если нужно ещё - попросите, всегда дадут. Мы брали завтрак-ужин. Питание своеобразное конечно, но голодными не останетесь. Если ждёте рыбу-мясо-креветки, то это не здесь. За-то фрукты и сладости на высоте! Вечером всегда мороженое. Убираются в номере дважды в день. Не знаю зачем надо так часто, но наверное так надо. Вроде пустяк - фигурки из полотенец, но здесь это какое-то Действо! За 12 дней ни одного повтора. Прям ждали уже - что за зверушка будет ждать нас сегодня? Динеш - ты молодец!  Все улыбаются, здороваются, ручки лодочкой - приятно! Купаться в океане можно, но со стороны Анантары. Там мол гасит волны. А с нашей стороны - для отчаянных, очень крутой вход в море и сильные волны. У отелей общая территория, там тоже можно брать полотенца, пользоваться лежаками, купаться в бассейнах. Там на пляже и воду можно брать в пластиковых бутылках. Если на пляже нет, можно брать у бассейна. Не знаю почему в Авани этого нет. Рядом небольшое кафе Рэд Лобстер. Оно единственное в шаговой доступности, но вкусно, все свежее.  Брали рыбу, креветки, том ям, тунца. Порции нормальные, но к любому блюду дают рис - получается прям ну очень много! До супермаркета далеко, нам сказали минут 20 идти - врут! Или спортсмены длинноногие. По жаре вообще тяжко. На тук-туке 1 доллар туда-обратно. Экскурсии конечно далёкие. Мы ездили на 9-арочный мост (1 день) - 3,5 часа туда, а обратно 4 с небольшим, т.к. пошёл дождь и движение, конечно, замедлилось.  В 4 утра уехали - в 10 вечера вернулись.  Но может это нам показалось тяжко, а некоторые любят попутешествовать. В общем отель очень понравился, спасибо всему персоналу за ваш труд и улыбки!","Прекрасный Авани.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d3596388-r999869383-Avani_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

Our first meal was freshly caught Tuna, devine, our next grilled fish and chicken and then they impressed us with the most tasty prawns I have EVER eaten and we enjoyed them so much we asked for them again the next night.
There were only four young male staff members doing everything to take care of us and nothing was too much trouble. They served a delicious breakfast as well.

Thank you for your continued trust and for choosing Taru Villas – Mawella once again. It’s an absolute joy to welcome back returning guests, and we are thrilled to hear that your third stay with us was just as relaxing and memorable as the previous ones.

Mawella’s tranquil setting and nearly private stretch of beach offer a unique escape for those seeking peace and quiet, and we’re so pleased that this continues to be your go-to retreat. We’re delighted that you enjoyed the half-board option, and that our culinary team impressed you with their ambitious and flavourful creations—both at breakfast and dinner.

Your kind words about our attentive team and their attention to detail truly mean a lot to us. It’s our greatest reward to know that every member of the staff contributed to making your stay so comfortable. We’re also glad you appreciated the charm of the rooms in the main villa as well as the ocean-view rooms in the new wing—each thoughtfully designed to reflect the serene beauty of our surroundings.

Thank you once again for your generous recommendation. We look forward to welcoming you back to your favourite resort for many more relaxing stays.

This time we took half board, which we found to be a good choice. The kitchen is ambitious and we were very pleased with the meals. That also goes for the breakfast. 
The service is unbeatable from all in the staff and with great attention to detail.
The rooms in the main hotel are all individual and very comfortable. The three rooms in the new building all have ocean view and are also very comfortable.

Thank you for sharing your delightful experience at Taru Villas Mawella Tangalle. We're pleased that your change of plans led to what became one of the best experiences of your touring holiday.

We're thrilled that you appreciated our small, high-quality hotel setting on our gorgeous beach. It's wonderful that you enjoyed your upgraded room in the historic governor's house, with its plunge pool and sea-facing terrace. The leisurely breakfast service on your private terrace is exactly the kind of relaxed luxury experience we aim to provide.

Your enjoyment of our pool, gardens, and especially the beautiful bay with its fishing boats and palm-fringed backdrop is gratifying. We're glad you took advantage of our body boards to enjoy the waves, even when swimming conditions weren't ideal.

While you chose to dine out at one of the local beach restaurants, we appreciate your confidence that our meals would have been excellent based on your breakfast experience. Your kind words about our attentive yet unobtrusive staff are particularly meaningful to us.

This is small, high quality hotel on a gorgeous beach. The hotel is a mix of rooms in the old governor's house and more modern blocks. We were given an upgrade to a room in the old house, this was huge complete with a small plunge pool and a terrace looking towards the sea, where we were served a wonderful breakfast in the morning and which we were able to take our time over and do it justice. 

There's a decent pool and an adjacent bar/restaurant. The gardens in front of the pool and terrace have a couple of gates onto the beach, which has to be one of the best on the island, a small, pretty bay with fishing boats, a few beachside/on beach restaurants and small hotels/villas behind palm trees.

Waves were too strong to swim in but the hotel had a rack of body boards and we spent a happy hour with a couple of these.

We chose to eat out, one of the beach restaurants (Cocktails), food was excellent but we've no doubt from the breakfast that any meal in the hotel would be excellent.

We are delighted that you enjoyed the spacious master bedroom with its private plunge pool and the serene experience of dining on your veranda, accompanied by the sights and sounds of the Indian Ocean.

It’s also wonderful to hear that you enjoyed our freshly prepared meals, particularly the tropical fruits at their peak ripeness—our chefs take great care in curating the finest local produce for an authentic and flavorful experience.

While Mawella’s beach is breathtakingly beautiful, we do understand the importance of ocean safety, and we always encourage guests to be mindful of the natural currents. We are grateful that you highlighted this aspect for future travelers.

Your evocative description of arriving through the antique door to discover our stunning villa on the curving bay captures the sense of discovery we hope all our guests experience. We're pleased you appreciated both the traditional villa style of our main house and the contrasting modern Miami Beach aesthetic of our additional building.

Your detailed observations about our various accommodations, particularly the magnificent master pool suite with its private courtyard jacuzzi and sea views, will be helpful for future guests. The variety of our dining spaces - from the beachy restaurant to the antique table setting - reflects our desire to offer diverse experiences.

We're particularly touched by your appreciation of our staff. Their dedication to ensuring nothing is ""too much trouble"" is central to our service philosophy.

Your note about the peaceful beach, punctuated only by colorful fishing boats, perfectly describes the tranquil environment we're fortunate to share with our guests.

Thank you again for choosing Taru Villas Mawella Tangalle. We hope to welcome you back to our beautiful retreat in the future.

Down a small track, you enter a beautiful garden through an antique door which opens to reveal a stunningly restored villa on a vast, gently curving bay. 

The beauty of the property is obvious from the moment you step through the door. A large open air sitting and dining area with 3 rooms on one side and the magnificent master pool suite on the other with its own private courtyard jacuzzi pool and huge terrace with sea views. This is the best and most exquisite room. 

There is a building next door which houses several more rooms and in contrast to the traditional villa style of the main house, it has more of a modern Miami Beach style.  2 private villas are also within the grounds. There are 2 pools - one garden pool by the private villa and the other closer to the beach. Meals can either be taken in the bright, beachy restaurant or around the huge antique table in the main building. 

As with all Taru Villa properties, the staff are just delightful and nothing is too much trouble. This is an excellent place to relax and drink in the beauty of the setting. Just along the beach are a couple of places to eat but you will have the beach mostly to yourself except from some colourful fishing boats.

A big thank you to all the lovely staff for making our stay so special.","A Beautiful Retreat","2024-12","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r984729107-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you for your enthusiastic review of Taru Villas Mawella Tangalle. We're delighted that you found our property to be a ""retreat extraordinaire!""

We're pleased that you experienced the same high standards you enjoyed at our sister property in Galle. Your appreciation of our authentic Sri Lankan approach to luxury, rather than a ""western pretentious"" style, is particularly gratifying.

It's wonderful to hear that you enjoyed our beachfront location, private areas, generous lawns, and beautiful spacious rooms. The peaceful atmosphere created by our intimate size of just 7-8 rooms is exactly what we aim to provide.

We're glad you found the balance of tranquility at our property with the option to explore busier spots along the beach. Your description of the beach with its local life - school kids, fishing boats, and just the occasional tourist - captures the authentic charm of our location perfectly.

Your one-word summation - ""Heaven"" - is the highest compliment we could receive.

Thank you once again for choosing Taru Villas Mawella Tangalle. We hope to welcome you back to our slice of heaven in the future.

Whilst we were at the beach for sunset, the house lights were put on and lots of candles made it a lovely welcome back.

Executive Chef Keerthi was outstanding.

The Sri Lankan food was authentic and flavorful, and we even tried innovative creations like a pasta dish with a local twist...impressive both in taste and presentation.

The service matched the food. Dhananjay and the ladies on the service team were incredibly cooperative and made us feel right at home. The front desk staff were just as warm and professional...always ready to help.

The chlorine-free swimming pool deserves a special mention. With a depth of 2.5 meters, it felt like swimming in a natural mountain lake — pure, refreshing, and surrounded by nature.

Rooms were clean, cozy, and well-maintained. The property itself is beautifully kept, with scenic walking trails, gardens, and quiet corners that let you breathe. But the real highlight? The view — absolutely mind-blowing. Waking up to waterfalls and mist-covered mountains is something else.

The property is absolutely beautiful the gardens are well looked after, and the views are nothing short of spectacular. It’s one of those places where you can just sit and take in the scenery for hours.

Our room was spacious and cozy, with a lovely view that made waking up each morning feel extra special.

We went on one of the hikes during our stay, and it was honestly a highlight. The surroundings are stunning, and the trail itself was a great experience peaceful, scenic, and well worth it.

Food wise, there’s room for improvement. It wasn’t bad, and the pricing is reasonable, but the flavors could definitely be better. Hopefully something that gets fine tuned over time.

A big shoutout to Sachith, who was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our stay. He really went out of his way to assist us, and it’s that kind of service that makes a place memorable.

the road leading to the hotel is narrow, and the last kilometer is quite rough, with a lot of potholes. It’s manageable, but better to go in a vehicle with good ground clearance to avoid any trouble, especially if it’s been raining

Leaches are a common sighting so be careful and come prepared. 

Evenings are rainy mostly in the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hunnas Falls Hotel recently became one of my top 10 best hotels to be when I need a rest. This is ideal for someone who’s looking to truly rest. Away from busy life, away from stress, this piece of heaven is one of the greatest harmonies of nature and luxury.

The welcome was so special with the special Aarathi — we felt truly honoured. The welcome drink was also so unique and delicious.

We stayed in a garden view room and the view was to die for. The room was spacious, clean, and modern while preserving the history. You have to mind that this is an old hotel so some things will show the age. But, it has its own character. Everything was provided in the room: tea, coffee, mini fridge, hair dryer, and toiletries.

Food was good, but I felt some of the items were frozen rather than freshly made. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Dhananjaya made all of our meals feel extra special. He’s so professional, warm-hearted, and knows how to make someone feel truly special. Dinner was candle-lit over looking the lake and I will never forget that night.

I hope the hotel feeds those little kitties and doggies who roam around the hotel premises — they add extra life to the already alive natural atmosphere.

In the morning, we took a stroll around the lake and I highly recommend doing that, because it’s something magical.

We also checked out their library, which was very interesting.

All and all, this was a remarkable visit and we will definitely come back.

The staff did a marvellous job keeping everything clean and organised. Nilmini, Dananjaya, and Dilusha helped us from the moment we arrived, and we thank you for that.

See you soon!","Nice getaway from busy life","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r1004628294-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

The breathtaking views from the ON14 Rooftop Bar were absolutely mesmerizing — especially during sunset, which painted the sky with stunning colors and created unforgettable evenings. It’s the kind of beauty that keeps calling you back. What made the experience even more special was the exceptional hospitality from Viraj and Anushka. Their genuine warmth and outstanding service made us feel truly valued as a guest/ Customer. 

Morning started on a high note with a fantastic breakfast spread. The variety and quality of the dishes were impressive — from fresh fruits and baked goods to hot local and international options, everything was delicious and well-presented. The attentive staff made sure guests had everything they needed, creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere to begin the day.

Vi blev mødt med en venlig og imødekommende modtagelse i receptionen, og det var en stor hjælp, at vi fik lov til at tjekke ud senere end normalt, da vores fly først gik om aftenen.

Hotellets tagterrasse med pool er virkelig skøn – perfekt til at slappe af med en fantastisk udsigt. Morgenmaden var fremragende med et stort udvalg og høj kvalitet, især frisk frugt og yoghurt var vores favoritter.

We spent two nights here on our tour of Sri Lanka and had a wonderful time. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a loft room which seemed good, however the bed was upstairs and the toilet was down rather steep stairs which we had concerns about. Prochane the duty manager fully understood this and arranged a different upgrade for us so that we were on one level. We would have been happy with a lower grade room but he went out of his way to honour the upgrade.  Could not fault this. Everything about this hotel was first class from the service, pool, breakfast etc.  It is a delightful oasis in an ideal location in the quirky and charming town of Galle. The only small downside for us was that the evening menu was a bit limited for us and we felt it could have had a few more classic dishes on it.  
We had a brilliant young waiter serving us most of the time, he was cheerful, smiled and had a great sense of humour. Sadly I can't find his his name and he was such a great ambassador for the Galle fort.
Highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay again.","A gem in the old town of Galle","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r1008972494-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This is a wonderful hotel with an excellent location situated right on the beach next to the number 1 voted beach bar, Zephyr. On our first night we visited the Seafood Market at the much larger sister hotel, The Lantern Boutique Hotel. We chose our fresh fish and it was cooked to order. The meal was fairly expensive in comparison but to be fair we did pick the mud crab and giant lagoon prawns (the most expensive items in accordance to their weight.) The quality of the meal was superb and well worth the cost, taxes and service charge (which bumped the price up considerably.) Also to our amazement (as we ate under the stars) a large female turtle walked up the beach near to where we were sat and begun digging a nest in the sand to lay her eggs. What a real treat to see with your own eyes. A once in a lifetime experience to see up close and in its natural environment. Needless to say we didn’t visit any turtle sanctuaries. At our hotel we opted for bed and breakfast as there are so many great options to eat near Mirissa beach and of course next door at Zephyr (where the food is also very good.) The breakfast was fantastic, served with fresh fruit and cakes/toast etc. Then you can chose your main breakfast from the 
a la carte menu. We opted for the eggs (cooked as you like) with bacon and sausage. Chefs were super accommodating and it was the best breakfast which set us up for the day. Our server for the 5 days was Malith Pushpa kumara who was attentive and took great care of us during our stay. Room service was equally amazing. Our rooms were made up daily and we received a call each evening to see if we needed anything extra for our room. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Next time we would book at the Lantern as their sea view rooms have large balconies and at Ubuntu you have a Juliet balcony with sliding doors. The sea is rough so you need to be super careful when taking a dip. The staff had kittens (so to speak when our 12 year old ventured in.) Mirissa beach is a 3 minute drive in a Tuk tuk so no issues with accessing a calmer beach. I hope you enjoy the photos I have shared. Thank you to all the friendly staff at Ubuntu beach villas for making our stay at Marissa a memorable experience. We will be back!","Relaxing, warm and friendly staff in a great location to explore Mirissa","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r1000867845-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

The unspoilt stretch of beach is total paradise. It’s amazingly peaceful and relaxed,  and doesn’t have a hotel feeling. We felt like we were in our own villa with incredible personal service. We barely saw other guests, some days having the entire place to ourselves. The staff were so friendly, genuine and attentive without being over the top. They were very flexible, ordering Tuk Tuks when we needed them, or setting up a table next to the pool one evening as we wanted to eat under the stars! Malaka looked after us 24/7 always with a lovely smile, and nothing was too much to ask. The food was amazing and the menu varied- some dishes being modern an imaginative, others more traditional, and always excellently made with the freshest produce. Our delicious breakfasts were made by Malinda, a chef we couldn’t believe was a young trainee as everything was absolutely perfect. Nuwal kept everything spotlessly clean (the place is literally sparkling) and would go to our room at whatever time suited us best. It’s a quick Tuk Tuk rude into the closest town/ village but we didn’t really want to leave much! The beach is just beautiful and you can walk nearly a kilometre in either direction, seeing just several other people, and feels incredibly safe. The hotel has a few other low key sites tucked away along this stretch (you can walk 100m to the main one to have lunch/dinner/ use facilities if you want more of a restaurant feel). Being there in mid March and having had a a couple of storms, the sea was a bit more rough than normal for this time of year, however, even then you could still swim some days about 100-200 meters along the beach. Anywhere in Sri Lanka you have to be careful due to currents but if you stay close to the shore on a good day you can definitely swim. If you go to visit beaches with shallow waters expect to see lots of other tourists and that it won’t be pristine. The two pools are gorgeous and the perfect temperature. The spa staff are on hand at any time if you want a massage. Nothing bad to say, it’s the perfect place to relax after exploring the rest of the country, and can also be a base to explore the area. We wanted to stay forever!","Perfect paradise!","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r998665618-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

From the moment we arrive we are made to feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble.
We arrange through Dinuka (The manager of the property)  for a Private Masseur to come to the property where our  balcony is used... This is so good.
The Food is as good as any Top Restaurant and each day we are consulted on what we would like and how we would like it cooked.
The entire Staff team are what makes this property so welcoming.
Any trips that you care to go on Dinuka will do his best to arrange safely.

Sirinsadana and Jinaajansa

 Very comfortable bed and it looked gorgeous
  Bathroom was big and plenty of hot water.  It too overlooked the pool and surf.
We ate at Coco because the food was excellent. Service with many smiles

Pool was great.  Very clean and plenty of sunloungers. 2 big day beds on the dining area which again overlooked the pool, gardens and surf.

To be fair it was also by far the most expensive. It was the perfect end to our holiday and we could not fault the hotel, the service and the food. We often avoid eating at hotels preferring to sample more local restaurants, however because we were the only guests ( sadly due to the aftermath of the bombings), the hotel very generously included our breakfasts and dinners in the price of the room. Perhaps this was a reward for not cancelling our booking which was at the pre Easter higher rate to take advantage of the much discounted rate on offer when we stayed. We really appreciated the gesture and it was the only discount or deal anyone offered during our entire visit. The food was sensational, gorgeous fruit platters and the best egg hoppers we had in Sri Lanka. The curry night and seafood platter were also superb. By far the biggest asset of this hotel is its staff. A selection of fine young men for whom nothing was too much trouble. We hope that the tourism industry soon recovers and Coco Tangalla gets the full occupancy it so deserves. 
If you can, splash out for King Coco room. It is well worth the extra expense.","Favourite hotel in Sri Lanka","2019-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d2461848-r690532595-Coco_Tangalla-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The reason this hotel deserves its 5 stars, however, is not due to the accommodation, the pool and garden, or the beach-front location, but the service! The young (all male) team couldn't do enough for us. They cared for the hotel and their guests brilliantly; they really took pride in their jobs! Flower petals and candles on the tables in the restaurant every evening and the ""turn-down"" service is not to be missed! The chef is superb. On our last evening, we were the only guests staying. The chef cooked us a menu of our choice (fantastic food!) and we were treated like VIPs - all very romantic! 
If you don't wish to eat at the hotel every evening, the staff can make recommendations.

It's the most magnificent area, with plenty of shade, but during our stay they had moved chairs to allow you to at least sit, but we were there to relax after a week of nonstop sightseeing in Sri Lanka, so sitting upright in a chair was not the plan.  That said, our room was wonderful with a fabulous bathroom and stunning sea view.   The hotel is fresh and modern and from the marvellous welcome at Reception on arrival to the friendly efficient staff in the Restaurant we loved this hotel.  We opted for the Half Board deal and were delighted with the extensive buffet breakfast, with live cooking stations for eggs & hoppers and fresh juices etc.  Dinner was Table Service (which we loved) chosen from a Menu to suit all tastes each night, beautifully presented by excellent Servers.  We really enjoyed the Bar for pre-dinner drinks with its relaxed atmosphere, floor to ceiling windows and sofa with footstools seating facing out to sea.

It was our first visit, and from the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and outstanding hospitality. The hotel itself is beautiful, offering plenty of activities and things to do, ensuring we were never bored.

The food was absolutely delicious, and to our delight, they surprised us with a romantic candlelight dinner, making our stay even more special. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, with stunning views that allowed us to relax and enjoy a peaceful, calming environment.

The management and reception team were exceptional, always checking in to ensure we were having a great time. A special mention to the hotel manager, the outstanding reception staff, restaurant team, and especially Mr. Wasantha and Mr. Janaka, the front office manager. They not only provided excellent service but also guided us on the best areas of the hotel to explore. Even during checkout, they took care of our needs and gave us a warm and heartfelt farewell.

Thanks to their dedication, our honeymoon was truly enjoyable, memorable, and beautiful.

Not only is it tucked away in the middle of nowhere, far from the hustle of town, but it also offers the perfect blend of nature, luxury, and adventure, all in one package.

I visited this place over the weekend with my colleagues, and the hospitality was outstanding. Mr. Janaka, who handled most of our requests, did a fantastic job ensuring we were comfortable and well taken care of. We originally planned to stay just one night, but honestly, we wished we could have stayed longer.

We arrived just in time for lunch and later went on a bird-watching trek with the help of a local guide. The trek was challenging but exciting, and everyone loved the experience. Dinner was served outdoors by a massive bonfire, where we sang songs under a breathtaking starry sky—truly magical!

As for the food, I’d rate it 6.5/10—a nice mix of Western and Sri Lankan cuisine. Another highlight was the waterfall located just a short walk from the hotel. The cool, refreshing water made for an unforgettable experience.

Though this place is known as a honeymoon destination, I’d say it’s just as perfect for a work getaway. It has everything—adventure, relaxation, and great hospitality. Mr. Janaka and his team were incredibly attentive, making our stay even better.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and refreshing retreat!","A Perfect Blend of Nature, Luxury & Adventure – Highly Recommended!","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r995366431-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Galle Fort Hotel.  We are so sorry to read that you disliked the bed in the Admiral Cheng Ho suite; it is an antique, and clearly we need to invest some more attention in restoring it to its former comfort, so thank you for letting us know.  With regards to the noise from the rooms upstairs, we do ask guests to be mindful, as with a heritage building, there are limitations to what we can do structurally.  Again, however, thank you for letting us know; we will see if there is a way we can insulate the floor of the room to muffle sound filtering through to the rooms below.

That aside, we are thrilled that the food and service met your expectations, and will share your words with the team.

What a beautiful little gem in the heart of the fort, all of the staff were very attentive and friendly.  We ended up having dinner somewhere else in the fort but came back for dessert and a dessert cocktail.  the cocktail bar here is something else, two pages of bespoke inventive cocktails, we tried most of them between us in the two days and one night we were here ;)

We had breakfast and lunch here before checking out and all of the food was delicious and fresh, I had the prawn curry with bread and it was amazing.

The fort itself is very interesting to walk around and offers great views back into the main city and out to sea.","Luxury in the Fort.","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r972361421-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We loved the large and spacious patio, huge lawn and privacy from the rest of the estate. Having a butler was also very convenient. The Kurumba House is perfect for families or for two couples, a point to note is that the rooms are not interconnecting however that wasn’t an issue for us. The rooms and interiors in general are very lovely and well appointed. Mawella beach in front is spectacular, not a surfing beach, but the kids had plenty of fun body boarding and there are free boards on site. 
Food is excellent, breakfast especially was of a high standard. Cocktails were well made. They can also organise tuktuk visits to nearby sights like the Hiriketiya beach or blowhole. 
A few points that would make this place better 
1) food prices are on the high side for the kids menu. For eg a margarita kids pizza cost more than the regular pizza
2) the Sri Lankan food was a tad repetitive due to the accompanying vegetable sides being constant. Maybe this is a feature of the cuisine but more variety would be nice 
3) proactive suggestions from staff regarding best times to visit places would be helpful. For eg: we visited the blowhole and the staff helped organise transport but unfortunately we didn’t know that the timing of our visit coincided with low tide, and hence we couldn’t really enjoy the spectacle at all. These small touches from staff would go the extra mile in making this place even better","Highly recommended","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r942474224-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

Пара маек, шорты и шлепанцы. Средство от москитов и после укусов (это Азия!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Все просто роскошно. Во-первых, роскошный пляж. Чистый, широкий с минимальным количеством людей. Если вы увидите на всей его протяженности (где-то 2-2,5 км) человек 15-20, то это будет вау. Там обычно никого нет, при этом нет ощущения опасности, просто обалденный пляж. Песочек мягкий, нет камней ни на нем, ни в воде. Сама вода прозрачная, чистая. Никаких живностей там тоже нет. На самом пляже пара кафе, можно перекусить морепродуктами, выпить сок. По пляжу очень приятно гулять, особенно перед закатом, Шри Ланка так устроена, что там ходить пешком особенно негде, поэтому возможность пройтись туда и обратно между океаном и зеленью, наслаждаясь невероятными пейзажами -  огромная радость, когда в Европе еще серая зима. Вода в феврале теплая, но плавать не получится, это океан, только прыгать в волнах. У виллы есть свои лежаки, которые каждое утро выставляют на пляж. Во-вторых, роскошная территория виллы. Она стоит отдельно от остального отеля, на территории отеля, но только у этой виллы есть своя территория, никто не приходит. Между домом и калиткой к океану огромный ухоженный газон. Каждое утро садовники его чистят, а вечером он симпатично подсвечивается. Есть и большая беседка в тени огромного дерева, пили там чай регулярно. Территория очень хорошо продумана, есть гамак, лежаки, большой мягкий топчан, шезлонги. При этом большая часть в тени, не чувствуется изнуряющая дневная жара.  В-третьих, роскошная вилла. Дом оформлен с большим вкусом, обе спальни (они раздельные, соединяются через веранду) стильные, с большим двуспальными кроватями. Отличное мягкое белье и подушки. Убираются очень чисто, все свежее. Приятно было, что много мест для хранения. Хотя на Шри Ланке не нужно больше 3 сарафанов и тапочек, все равно все аккуратно разложить удобно. Есть, конечно, кондиционеры, мы старались не включать, но ночью было душно и приходилось. С выдумкой сделана ванная, не привычно, но очень интересно. Вся сантехника новая, все очень и очень достойно. Но жемчужина дома – это веранда. Она огромная, обставленная со вкусом хорошей разнообразной мебелью, а какой с нее вид на двор и океан😊 Там же накрывают еду, ее приносят, ходить никуда не надо, все это очень удобно и красиво. Меню есть постоянное, есть блюда переменные. Я не берусь судить качество еды в ресторане, просто потому что мы в Москве действительно избалованы очень хорошими ресторанами. Не будет справедливым писать, что готовят не вкусно, просто надо посмотреть вокруг, как живут люди на Шри Ланке, а также представить себе, что говяжьи щечки не приготовят здесь, как в Лионе, как минимум, потому что это совсем не их кухня. Все, что готовят традиционное – салаты, суп лакса, карри – это все вкусно очень. Также произвели хорошее впечатление паста с морепродуктами и десерт брауни. Цены в ресторане как в Тоскане, хотя на пляже все стоит в разы дешевле, но мы все же предпочитали есть в отеле, так как очень красивая подача на хорошей посуде и все это на своей веранде. Да, сильно дороже, чем вокруг, но по удовлетворенности от еды, не сравнить. Хорошая коктейльная карта и приятное мороженное. Из описания отеля я не поняла, но по факту за Вами закрепляется сотрудник отеля, в нашем случае это была необыкновенная дама, довольно хорошо говорящая по-английски. Она ухаживала за нами, убиралась, организовывала еду…. В общем, респект максимальный отелю за такой персонал. А даме огромный привет, скучаем, что никто нам так дома не помогает😊 Сервис отменный!  В-четвертных, роскошный бассейн на заднем дворе. Да, свой собственный, чистый, теплый в уютном дворике с лежаками.  Метров 9 в длину, вода прозрачная, сущее наслаждение там купаться вечером. 
В общем, это огромный успех, что для каникул мы выбрали этот отель и именно виллу Kurumba. Шикарный отдых в феврале, благодаря прекрасному климату Шри Ланки и роскошному отелю. Он без сомнения стоит своих денег. 
PS от аэропорта 3 часа, удобно до Мириссы (1 ч), там киты и черепахи, также час в другую сторону до bird watching (максимально рекомендую).
Москитов не заметно, но кто-то ноги покусал, чесались. Лучше с собой захватить.","Kurumba house","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r939867471-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

Getting there is easy and fast, about 3 hrs via expressway from Colombo Airport

The rooms are beautifully appointed (we had the Master Bedroom and Sea View Room - two doubles). The Sea View room is a little small, but we spent minimum time in the room - so that was perfectly OK! (we'd obviously recommend these rooms, as the direct views and access to the beach is a huge plus).

The location is great - the beach is clean and uncrowded. We went in Aug which is off-season, the sea right in front was choppy -  but just one minute away is a gentle and flat slope of beach, wonderful for just hanging around. There were enough folks trying body-surfing, swimming etc - seemed fine (although we did not try all that!).

The food is AMAZING ... Chef Dileep and his team turned out marvels for every meal! From Sri Lankan delights (obviously) to 'Western' food - it was all ""cordon bleu"" standard! One of us was a vegetarian - but that was no problem at all for the kitchen team!

The service was equally fabulous! From manager Gihan to the staff of Donald, Sujeeva and others, they did everything to please. We asked for many different things, but nothing fazed them - they said ""yes"" to it all, with genuine hospitality and smiles.

The most wonderful thing about Taru Villas is that it is not anything like a ""hotel"" stay experience - it is like staying at a friend's house, with everything big and small taken care of with taste, warmth and quality.

The service was excellent, and I have to make a special mention of Donald whose service is nothing short of fantastic.

My wife got dengue fever, and was hospitalised drying our stay. Mister Trevor personally intervened and provided me assistance, witch was needed, since i was travelling with 8 month old baby.
Kitchen staff, especially the trainees were allways there to prepare small special dishes, so my baby could eat(be advised that baby food like meat and vegetables puree are not available in sri lanka, and restourant food is too spicy and salty for babies under 1 year).
Chamond and Trevor got out their way to assist me with everything i neded while i was alone, taking care of baby and sick wife.
I was sick before my wife, and she got sick when i got better, and Mister Trevor and Chamond made my stay as pleasant as humanly possible in those condition.

Mister Trevor especially took atleast one hour of his time each day to sit with me, talk to me, and help me with daily tasks i had, and i dont know if i would managed everything as good as i did if i didn't had assistance.

As someone who worked in service industry at one point of my career, amd with 10 years of experience as an manager in retail, and with my position in Ministry of Culture in Croatia, as  senior geographic information system analyst, i can honestly advise you that those two employees have a great potential to be of use to Radisson group, and i sincerely hope that this review will impact in some way their future, or atleast their paycheck.
I left Sri Lanka with no money (hospital bill took everything from me sadly) but if i had an opportunity, i would handsomely tipped them for their service. I had feeling that they was there not just as ranking officials of Radisson hotel, but as a good human beings, and you dont get that combination of professionalism and humanity in one person.

Sincerely,

Simović Mladen.","Sickation","2025-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5279732-r993775148-Radisson_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

- Really beautiful space and good facilities / rooms. Pool is lovely and you’re literally on the beachfront which is very cool. 

- Location itself is actually pretty perfect in as much as you’re still a cheap, 5 minute tuktuk down to all the bars and restaurants of Mirissa Beach, but far enough away that it still does feel private, remote and secure. Incidentally, there is an awesome beach bar / restaurant (Zephyr) literally next door that you can walk out along the beach to, as well as Lantern (the main hotel) which is a really nice walk along the beach to and has a really nice bar / restaurant / beachfront lounging area.

- We also did a day trip to Galle (easy 60 min drive) and you can also very easily get to Weligama down the coast too.

- Friendly service.

Areas for improvement:

- Reveal really need to be more clear as to how all their properties fit together. I’d suggest that they do this as standard with guests when checking in I.e. take 5-10 mins to explain, or make it clearer on their listings.

- For example, with the exception of breakfast, whilst you can order from a food menu at the villas, they have to go and collect it from the hotel down the road (c. 250m away). The same goes for ordering a beer / cocktail - they don’t have an alcohol licence at the villa, so you can order drinks but they have to run down to the hotel to get it. This isn’t necessarily a problem (and the food is delicious!!) just something we didn’t feel was really explained or made obvious until we asked. Basically, I would class it more as a well-catered AirBnB.

- As above, service really was super friendly, helpful and enthusiastic throughout, but there were a few little bits that could elevate them to a real luxury property (e.g. we had to leave at 7am to catch our flight, but breakfast opens at 7. Considering the cost and that we’d stayed 6 nights, we felt it would have maybe been a nice touch just to accommodate a slightly earlier opening e.g. 6.30am). Also, when we checked in we were basically left alone downstairs for 30 mins without much of a welcome as our room was prepared - again, not a huge issue by any means, but just played more into the feeling of it being a BnB / catered apartment. 

- Given the above, for what we paid in comparison to surrounding places / Sri Lanka generally, if honest we felt value for money wasn’t quite as strong here.

As per one of the other reviews, this place has loads of potential but just needs to tweak a few bits.","Great location / space, but a few tweaks needed","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r930342890-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

While it has been a pleasant experience, this hotel is more commercialised compared to the others we stayed in. The room was very clean with stunning sea views, but sadly lacking in a hairdryer that we had to ask for and wait 15 minutes while it was delivered. The pool area is good and the swim up bar is a very nice touch. The buffet at breakfast and dinner has a fantastic choice, but sadly the hot dishes were not very hot and a bit of a disappointment. Compared to our other hotels the service in the restaurant was average at best. When checking out 2 of the lads at the desk asked for a mention in our review. Sorry but from my point of view, all you really did was take my money for drinks and a meal and I didn’t receive any service from you. Would I praise every checkout assistant whenever I went shopping at the supermarket, I think not.","A nice place to stay","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r1002316287-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

Rooms did indeed have an excellent sea view , so for once that promise did live up to the hype.  Rooms are good, if a little shabbily finished around the edges in bathroom/shower.   Air con works well, good shower. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (we did arrive early), but they had changing rooms to allow us to sit by pool, we spent most of the day in the garden / pool area for the afternoon, very pleasant. Pool has a small swim-up bar. Towels provided.  It didn’t bother us but there were a lot of crows round, I guess if you were there for a few days their call may get on your nerves after a while. Went for a walk on the beach. Great beach, but beach is pretty littered which is a shame. We asked for a-la-carte for dinner, but somehow in communication issues they ended up giving us the buffet which I guess they push as its easier for them. So if you don’t want the buffet, make sure you are understood.  It was pretty good but was a lot of food! Wine is expensive. Staff need to sell amenities a bit more, I didn’t know there was a gym (no-one mentioned it) until we left and we only found the roof-top bar by mistake!   But all in all, a perfect stop for one night at start of tour.","Fine hotel relatively near airport to start tour of Sri Lanka.

The road for arrival is mesmerizing. The garden is also well maintained. Staff is friendly and the service is good. Food selection at the buffet is good being a three star hotel. 
Few Improvements that is better if done, 
1. Upon arrival even though it was mentioned as a king size bed for the suite room we got. We only received two single mattresses attached together.  
We requested to change it to get a better sleeping experience considering our back problems as well but we didnt get a response. 

 2. The bathroom amneties are not upto the standard. We had to call the house keeping to help us with switching from shower to the hand shower. It was either one that we could use considering the knob tightness and each time I had a shower I couldnt get hot water but luckily for once my husband had a hot water shower. When inquired they said keep the water open for sometime to get hot water. We did as told. I once kept it for more than 15 mins but I still didn’t get it. It is also a waste of water and time to keep the water open for so long to get hot water. 

3 There were no tissues or facial serviettes available in the room

4. Only two 500 ml water bottles were provided free of charge for a one night stay. Medically speaking 500ml for 24 hours per person is not enough. Water bottle cost is around Rs. 90. I prefer you provide unlimited water for the guests and try to do the cost cutting from some other section or may be increase the rates of the stay and give water. 

5. Restaurant staff is friendly and very good but they lack the skill of making food on time. Lunch was supposed to be started at 12.30. So we went to the restaurant at 12.30 but the staff was still cleaning the windows and the place was not of any welcoming ambience. Us including the other guests had to just sit and wait past 1 pm to get the appetizer. Initially not even water was served at 12.30. 

The hotel and the location is a truly beutiful place. If these small corrections can be done the stay could have been extra ordinary. Overall we had a good stay at the Hunas Fall Hotel.","Had a good stay","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r987453075-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

Perhaps time stands still in salutation to this natural enclave that cradles this long standing hotel. First as a teenager towing my parents, then with extended family and friends,  as a newly wed on our honeymoon and now with my own kids, escaping to Hunas Falls hotel has become a ritual. 
And this time was no different, we’re spellbound, I for the twentieth time, nature never grows stale. I read some reviews that the hotel looks slightly dated. Hmmm…interesting, perhaps this is my key attraction, not a gripe. I like things the way they are. Yes, perhaps a bit of a paint and nothing else. My Father with severely compromised mobility was with us with my mother, my wife and our kids. My kids are obsessed with the place as well, perhaps it’s in the blood or just that nature nurtures those who crave for it.
My heartfelt gratitude to those who’ve known us over the years and still there, Wasantha, Janaka and Gunasekera. They are like an extended family and they still treat us like such. And my heartfelt gratitude to the waiters who carried my father on a wheelchair up the stairs and back, with smiles. The rooms are impeccable and has everything you need, the WiFi and cable tv are top notch. 
The food was sumptuous. The new Manager Mr. Mushtaque greets us with warmth and a personal handshake. The new addition to the executive staff Maudushika blended in with good vibes and a warm heart. Nostalgia burns deep and relentlessly. 
A minor observation is perhaps the sore need of the hour to fill in the gaping pot holes and cracks on the road over the last few meters to the main entrance. Who knows, perhaps it keeps off those who aren’t committed nature lovers. To the management and owners of HFH, perhaps improving what you have may be all that you need, nature will look after the rest. I cannot wait for my twenty first visit.","Twentieth visit and counting (16-17 Dec 24)","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25235637-d477921-r985558170-Hunas_Falls_Hotel-Wehigala_East_Central_Province.html",

My wife and I recently decided to escape to Sri Lanka for a long weekend and after some research decided that the old fort town of Galle would be great to visit.

We could not have asked for a better place to base ourselves whilst explore the local area and then unwinding in the beautiful pool. We stayed in the Grand Apartment which was heavenly, with separate bath and shower area, a beautiful big 4 poster bed and a separate lounge area. A fantastic room. The hotel is located in the centre of the old fort town and is within easy walking distance of all the activities and sites. Whilst there are a number of good hotels in in area, we high recommend that you book into this hotel and truly enjoy your stay. As mentioned the food prepared and supervised by Chef Roshan is fantastic and if you ask him very nicely, he may even prepare for you his fantastic fish curry. It is not on the official menu, but i am sure that with the right  asking, he would prepare i for you.

We didn't know what to expect, and we had one of the most fantastic experiences I can think of. I always want to find out about how people live and eat in each country, so here we had a great chance to find out. 

It took place in a little hut by a lake, started with a local drink and then we not only  learned about local food  but they showed us how the different meals were made, we could even prepare some ourselves. Then we all ate with our fingers, as it's done here in Sri Lanka.

What can I say, the food was delicious, the people very friendly, especially our host Miss Pramodya Herath was extremely friendly and open. It was a pleasure to join this dinner experience.

Malgré un manque de réactivité sur la communication en amont, celle-ci a été excellente sur place grâce à nos échanges avec Pramodya Herath, très professionnelle et réactive vis-à-vis de nos demandes. Elle a pris à cœur notre satisfaction et nous a donné de très bons conseils tout au long du séjour ainsi que pour la suite. Elle a organisé à merveille nos activités de telle sorte que nous avons pu faire toutes les visites souhaitées à notre rythme tout en gagnant une demi-journée de repos pour profiter de la piscine !

Concernant la chambre : impeccable, propreté irréprochable, moderne, bien équipée (nécessite un adaptateur britannique et non indien, mais qui peut être prêté sur demande), le ménage a été effectué quotidiennement. La literie était très confortable. Pour ceux qui sont gênés par la lumière, un masque de nuit est nécessaire (remarque valable pour tout hôtel au Sri Lanka, aucun de ceux réservés lors de notre voyage n’occulte la lumière, il s’agit donc d’un conseil pour de futurs clients et non d’une critique). Les parties communes sont propres et la piscine très agréable à utiliser. Le spa est en construction, toutefois l’hôtel propose les massages en partenariat avec un hôtel voisin et conseillé par Pramodya, il s’agit du meilleur massage de notre séjour sri-lankais, je recommande. Un petit bémol serait le manque d’isolation phonique entre les chambres et le système de climatisation qui est plus bruyant que la norme, mais globalement le niveau de l’hôtel nous a convaincu de notre choix donc il s’agit d’un point d’amélioration qui ne nous empêchera pas de revenir dans le futur.

Le petit déjeuner est varié et très bon (parfois en buffet, parfois à la carte selon le jour ; choix entre continental et sri-lankais), la cuisine du midi et du soir est excellente : une note spéciale pour le rice&curry, d’une générosité incroyable et tellement bon pour un rapport qualité/prix excellent ! 

Contrairement aux avis notés sur le caractère isolé, nous n’avons pas trouvé cela gênant car dans tous les cas les visites nécessitent un transport qui vient vous chercher à l’hôtel. De plus, il est bien situé dans le triangle culturel ce qui nous a permis de visiter à la fois Sigiriya (les deux rochers pour le lever et coucher de soleil, à une vingtaine de minutes en tuktuk), Dambulla, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa et Hurulu Eco Park. 

L’ensemble du personnel est accueillant et serviable, nous avons fortement apprécié leur professionnalisme et leur discrétion tout en restant réactif.

From arrival, we were blown away with the attentive and kind nature from the staff.
Rivandra, the hotel manager, could not do enough for us throughout our stay. He organised yoga with a yoga guru one morning and surf lessons with a tuk tuk to collect us. All were excellent and would highly recommend (They also have body boards at the hotel which were so much fun to use at the beach on the hotel doorstep) 
The staff are AMAZING. Pasindu was with us most days and he always had a smile on his face whilst looking after us any way he could. 
The head chef, Dileep and his team were fantastic. The food is delicious! Breakfast each morning is beautiful and lots of selection from the menu. We were lucky enough to experience a chef cooking class with Taru, and Dileep took us through every step of the Sri Lankan dishes - we ate them that evening on the beach (magical!!!)
Everything was super positive from the hotel and we were very happy with our stay. 
Our only negative would be the cost of drinks at the hotel … a small lion beer is 5USD and most other places are max 2USD. 
A place next door to Taru called sea dragon has a lovely lady selling coconuts etc for a very good price, and she’s always busy. 
A few extra steps was a place called Halycon which was also lovely for lunch and a drink. 
Overall, I would strongly recommend this hotel due to the staff and their hospitality. They really do make this hotel.

Nothing else to say just that is was a highlight in our two week journey in Sri Lanka and our  best recommendation is that we would like to go back as soon as possible though so far away for us ( France). Not to be missed.
The manager has been very generous with us and many thanks again.","Superb too short stay A must.","2021-11","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r820946086-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

The first two nights they put us in Kurumba house. This house used to be owned by a British lady who then sold it to Taru Villas. A woman worked at that house and now is hired by Taru Villas to take care of it with the villa guests. She is very kind and attentive and made sure my husband and I felt very comfortable. The Kurumba house is nice because it has a full kitchen, a huge lawn space with lounge chairs and tables, a private pool in the back, and private beach access. This was a perfect spot for anyone who is looking for an all-inclusive place to stay. 

Our third night we stayed in the Master bedroom. This room was honestly better than the room in the Kurumba house. If you're looking for more privacy, the Kurumba house is for you. But if you're looking for a nicer room that also has a plunge pool, the Master bedroom was definitely the best. All around, this villa has everything you need for a luxurious stay at a beachfront.

While we were there the ocean was a bit too rough to swim in but it was still beautiful to look at. We also explored down the coastline and found a hidden inlet around the corner.

My husband and I definitely have no regrets staying here for part of our honeymoon. It was beautiful and the staff even gave us a small cake congratulating us for our marriage at the end of our stay! We highly recommend this to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing place to get away!","The Perfect Honeymoon Spot!","2021-08","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r808579993-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

The beach access was ideal and there were only a few bicycles passing now and then and very few people passing through. The food was fantastic - everything we were served was delicious. The staff are so attentive, professional and discrete, considering there is always someone within an earshot to be of assistance.

This was our second Taru Villas property that we had chosen for our trip to Sri Lanka and again we were not disappointed in anyway.  The beach house was beautifully situated seconds away from mawalla beach which is empty and no tourists at all.  The sea was rough but we managed to swim and enjoyed the waves.  We were very well looked after and cared for by the lovely lady who works at the beach house.  We enjoyed lazy breakfasts outside and delicious lunch too on several of the days.  On our last night we had dinner outside in the cabana in the garden which was beautiful listening to the waves under the night sky.  We chose our dinner from a very varied menu and they allowed for changes to this too.  I would definitely highly recommend staying here if you want a peaceful escape and an empty beach on which to relax for a few days and be looked after as though you are staying in somebody private house.  Both bedrooms are the same, well appointed, clean and comfortable with a good shower.  The only thing I would say  is that the bed is not very large, its more of a double/king than a superking.  The bedding is very soft and luxurious as they were in both Taru Villas properties we stayed in.

The beach was very tranquil and we took many walks (there were only 1-2 touts that you had to watch out for). 

There are some improvements that could be made to the service. For example, when I was at the beach chairs, noone came to check if I needed any drinks.  It is unclear if purified water was complimentary outside of the meal hours. You can only pick one main item for breakfast but it wasn't stated on the menu (leading to a slightly awkward conversation).

Situated along the southern coast of the island and the blue green shades of Mawella Bay, this charming boutique hotel has all the makings of an ideal holiday escape. The Resident Manager, Heshan was friendly and took me on a mini tour of the entire property. 

All the rooms within the Taru Villas chain emanate a contemporary yet luxurious vibe. Looming artistic canvas in both colourful and bright, as well as rustic grey tones fill the walls and spaces, along with unique decorative pieces and furnishings. Every item seems to have a purpose and complements one another. They add not just a touch of comfort but also an air of modern tropical charm. 

The food does not disappoint, in terms of presentation, flavour or quantity. There was a generous amount of tiger prawns on the first dish although I wasn’t onboard about the crusted bread. On the second dish, the curry sauce and coconut sambol was served in tiny bowls and I didn’t under the reason for this as the main was a wrap. Regardless, I occasionally dipped into the two condiments between each mouthful and it was delicious. I’d skipped dessert at lunch time so I was adamant to try some at dinner - again opting for two; a chocolate mousse with cashew nuts and salted caramel as well as a serving of espresso ice cream with peanut praline. Both were absolutely divine!

Overall, I had a wonderful stay!","Beachy tropical charm","2019-08","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g26627414-d9591209-r715014879-Taru_Villas_Mawella_Tangalle-Morakatiyara_Southern_Province.html",

Today we had High Tea in the lounge with a lit fireplace warming us on a rainy afternoon. The tea was excellent, many different varieties were offered. There was an abundance of delectable goodies. 
The exceptional experience was the tour by Hashem, one of the major domos of Hill Club.  My family and I vacationed at the Hill Club for a weeks respite from the Colombo heat each year for 4 yrs in the 1950s. Knowing this, Hashem showed me all the rooms that were present at that time period and how changes have been made. He took me to the hallway where I stayed as a child and to the back of the hotel where there had been family escapades with a monkey that got loose. It was a wonderful trip down memory lane.
I returned this week with my family so they could experience a real High Tea in Sri Lanka and they basked in the lovely hotel and the days of yesteryear.","A historic hotel to enjoy","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d447505-r998555551-The_Hill_Club-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Ninety percent of the produce needed is produced in these gardens.

I ended by saying, ""next time we like to stay here"".
And here we are, staying for a week

Being resident, my first impressions were confirmed. This place is truly magical and utterly relaxing.

I noticed two things special:
In the night you find a hot water bottle under your duvet. How cosy;
At 9 am sharp, they have a flag raising ceremony. Everyting stops, national anthem is sung.

Every one is highly trained in customer service.

F &B manager mr maluddeniya and his team look after all your culinary needs, however wierd, as ours are. 
Whilst everyone is helpful, servers kasun and vigneshwaran need special mention - they have a 'memory'.

The rooms were on the small side but then this is a converted house not a custom-built hotel, however a clever little trolley sits under each side of the bed to bring out your suitcases! The pool is almost exclusive with such small room numbers and dining is similarly an intimate affair in an idyllic situation. Although part of a group, this hotel retains a charming intimacy and will repay anyone who wants to feel that they have seen this lovely island without feeling that they might as well be in any holiday destination around the world.

Restaurant service for lunch and dinner as well as beverages in between. So we did not leave for three days... The food is excellent!! This all justifies the price and the high rating. There is one larger room with sea view (highly recommended), the other rooms are rather small without view or sitting area which is no issue if you don’t plan to stay a lot in your room.

The hotel itself is quite small and feels like a Tropical boutique country house hotel with beautiful furnishings, lovely pool, games and cosy atmosphere. 

The beach beyond the garden is breathtaking but you cannot swim unless you walk 10 -15 minutes  to the right, away from town. If you do this take decent shoes, our romantic stroll turned into a rock scramble.

 We were in the 'King coco' room which has its own private balcony and palm tree in the bathroom.  Very romantic and perfect for a honeymoon although you really need to keep the bathroom door shut if you want to avoid mosquitoes at night. 

The food was exceptionally good and the service was attentive and professional. Like many places in Sri Lanka this hotel does not have an alcohol licence but you are given a complimentary bottle of wine with each evening meal.","Beautiful boutique hotel, lovely views and excellent food & service","2018-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d2461848-r617369053-Coco_Tangalla-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

In hindsight, we did not appreciate this hotel enough whilst there. 

It is a brilliantly located hotel, slightly out of the centre, but hogs a lovely beachfront location. The room was spaciously modern, the staff were really friendly and  attentive (seems to be a trait with Heritance staff- see also review about The Tea Factory in Nuwara Eliya!) and the food was really nice as well, with a good mix of western/eastern food. 

For us, who like to have a wander around in the evenings, it was equally well located. The road up past the hotel, was littered with bars restaurant/cafes and shops, which meant that not only can you admire the glorious sunsets over the Indian Ocean, you can go out for a nice little stroll as well.","Superbly situated beachside hotel and slightly away from the centre","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r995979457-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

This hotel is glorious - old world charm with its colonial past still echoing through the rooms, in a good way.  We loved our two nights here.

Our room was very spacious and super clean, with a lovely balcony overlooking the back gardens.  It was quiet and so peaceful, getting out of bed in the mornings was difficult.

The staff were just wonderful - especially the lovely young man in the bar area who kept my friend very happy with a endless bowls of sweet potato chips with our drinks.

The location is fantastic - walking distance into the two, yet so peaceful.  The buffet for dinner and breakfast was fantastic with a huge variety of food on offer. Also plenty of seating with two dining rooms and an outside area if weather permits.

There are also lots of lovely lounge areas - many with fireplaces - to sit and while away some time.  And the fires are needed in the evenings as it can get quite cool.

Our biggest disappointment was having to leave after just two nights - I could have stayed for a month.","Two nights was not enough","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579216-r1009924233-Jetwing_St_Andrew_s-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

In addition to the beautiful rooms, excellent food, and clean facilities, the staff at Ubuntu earn the highest praise. Hasitha ensures smooth operations and seems to appear precisely when hoped for with an answer, a solution or simply a friendly conversation. G. G. Didula’s smiling service is unmatched. I cannot say enough about these two accommodating gentlemen. 

The beach is gorgeous, but the surf is too rough for swimming in front of the hotel. It’s a fair trade for iconic turtle hatches directly in front of the hotel; we magically happened upon a hatch in the middle of the day! There are some small protected bathing areas further down the beach in either direction. Head to Mirissa Beach if you’d like to really swim, surf, shop, and stroll. There are two pools directly in front of the dining and lounging areas which are well maintained and inviting.

The rooms are ample, with high ceilings, sliding glass doors to the sea, twice-daily turn-down service, hot/cold showers, A/C, fridge, comfy seats and lots of open space. The hotel is very quiet and the resident beach dogs common to all such vacation spots are uncommonly sweet. 

Ubuntu has several associated boutique hotels along the beach, and the food service (except for breakfast) comes from down the road. The food is fantastic, and of course the service is great.

This part of Sri Lanka is special because it relatively quiet, clean, and extremely beautiful. Ubuntu is the perfect place to stay on the southern coast.

The last part of our trip was to Mirissa where we spent 4 nights at this hotel. The hotel were very professional from the start with our requests prior to arrival.

We were happy to be given sea view rooms, which were amazing! The rooms were in the adjacent Beach Hut rather than in the main hotel which made it more intimate. The views from the room were amazing and the sound of the sea was so calming.

The rooms were of a great size and definitely the most luxurious out of the hotels we stayed in whilst we were in Sri Lanka. We were greeted with fresh juice and pleasant staff. We were happy with our rooms and everything seemed to be nicely cleaned. We had no major gripes with anything with regards to the rooms or cleanliness. The beds were also really comfy. Wifi was really good and available in the rooms.

The hotel is a bit further away from the main Mirissa beach but you can drive/get a tuk tuk and it does not take too long. You can also walk along the sandy beach which was clean - however beware the waves, the sea is not safe to swim in! The beach was deserted and this made it nice and peaceful. We were a bit disappointed that the hotel could not offer driver accommodation but they only have a small number of rooms. If they could provide this facility in future, it would be very useful for travellers.

The layout of the hotel is nice - be aware there is no lift but the porters help with taking the luggage up. The staff were great, including the cleaner, who was amazing with his towel art!! It was always a surprise to see what new design he had created - absolutely wonderful. We loved the crocodile the best!!!

We had great fun in the pool and the outside lounge area! There were some bugs in the pool but when we asked the staff to clean, they did so promptly. 

As someone who is prone to insect bites, I should just advise that I did receive a fair few mosquito bites in Mirissa and did spot some in the seating area/lobby. 

The restaurant is nice and again has beautiful views, especially in the morning. The breakfast itself was not bad - it is a la carte but is a bit samey for vegetarians, only offering mainly egg options or the Sri Lankan breakfast. We also had dinner one night which was not too bad but again not a lot of options for vegetarians. They have two restaurants offering the same fare - they organise a tuk tuk for you to travel between the two or it is about 10 minutes to walk. 

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and recommend it for anyone coming to Mirissa that is looking for a luxurious, relaxing stay! We felt at home!","Beautiful hotel, with amazing sea views and lovely stay in Mirissa!","2022-05","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r838624451-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

First impression was no welcome. No staff to help with unloading. Rooms were nice, big, and the washrooms were extra large with indoor and outdoor showers. Non of the rooms had floor mats. With sea breeze and sand anyone can understand what a lot of dirt comes in. Finally we asked for some and got few. The sitting and dining areas did not have glass window panels to block rain shower. The first day it was heavy rain and we really couldn't stay in the sitting area and enjoy dinner either. Luckily second day rain was not so heavy we did manage to stay in the restaurant and sitting areas. The other part was the villa did not have a kitchen. Every time we order something they had to bring them from their sister villa which is 50 to 100 meters away. Just imagine if you order a fresh juice the staff had to call and order and the sister hotel staff deliver to the villa. It was time killing. We did order lots of extra food, soups, desserts, beer and many others during our stay but delivery time and system was bit messy. Some times we were feeling odd to order because we were feeling not relaxed because we saw and knew the struggle. An upmarket Villa like this charging higher rates not to have inhouse kitchen is not good. Just imagine even to bring a fruit juice someone must bring it in a vehicle from their sister hotel traveling 50 to 100 meters. The two staff at the villa was just amazing. They tried very hard to provide the services to the best at all times. Those two guys were just superb. They were extra so many miles to do their best services. Even during rainy days both of them tried their best to clean the place many times to provide food for us. Hats-off to both of them. With all that and busy services the two staff even organized a small Aurudu Utsawaya with few games. That was really nice of them. We never requested but it was planned by them. The Manager was very caring and attentive and even offered us 8 pizzas free. Very nice of him. I also noticed even the room cleaning boys were very good. Every single day they cleaned and mopped all rooms. Those services at the villa were excellent. All in all it was a nice stay. Nice Villa. Nice Beach front. Nice two pools. Nice cosy comfy rooms. My only advice is the management to look in to my few concerns and upgrade them soon. Once again my loving regards to both the in-house staff for their excellent-superb-attentive-never say no service.","Very Nice Villa with amazing staff care","2022-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d10149904-r834767550-Ubuntu_Beach_Villas_By_Reveal-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

One critic point is that you have to go to the main hotel for dinner, but the hotel will arrange a Tuk Tuk to take you to the main hotel free.

The balcony looks out onto a really lovely pool. Long enough to swim in and the way it is presented makes for really warm water, even after dark.

The buffet-style food provides enough for both Western tastes and Sri Lankan ones and the separately cheffed area provided interesting delights, including the best Kottu we had on the island.  The people made us extraordinarily welcome and it highlighted just how much Sri Lanka needs the return of greater numbers of Western tourists to support an industry that has been unfairly tainted with the issues of political and economic change last year.

Thank you for choosing The Palms Beruwala and for your lovely feedback. We’re delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay, and we truly appreciate your kind words about Kavindya and Vihara. 

We’re glad you found the hotel beautiful and relaxing. As you may have discovered, Beruwala and the nearby Bentota area offer a wealth of experiences beyond the beach. Many attractions such as water sports and river safaris to historic sites like the temples, local handicrafts, and turtle hatcheries. Whether it’s a scenic walk along the coast or an adventurous boat ride through the mangroves, there’s always something to explore here on Sri Lanka’s stunning south coast.

We hope to welcome you back soon for another memorable stay.

Man sollte wissen  bei Vollmond gibt es keinen Alkohol. Viele Ausflüge , Massagen und einkaufen kann man am Strand bei Sunil. Sehr nett! Die Küche ist sehr gut und eine Gewürzexplosion.
Ach ein Teil wirklich scharf, aber für jeden etwas dabei. Sehr gepflegte Gartenanlage .
Jeden Tag gereinigten Strand.
Super sauberer Pool.
Sehr zahme Streifenhörnchen. Zimmer einfache saubere Ausstattung, neue Bäder, Tresor, keine Bademäntel und Hausschuhe. WiFi bestens im ganzen Objekt.

Отдыхали с мужем в данном отеле. При выборе ориентировались на отзывы: взяли делюкс с видом на реку, номер 127. Саму реку с балкона видно мало, вид на джунгли и храм золотого Будды. Было хорошо, тихо, спокойно. Сам номер не в идеальном, но во вполне хорошем состоянии. Ежедневная чистая уборка с заменой белья, замена расходников по мере их использования (выдают гель, шампунь и мыло), обновление полотенец, пару бутылок воды. Завтраки достаточные для того, чтобы наестся, но без излишеств - сезонные фрукты (ананас, бананы, папайя, лайм, иногда было манго), карри, на выбор блюдо из яиц - омлет/яичница, можно попросить кашу, чай/кофе, сосиски, иногда панкейки. Не остро, если вы не любитель острого - вам зайдет. 
Главный плюс для нас - русские хозяева Светлана и Сергей. Многие сотрудники отеля понимают и говорят на русском языке, любой вопрос сотрудники помогут решить, персонал - супер!
Отель находится на берегу речки, на чистый пляж океана возит на лодочке по времени сотрудник Саман.
Иногда его заменял Манджула - местный лодочник, у него можно попросить вам провести экскурсию по реке, на туктуке 🛺, цены +- как и у всех остальных гидов.
В общем, для спокойного семейного отдыха условий более чем достаточно. Остались довольны!","Лучший спокойный и чистый отель для русских туристов","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d11894777-r992611975-Arena_Hotel-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Отличные номера, высокие потолки, балкон есть везде. Сервис на высшем уровне, пастельное белье и полотенца меняли каждый день, хорошая уборка, везде чистота. Обслуживание отличное, если что-то требовалось все шли на встречу. Очень вкусная кухня, повару респект. В отеле есть бассейн, где приятно можно охладится в обед. Пляж близко общественный, а на дикий пляж возят на лодке в удобное для вас время индивидуально и бесплатно. Мы опытные путешественники и жили в разных отелях и в 3, 4. 5. Но здесь было лучше всего.

Arena Hotel полностью оправдал мои ожидания. Современные чистые номера, потрясающий вид на реку , идеальная уборка (зарядки для телефонов были аккуратно свернуты, вещи разбросанные на кровати сложены) . Удобные матрасы, подушки . Все белоснежное. Полотенца мягкие ,вкусно пахнущие. Каждый день приносили водичку.  

Завтраков нам всегда хватало, и даже было много , яйца в любом виде , каша , блинчики , тосты , фреш и фрукты.

Питались часто в отеле на обед и ужин, можно найти и дешевле, но в отеле все очень устраивало , вкусно , чисто , и главное ни каких проблем за все время с пищеварением не возникло. Очень вкусные креветки гриль . 2 Раза заказывала. Великолепный рис, который можно есть без всего , такой вкусный! Ни одного острого блюда не было ! Специи приносили отдельно и можно самим регулировать остроту.

Локация очень удобная ! Рядом все необходимое . Можно пешком, можно на тук-туке за  100 рублей (российских) туда обратно доехать до нужного места . Есть и пиццерии и KFC  там можно экономнее покушать . Мы даже не брали экскурсии , интересных мест хватило рядом . Храмовый комплекс и сад на территории монастыря. Очень зеленый , местами мистический,почти напротив отеля.
 Маяк, с его восхитительным видом.  Большой Будда Kande Viharaya Temple, рядом с ним слон которого можно покормить-невероятные эмоции , тут же школа монахов. Брали рыбалку, сафари по реке, все прямо от нашего отеля. 

        По поводу пляжей. Огромный жирный плюс что у отеля 2 пляжа!!!  Мы купались на том пляже куда возят на лодке, 5 минут . Он шикарный, уединенный , широкий . Я когда первый раз увидела эту безлюдную красоту, даже прослезилась . Туристы платят чтобы их отвезли на этот пляж , а у нас он включен по умолчанию. Волны есть , но без них было бы скучно , с ребенком не вылезали из океана . Там где камни ,в начале пляжа, не купайтесь  пожалуйста , опасно . Прямо с пляжа по лесенке можно попасть в буддийский монастырь . С него есть выход на скалу к морю. Вид потрясный . 
       Тот пляж  на который можно попасть пешком, примерно 7 минут , показался грязнее. Есть кафешка Махараджа, кушали там-вкусно . Вечером музыка , можно посидеть .

Бассейн маленький, но так как там не много туристов, напряга не было .  Можно купаться вечером .

Всё что я хотела , я получила . Чистый отель, хорошее расположение , вкусное питание и шикарный и самое главное купабельный пляж .","Чистый , уютный , домашний","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d11894777-r984992799-Arena_Hotel-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Отель новый, маленький по этому уютно и уединенно. Номера свежие. Фото номеров соответствуют. Сантехника в идеальном состоянии. Матрасы/подушки - отличные, комфортные, даже доп.кровать у сына вполне была хороша. Кондиционер - хороший, можно отрегулировать и даже спать ночью. Шумоизоляция – отличная, добротные двери, в коридоре палас, хорошие стеклопакеты. Wi-fi - отличный, работает везде, хоть фильмы смотри. Выход к реке с лианами - это прям круть, экзотика! Море рядом (400-500 м). Пляжи разные: можно попрыгать на волнах (Моргала Бич), можно посидеть в спокойной воде (как в ванной) - надо пройти подальше в стороны отеля Palms Hotel повернуть за небольшой мыс, там начинается коралловый риф, который гасит волну. На рифе во время отлива (утром) можно найти морских ежей. На лодке от отеля возят на пляж отеля Club Bentota - людей почти нет, широкий пляж, но почти не обустроен (нет кафе и лежаков). Зато можно сходить в гости к будисту-монаху на холм. Там всякие интересные молильные места и красивый вид со скалы. Только пожалуйста проявляйте уважение к религии и святыням. Вентура бич - хороший пляж, там у мыса сёрф-школа, удачное место для начинающих сёрферов. Можно взять урок с инструктором, можно просто доску в аренду. 
По реке экскурсию обязательно возьмите - крокодилы, обезьяны, вараны и мангровые заросли. Мы также напросились на рыбалку. Ловили прям там же возле отеля с лодки. Просто восторг - огромные рыбины. Договорились, чтобы в ресторане её для нас приготовили. Рыба костлявая, но очень вкусна. Ресторан - дорогой, цены в долларах, 8-16 $ за горячее, можно найти и круче и дешевле. 
Рекомендую местного гида Nil +94 76-437-5848 - говорит по-русски и по-английски. Меня он расположил - не навязчивый, приятный, без выпендрёжа и лишней суеты. Свозил нас на маяк (на острове), сам купил рыбу, сам её там приготовил для нас пока мы плавали с масками и ныряли с острова. Очень классно провели время. Подсказывал нам, где лучше покушать, где поменять валюту, где лучше купить лекарства, косметику, чай, специи и пр. Также свозил нас на маленький водопад. Дети поныряли со скалы, рыбки сделали нам пилинг, по пути полюбовались горами, посмотрели как растет чай и др.специи, все остались довольны. Поскольку у нас не было возможности съездить в глубь острова в горы, то эта поездка была утешительной заменой. 
Рекомендую тук-тукера Suresh +94 77-940-5337. Он видимо начинающий, поэтому цены ооооочень низкие по сравнению с другими и не надо долго торговаться. Он всегда на связи, быстро отвечает в Вотсапе и быстро приезжает, вежлив, скромен, не навязчив. Он свозил нас на черепаховую ферму, по пути завёз в местную столовку позавтракать (дёшево и по-местному). Свозил к слону и золотому будде. Пол дня катались, за всё 2000 рупий (650 руб).
Также мы самостоятельно ездили в Хиккадуву на электричке (40 мин, 100 руб в один конец на чел). Очень даже интересное путешествие получилось. Хотя пляжи там мне не понравились. У нас (в Бентонте) лучше! Ещё много чего посмотрели и попробовали. Впечатлений куча и вам того же желаю!","Отель - отличный. Отдых - отличный.

We opted for one of the less expensive rooms in the main building which was a bit noisy due to the constant traffic on the road. It was decorated in Sri Lankan style and had everything we needed, including AC, kettle and hot shower. The gardens of the property are delightful with a pool where a swim is often watched over by the local wildlife including a troop of monkeys and peacocks The breakfast served here is excellent. 
Across the main road is a path to Turtle beach where a morning visit and a bit of patience provides a special opportunity to see the turtles in the sea- snorkelling equipment available to rent.

At the time we visited they were doing a major renovation of the restaurant areas. 
There is a nice pool and a large well equipped gym. The beach is definitely NOT for swimming or sunbathing (ie. dirty & rough).
The staff, while friendly, are not very pro-active. Eg. lots of guests sitting around the pool & 4 staff standing at the restaurant/bar but none came over to the guests asking if anyone wanted to order a drink, etc (which is how hotels make money!).

We’re thrilled to hear that you had such a memorable experience at NH Bentota Ceysands. Your kind words about the tranquil pool area, delicious food, and unbeatable location between the river and sea truly mean a lot to us. It’s wonderful to know that our team exceeded your expectations—especially Thilak, Maheshani, and the Ceylon Club team. They will be so pleased to hear your appreciation.

We’re delighted you enjoyed the peaceful setting, the easy access to local attractions, and the perfect blend of nature and convenience our resort offers.

We look forward to welcoming you back for another relaxing and luxurious beach getaway in the near future!

The pool and poolside are brilliantly thought out and massive so you can have a peaceful dip even if it's busy (I went out of season). My riverside room was the perfect way to start every day and the food, even the Western food, is really good. The service is unrivalled, it surpassed my expectations. I would say the hotel's greatest asset is its location in between the river and the sea, where you also you get lots of wildlife. And a 7 minute walk (plus couple of minutes shuttle boat to the town side) to Aluthgama train station. The minute you're out of the town side entrance, you're in the thick of town life but you wouldn't know it from the island oasis the hotel is on. It's walking distance to the Secret Island temple and Bentota Bridge, which are the only things Bentota offers other than beach. I would 100% stay here again and recommend it to everyone who comes to Sri Lanka for a relaxed, luxurious beach holiday.

Special shout out to Thilak the boatman and Masheshani on reception, who was a star. Auic and all who worked at Ceylon Club.","First class experience","2025-04","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612384-d4871240-r1009101416-Nh_Bentota_Ceysands_Resort-Aluthgama_Western_Province.html",

Были в отеле The Palms с 22.04.25 по 30.04.25. Отель очень понравился. Нам дали классный номер 402, на самом высоком этаже, с очень красивым видом на океан. Отель прям очень релаксовый, каких то движух и анимации нет. Вечером бывают какие то шоу, ну и в целом все. Вместо музыки днем-шум океана. Природа очень красивая. В отеле очень много барандуков, павлины, выбраны, черепахи и рыбки. По еде все было вкусно и разнообразно, но местами островато. По алкоголю было пиво, коктейли, крепкий алкоголь, но не было вина и шампанского. Теперь пляж. Самый шикарный в округе. Волны не сильные, потому что есть волнорез, вода очень теплая, выходить не хочется. На пляже есть кафе, если стоять лицом к океану, слева. Мы ходили туда есть морских гадов, очень вкусно и меню на русском. Мы зашли туда случайно, денег с собой почти не было, но ланкийцы такие добрые и гостеприимные, что накормили, а оставшуюся небольшую сумму денег мы принесли вечером. В кафе мы познакомились с хозяином кафе- Диланом. Он прекрасно говорит на русском и проводит экскурсии, обязательно расскажет где что лучше купить, и поменяет деньги по выгодному курсу. Мы к сожалению познакомились с ним позже, чем купили экскурсию у гида, и пожалели. Ездили на туманные горы, очень красиво, советую. Но поездка через гида-это самые дорогие магазины. Люди с отеля ездили через Дилана, и остались очень довольны, у него программа насыщеннее, магазины недорогие, хороший автобус и цена дешевле. Еще он нам очень помог. Мы на экскурсии купили лекарства, а инструкцию потеряли. Написали гиду, она даже отвечать не стала, вот что значит уехали с отдыха, интереса нет. У нас осталась визитка Дилана, написала ему, и он прислал инструкцию. Такая доброта трогает до глубины души. В целом об отдыхе могу сказать, что это было шикарно, отель очень атмосферный, персонал очень старается исполнить любую просьбу. Это одно из лучших наших путешествий, хотя посетили много стран и отелей, есть с чем сравнить. Оставлю номер Дилана, сто процентов будет полезен +94 77 625 7261.","Прекрасная Шри-Ланка ❤️❤️❤️","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d777127-r1007944142-The_Palms-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

There are three room types: standard, superior and queen. We had a superior A/C room with dark wooden floors, heavenly four-poster bed draped in a mosquito net, all kinds of subdued lighting, double wash-basin bathroom with separate shower and toilet and a small, comfortable garden terrace.

The owner, Samasuria, is friendly and runs the place very efficiently. He is supported by his charming wife, who bakes cakes and makes joghurt and Sri Lankan breakfast specialities for the guests. His sons and daughter-in-law are always there with a smile and a chat.

The pool area is surounded by tropical greenery dotted here and there with aralia(frangipani), bougainvillea, heliconia and banana trees - a veritable riot of colour. The pool is cleaned every day, there is ample sun and shade areas and the sun-loungers are comfortable. The pool is often visited by scampering chipmonks, flamboyant peacocks and the occasional troop of monkeys.

Breakfast is a real event with huge fresh fruit platters, eggs of all kinds, Sri Lankan specialities like hoppers, dhal and jaggery pancakes made by Mama, homemade joghurt and honey and all the usual breakfast items like toast, tea, coffee and jam.

To my surprise there was very less noise except at the temporary restaurant. 
Also, some of the rooms are being renovated. 
Saying that a lot of improvements to be seen. The guest relations team is checking on the needs of the guests and as a repeat guest, a lot of staff recognises you.
Not only the front of the house staff but all those who do not come in direct contact with guests are doing a wonderful job. To name a few. Isuru from the gym, Basil from the animation team and the Indian chef and his team. Bringing down a Indian. chef is has been one good thing to  increase the variety. The food is always good at Pegasus.
I know I have forgotten more names but next time, I will definitely include them. Adding photos of a few staff with their full consent. 
Pegasus needs to be more consistent on the standards.  For example, tissue boxes were available last year in the toilet but this year only on request,  the guest relations team hands in plates of chocolate and biscuits but one day, it's two pieces and another just one. Keep up the good work and improve the standards.

The conference facilities and accommodation is spacious but facilities in the public areas need to be updated as they feel aged. The staff were hospitable and competent, and there was a good selection of cuisine at mealtimes, with well prepared and tasty dishes, with attentive service.  Sahani at the reception was excellent in making guests feel welcome and made it a memorable experience.
Suggestions for improvement: Conference facilities need better illumination, with different options available for different users.
Accommodation: the refillable shower and bath products are environmentally friendly, but from a personal point of view I had no guarantee that they were fit for use as the containers were not sealed.  There was no assurance that these were not the same items used by a previous guests, just topped up.  I used my own products. Providing smaller reusable containers that can be refilled and sealed for each guest would be a better option.","An enduring venue","2025-05","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189028-d579219-r1009946077-Pegasus_Reef_Hotel-Wattala_Western_Province.html",

With the recent renovations, all the rooms were upgraded to the premium quality. Very clean and tidy hotel. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed due to renovations and meals were served in their banquet halls.
The dinner was amazing with lots of western selections. As far as quality of the food is concerned, all dishes were greatly appreciated by our French guests. So that gives the guarantee on the quality of their food, no need further explanations.

Отель нам понравился спокойствием, дружелюбием персонала, удобным расположением. Из за принимающей стороны нас заселили сначала в номер с видом на дорогу, хотя был забронирован вид на реку. Так как я настаивала , чтоб дали номер, согласно бронированию, пришел хозяин отеля и объяснил, что номеров данной категории нет(все занято), и пообещал переселить через 3 дня. Что и было выполнено.
Получилось пожить в 2х категориях номеров. Хочется отметить,что в комнате с видом на дорогу все очень симпатично, он, по нашим впечатлениям больше по размеру, и есть окно в ванной, можно принимая душ, любоваться видом на верхушки пальм ,это очень интересно. Если бы не постоянный шум машин, когда находишься на балконе, можно было  и остаться в таком номере(№116).
Нас переселили в номер 126, он меньше, и по ощущениям требует небольшого косметического ремонта. Балкончик гораздо меньше. Вид на реку и растительность на противоположном берегу. Там живет колония летучих лисиц,интересно наблюдать за их полетами. 
В номере стандартно чайник, мини холодильник, по 2 пакетика чая, кофе, 2 бутылки воды. Полотенца белоснежные, постель чистая. Из недостатков-кондиционер дует прямо на постель. 
У нас был полупансион.  Если вы не фанат яиц во всех видах, на завтрак вам предстоит есть только блинчики и фрукты. На  аперитив дают очень вкусный фреш из папайи. На ужин очень много острых блюд, любителям пан-азиатской кухни понравится. Если хотите поменьше специй, можно заказывать куриную грудку или крылышки гриль, супы.( По остроте -это мои личные ощущения,для мужа было приемлемо). Нам очень понравился буйволиный йогурт с пальмовым медом на десерт.
Ужин по меню, напитки не включены.
Конечно, большую роль в том,что мы прекрасно отдохнули в этом отеле, сыграли замечательные люди, которые здесь работают.  Их доброжелательность, услужливость , жизнерадостные улыбки поднимали нам настроение каждый день. От всей души благодарим Saman, Samith, Nipun, Samceva и всех остальных ребят!
Экскурсии на близкие расстояния мы брали у Манжулы. Он и лодочник, и тук-тукер. Ездили с ним на маяк на острове Барберин, в Косгоду на черепашью ферму, Хиккадуву, рыбалку на Бентоте. Он же организовал нам индивидуальную экскурсию в дождевой лес Синхараджа на комфортном авто. Цены фиксированные, всегда все вовремя, по русски может объясниться. Мы им очень довольны!

Очень радушные и доброжелательные хозяева. Любые вопросы по сервису решаются сразу на месте. 
Расположение удачное, совсем недалеко от океана, на реке. Да, это не первая линия, но ведь интересно же на лодочке по реке за несколько минут доплыть до окена. Пока плывете, насмотритесь всякой живности. Если повезет, увидите и варанов, и крокодилов. 
Номеров немного, соответственно и толп туристов нет.
Номера стандартные. В номерах кондиционеры.
Персонал приветливый и отзывчивый, но иногда придется быть понастойчивее.
Еда может показаться однообразной, потому что это Азия и в основном это вариации риса. Но к рису много разнообразных морепродуктов. Множество свежих фруктов, и в гостиничном ресторане, и в округе. Большой плюс, что можно договориться с рестораном, и вам приготовят креветки, купленные на рынке, или же пожарят выловленную в океане или реке рыбу.
Небольшой собственный пирс с кофе (можно заказать эспрессо) или пивом на реке утречком или вечерком.
Есть небольшой бассейн. Чистый, кстати.
В целом очень хорошее впечатление - уютный небольшой отель с доброжелательными хозяевами и услужливым персоналом.

1. ﻿﻿﻿Относительно не далеко от Аэропорта, большая часть пути проходит по скоростным шоссе, после длительного перелета, поверьте, это имеет значение:)
2. ﻿﻿﻿Отель расположен на берегу живописной реки, утром будит пение птиц, завтракая вы запросто можете увидеть в реке варана, пальмовую белку или даже крокодила. До пляжа вас бесплатно увезут и привезут на лодке, причем это будет лучший пляж в округе с идеальной водой и волнами и минимумом людей! К тому же рядом с пляжем, в тени деревьев находится буддистский храм, место, куда хочется возвращаться еще и еще. Когда мы прогулялись по побережью и посмотрели пляжи рядом с популярными отелями в Бентоте, то еще раз оценили, в каких райских условиях мы отдыхаем!
3. ﻿﻿﻿Отель небольшой, очень уютный, чисто, внимательный персонал, с первого дня чувствуешь себя в кругу друзей. Никаких толп у шведского стола, вы в любое время можете прийти покушать, для вас всегда найдется столик и обслужит официант.
4. Еще один плюс: вышли из отеля - и вы в городе! В шаговой доступности любые магазины, аптеки, рестораны. За 100-150 руб вас свозят на тук-туке и туда и обратно. Есть возможность посмотреть жизнь ланкийцев изнутри, поверьте, это очень интересно!
5. 5.

О пляже🏝️ Есть два выхода на пляж, один пешком, где расположены отели ( не рекомендую, так как река Бентота вливается там в океан и несет грязную воду) и второй выход к лучшему пляжу с чистой водой это на лодке от отеля, совершенно бесплатно , 5 минут.При отеле есть бассейн, полотенце, лежаки и зонтики все можно получить у лодочника Самана.
О номерах🏫:В номере есть гостевая карта с описанием необходимой информацией и прайсом на путешествия и массаж. В номерах идеальная чистота, все из натурального дерева, нет запаха плесени, как в других отелях, персонал всегда улыбчивый и готовый помочь. К нам приходила в гости обезьяна и варан, из номера можно каждый день наблюдать за летучими лисами и плавающим вараном, иногда крокодил греется на солнце.
О еде! 🥗:Это шедевры повара, все очень вкусно, рыба с рисом и овощами на гриле,аргентинский стейк,креветки, лобстер...👌На завтрак стандарт: каша или омлет с беконом, блинчики, тарелка фруктов, свежевыжатый сок,чай или кофе, булочки с мармеладом.
Потрясающий вид с крыши ресторана, есть открытая зона под небом и есть закрытая с кондиционером, что очень комфортно для гостей на случай жары или дождя.О путешествиях🛤️: самые ближайшие это город порт Галле, сад Бриф Гарден, Хиккадува покормить огромных черепах в океане, Ялла парк. Это все осень стоит посмотреть, тем более поблизости.

Thank you so much for staying at The Plams Beruwala and taking the time to share such detailed feedback.

We’re glad to hear you enjoyed the beach, warm ocean waters, and the tropical vibe here at Beruwala, one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. It’s always great to see guests embracing the island lifestyle, soaking up the sun, and enjoying nature. We’re also happy you liked the food variety and cocktails. Our chefs love showcasing Sri Lankan flavours, but we know not everyone enjoys spicy food, so we’re always sure to include non-spicy and Western-style options too.

Thanks for highlighting the fun beach activities like yoga and volleyball, and for mentioning areas where we can improve. We’re sorry for the room issues and insect concerns. We’re working on upgrades and better pest control to make things more comfortable. While the beach is public, it’s extremely safe and surrounded by friendly people. Many guests enjoy the lively beach atmosphere, while we also maintain quiet spaces within our gardens overlooking the ocean for those seeking peace and privacy.

We’re really grateful for your honest feedback. It helps us improve while also reminding us what guests enjoy most. We’d love to welcome you back again for an even better stay next time.

Warm regards,

Dilan Bandara

Пляж правда с песком как мука, без ракушек и кораллов, без какой-либо морской живности (кроме раков отшельников и небольших крабов). Пляжи здесь как я понимаю - все общественные, поэтому отдел��ная территория отделена от пляжа сеткой ( не всегда эстетичной). Так вот за этой сеткой сидят местные зазывалы, продавцы и т.д., большинство из них подготовлены и знают русский язык. Но сам факт, что ты лежишь на территории отеля - загораешь, эти мужики сидят и пялятся на тебя- очень раздражает. За каждым пляжем закреплена собака) Да, здесь по всему острову бегают дружелюбные собачки ( пос ловам местных -они все домашние). 
Про воду и волны. Вода не пахнет, соленая (при попадании в глаза немного щиплет), была 30 градусов каждый день, под конец дня она казалась просто горячей. Здесь чувствуется всё тепло индийского океана. По чистоте воды: от волн образуется желтоватая пена, если купаешься в белой рубашке, защищающей от солнца - она станет коричневатой. По словам местных - из-за песка. Величина волн меняется в зависимости от приливов и отливов, глубина около полутора метров. Сначала волны раздражали, но концу отдыха пришли к мнению, что с ними даже интересней. Я поставил на часы циферблат с графиком приливов и отливов и всегда был в курсе.
Из развлечений на пляже: серфинг, волейбол, каждое утро йога. 
В отеле отдыхает много иностранцев: французы, немцы, индусы. В конце нашего отдыха завезли человек 20 пожилых французов. Вроде бы они не мешают, но заполняют собой очень много пространства.
По еде: Карри карри карри карри. Нужно обращать внимание на значки “spicy”. Можно сказать, что еда разнообразная, почти каждый день было что-то новое. Рекомендую попробовать все коктейли по системе все включено, попадаются вкусные. 
Сам отель и номера «подуставшие». Жили в двух номерах, так как первый был грязноват, может быть не успели убраться к заселению. Уборка ежедневная, бельё менять не стесняются (а уборка нужна каждый день: песок с пляжа идет в номер замечательно). Шумоизоляция  в номере плохая: со стороны океана вы будете слушать всю ночь шум волн, а дверь в номер простая деревянная, через нее слышно всех всех птиц, которые обитают во внутреннем дворе. 
Из неприятного наверное единственное: несколько раз приходилось убивать тaракана с указательный палец. По просьбе номер обрабатывают от насекомых и около 2 дней его не увидите. Я не смог это умолчать, какие бы хорошие впечатления не оставил отель. 
Но все равно спасибо за эти 11 ночей.","палмс","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d777127-r1006029042-The_Palms-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Thank you for your kind words and for sharing your experience with us. We're glad to hear that your stay at The Palms Beruwala was a relaxing and enjoyable one.

We appreciate your understanding regarding the initial room arrangement, and we’re happy it was resolved smoothly. It’s wonderful to know that you enjoyed the extensive buffet, our spacious grounds, pool area, and beachfront setting.

We’re especially pleased that you found your room comfortable and enjoyed the balcony with its sea view. The beach right in front of our hotel is truly one of the best along the coast, and we’ve placed sunbeds directly on the sand for your comfort, a rare option in the area. For those looking to stay active, we also offer a beach volleyball court to enjoy some fun under the sun.

Etwas renovierungsbedürftig, aber sauber und zweckmäßig. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und bieten alles, was man braucht. Balkon oder Terrasse mit 2 Stühlen, Tisch, großes Bett mit toller Matratze, Ventilator und Klimaanlage. Großer Schminktisch, Beistellcouch mit Tisch, kleiner Kühlschrank, Wasserkocher (Tee und Kaffee werden täglich aufgefüllt, ebenso wie 2 ltr. Wasser), geräumiges Bad mit ausreichend Ablagemöglichkeiten und recht großer Dusche. 
Die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter sind alle sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, spätestens am 2. Tag wissen sie, was man am liebsten trinken möchte. Essen wird sowohl einheimisch, als auch für Ost-asiatische Gäste, ebenso für Europäer angeboten. Vegetarische Gerichte sind ebenfalls immer vorhanden. Alles ist entsprechend gekennzeichnet. Achtung: wo spicy dran steht, ist es für europäische Zungen wirklich SEHR scharf. 
Es ist schwierig unter all den ""guten Geistern"" des Hauses einige wenige herauszustellen, denn eigentlich müssten alle erwähnt werden. 
Wenn man jedoch jemanden besonders erwähnen sollte, so ist das Dinesh, der Restaurantleiter, der mit ganz viel Weitsicht und Umsicht seine Kolleginnen und Kollegen führt und sich auch nicht scheut, selbst Hand anzulegen, wenn es gerade mal voll ist im Restaurant. Und der mir erlaubt hat, mal ein paar Minuten früher ins Restaurant zu kommen, um all die leckeren Köstlichkeiten zu fotografieren. Danke dafür, Dinesh. 
Oder auch Saranga und Terence vom Pool, die uns nicht nur mit Liegen, Auflagen, Handtüchern und guter Laune versorgen (Saranga sogar in Deutsch), sondern auch als Bademeister für unser aller Sicherheit sorgen.

We're glad the all-inclusive package worked well for you, and that you liked the variety of food, drinks, and of course, the desserts. Thanks as well for the great tips about local attractions—Ella, Adam’s Peak, and ocean fishing are truly special experiences.

Отдыхали вместе с друзьями в конце марта 2025 года. Очень замечательный и симпатичный отель, уютная зеленая территория, по которой бегают бурундуки и можно встретить варанчиков, в прудах плавают цветные рыбки и черепахи. Широкий чистый пляж с волейбольной площадкой. Хорошие шезлонги на травке. Дружелюбный и вежливый персонал. Чисто, опрятно, всё работает. Все номера с видом на океан, большой балкон, новый кондиционер. Рекомендую брать all inclusive, чтобы не тратить время на поиск места, где перекусить. Еда разнообразная, выбор есть: с местным колоритом - острая и обычным вкусом. Вкусное шоколадное и ванильное мороженное, десерты и фрукты. Пепси, миринда, севенап и тоник - оригинальные. Пиво Lion хорошее, из крепких рекомедую тёмный арак (ром). Если кто курит, то сигареты берите с собой, здесь они они стоят очень дорого и качество не очень. Обязательно рекомедую ознакомиться с местными достопримечательностями: посетить реку Бентота, буддийский храм, фруктовые, чайные и сувенирные лавки. Из экскурсий рекомедую - посетить город Элла, малый пик Адама, водопад, чайные плантации, прокатиться на местном поезде по красивым местам; съездить на остров с маяком и обязательно на рыбалку в океан, там в дали от берега вы увидите красивейший океан, обязательно искупайтесь, возможно встретите дельфинов или китов. Во время движения тролинг и донная рыбалка. Все что поймаете, вам могут приготовить. По всем экскурсиям и путешествиям рекомедую обращаться к Дилану (ватсап +94 77 625 7261) русскоговорящий гид, он все организует, очень приятный человек, профессионал своего дела, всегда внимательно выслушает вас и постарается исполнить ваши пожелания.

We were in Sri Lanka for our honeymoon and the owners made the occasion really special, decorating our room with fresh flowers, balloons and even giving us some homemade cake. We loved everything about our stay here.

The location - a short walk from the main beach, but just across the road from the turtle bay beach which is more unspoilt. The property extends really far back so it’s very peaceful where the rooms are and by the pool.

The rooms- We stayed in one of the superior rooms, it was very spacious and spotlessly clean. The shower was the best we had during our time in Sri Lanka (powerful and lots of hot water if you wanted it). The rooms must have had good sound insulation as they were really quiet which made for a great nights sleep. 

The pool - The cleanest pool I have ever seen and obviously tended to on a regular basis by the owner. The pool area was a haven, overlooking tropical plants and trees, peacocks, and even monkeys. 

Breakfast - A huge fresh breakfast was available every morning, and the owners were very flexible about timings. We liked to surf early morning  and had breakfast around 10am, but on our last morning due to a lunch time flight we were able to have breakfast at 0630, nothing seemed like too much trouble. Our
breakfast usually consisted of fresh coffee, a big plate of tropical fruit, fresh yogurt and honey, fried eggs and toast (with homemade bread). 

The people - Morning Star is family run and while
being very professional you are also made to feel at home and cared for. The family and staff (Sriyani) were some of the kindest most genuine people we have met and had a real talent for hospitality. We were always met with genuine smiles and warmth. 

If you want a clean, peaceful and relaxing place to stay Morning Star is for you. Thank you so much to the family and Sriyani for making our stay so special, we hope we can come back soon 😊","Amazing Stay at Morning Star","2022-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d3784934-r825201470-Morning_Star-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",

This familly run hotel was amazing. The owner and his familly were so helpful, friendly and went above all expectations, organising two trips for us, laundry and lending us snorkel gear. 
Location is great, you only have to cross the road and you are on the beach. Turtle Bay did not disappoint, we saw many turtles! 
The room was fantastic, clean and spacious.  Breakfast was perfect for the day ahead, eggs, yogert and fruit but also offered traditional Sri Lankan breakfast. Dinner was also worth excepting- delicious add on. 
The pool is situated at the back of the property, which is in a relaxing environment with comfortable sun loungers.

stay at Morning Star hotel! Soo friendly, fantastic rooms, nice pool with a mango garden, and only 400meter from turtle beach! Easy to navigate in Merissa. We went with personal driver, but tuktuk is allways good option.

Merissa offers good diversity of excurstions and aswel as the good local food.

Best breakfrust we had, was @ Morningstar hotel, waow🥰 during our entire trip(4weeks)

We where the first customers after Covid19 to visit this beautiful hotel, nice aircon & good spacy rooms. Staff is fantastic, there smile will make your day🥰
Anura, the manager took great care of us
We wish to come back soon

The family is very helpful and every answer to a question is no problem and they help in every way. They are also honest if something is not good if advise is asked.

The son brought us to our next location and we were given a cake once we left.

 A minute stroll to turtle bay beach perfect location. 
On leaving the chief’s wife gave us homemade cake. They are wonderful hosts & the 2 sons & daughter are very kind always smiling always helping. 

They genuinely care & have your best interest with them.  

So well done to the family of this wonderful guest house they do deserve 5 stars. And more if I can give them.

Restaurant on the roof is amazing. Pleasant location, nice view and comfortable cafeteria by the river. I really enjoyed three special things in this hotel: fresh fruit juice, massage salon and the idea of taking you to the beach by boat. Btw, there are two beaches around the hotel. You have to go on foot ~5 mins to the first one, but there are lots of people. That's why I preferred the second beach, a boatman takes you there for free. An extremely clean beach and water, free loungers, almost no people. This hotel also offers a service to get you from the airport and back, that's very important as for me. And the prices are reasonable. Hotel staff organized a pleasant tour to Yala Park for me and my friends, that was amazing as well.

Two of our party have stayed in the Arena Hotel many times before and we joined them on their recommendation.

The hotel is great!! The staff are amazing and every single one of them welcomed us as if we were their family. The service is perfect, the food is a wonderful mix of Sri Lankan and world cuisine, lovingly prepared by their amazingly talented and very high class head chef and his team. 

The rooms are spotless and very comfortable, with the most amazing towel art left on your bed every day, ranging from Swans to Crocodiles - just outstanding.

I must make a point of mentioning the most amazing member of staff Nalin.
Nalin made our holiday. He arranged everything from trips to the beach via the hotel's own speedboat to excursions to Galle, wildlife safari's to Yala National Park (where we saw everything from Bee-eaters to Elephants - a simply amazing day!), river trips, fishing trips, he took us wherever we wanted to go in his tuc tuc including the amazing Kande Viharaya Temple (about a mile from the hotel). Nalin introduced us to the real Sri Lanka and it's amazing culture - thank you so much.

By the way, the views from the Arena sky restaurant are amazing!

If like I, you are looking for amazing wildlife and culture, Sri Lanka is the place for you, it's a country of outstanding beauty and sensory overloads!

Would we return to the Arena Hotel? Damned right we would!
In fact, we are panning our next visit in 2020 right now!

We had a holiday of a lifetime and a massive part of this was down to the Arena Hotel and their amazing staff.

We can't thank every one of you enough - See you all again in 2020

A friend of the owner made reservations for us, and the owner took care of everything from that moment onward. From making sure fresh lobster was available, to transporting us to/from the restaurant, he and his staff made sure that everything was seamless for a perfect farewell dinner. Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, I love meeting others who have a passion for hospitality, and Arena and staff hit all of the marks! The grilled lobster was mouthwatering, accompanied by attentive and friendly service throughout our meal. The cherry on top is the view—the restaurant sits atop the 4-story hotel offering panoramic views of Beruwala, ocean, river, and Buddha statue included :) seeing the sunset without any obstructions was amazing and the perfect way to end our time in Beruwala. On our next visit we hope to check out the hotel—if it is anything like our dinner then I have no doubt it is a wonderful place to stay while visiting Sri Lanka. We will definitely be back!","Dinner with a breathtaking 360° view!","2019-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d11894777-r658388761-Arena_Hotel-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",

Don't expect a beach you can swim in, it's more scenic than practical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Pegasus Reef for a night, mainly for its location not too far from Colombo and the airport. The hotel has a calm, open feel with a spacious garden and a nice pool area by the sea, which was a lovely spot to unwind after a long journey.

Rooms were clean and spacious, though a bit outdated in design. The bed was comfortable, but the AC was a little loud. The staff were helpful, especially at check-in, and they even managed to accommodate a last-minute request with no fuss. Room service was quick and portions were generous.

However, the food could be better. The buffet didn’t quite match the standard you'd expect for the price, and some dishes lacked flavor. Also, the beach is not really swimmable, more for views than beach lounging.

If you're just looking for a comfortable place to relax near the airport or Colombo, it's a decent pick. But if you're expecting a resort-style beachfront experience or top-tier dining, you might want to explore other options.","A Decent Stay Near Colombo - Good for a Night or Two","2024-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189028-d579219-r1002132963-Pegasus_Reef_Hotel-Wattala_Western_Province.html",
