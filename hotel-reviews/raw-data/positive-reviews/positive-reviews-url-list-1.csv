The views of the lake were gorgeous, and it was great taking the boat to our bungalow and back with the help of the very friendly staff. 

At the bungalow, our attentive butler Ajith and the other staff in the residence attended to us immediately and explained how everything works. They took really good care of us, and we appreciate all their efforts to answer all our questions. The days we spent here were so relaxing (and the gorgeous historic interior was another plus), and we were constantly wowed by the delicious food – we really appreciated Chef’s efforts to prepare local Sri Lankan dishes we missed. 

The food was delicious and we were never left wanting for more. 

We also enjoyed the tour of the tea factory, where we got to learn more about the tea making process, and even try a variety of teas.

Our room was enormous, with a four poster bed and a large bathroom with luxurious clawfoot tub.  There is no ""menu"" for meals -- the chef comes to speak with you to propose a menu for each meal, which you can adjust depending on your preferences.  Food was delicious, we particularly loved the Sri Lankan hoppers for breakfast, and the afternoon high tea.  In terms of activities, the tour of the tea factory was extremely interesting and informative, there are lots of beautiful walks / hikes, and we also enjoyed kayaking on the lake.

Zum all inclusive Paket gehört wirklich alles - auch Drinks in der edlen Lounge oder im Zimmer, Wäschereinigung und der Besuch einer Teefabrik mit Führung. 

Bei diesem Tagesausflug konnten wir zwei weitere Unterkünfte der Ceylon Tea Trails (Castlereagh und Dunkeld) kennenlernen. Diese waren genauso edel und stilvoll.

We were a family of four (kids are 7 and 3) and we had an incredible time. We stayed in Tientsin Bungalow. Everything about it was great. The grounds of the Bungalow were absolutely beautiful, the hospitality of the staff was faultless and the food was some of the best I’ve ever eaten.  There were so many personal touches I appreciated, for example it was our son’s third birthday while we were there and they made a personalised chocolate cake for him, decorated the table and sung happy birthday. Also every morning at 6am they’d bring a coffee to the room as I would get up to go for a run through the tea trails. There was hardly anyone staying there when we were there so sometimes we had the place to ourselves. Would definitely recommend and would love to be back some day :)

The only thing I’d recommend is make sure if you use a private driver they know where your bungalow is . The bungalows are all located a few kilometres apart (which I did not realise) and initially we were taken to the wrong bungalow.

This review relates to the Castlereagh Bungalow only, we did not see the others.  We stayed two nights in a Garden Suite. 

There was some confusion on location and jhow to find the correct venue.  In fact we had to find Summerville Bungalow and were taken across the lake by private boat to the Castlereagh side, as apparently the road around is long, windy, and bumpy 

The charming bungalow has only five rooms (perhaps six). The vibe is old colonial and personal service.  There are no room keys for example, which is lovely. The stay is all inclusive including wine and spirits, and all designed to make you feel like you are a plantation owner 

The butler, Janaka, ensures everything is set up for a relaxing time and catering for your every need.   

The chef will suggest menus for lunch and dinner, and amend according to your likes and dislikes.  And he can cook well, we absolutely loved the Sri Lankan meal he created with nine different curry dishes. 

The decor, of the room and the public areas is fully old world charm. The views over the gardens and lake are beautiful.   

I can recommend the tour of the nearby tea factory, where the guide is knowledgeable and entertaining.  We learned a lot and were not bored in the slightest.

This was pure luxury.  The perfect way to relax. The place is nestled up in the hills rocked in the middle of tea plantations.  So serene and beautiful.  Every morning the chef would have a small chat and see what you would like to eat and prepare lunch and dinner accordingly.  Each dish was out of this world.  The high tea is a winner!Thank you chef Rangana and team.  You can also visit the other bungalows around the reservoir for a meal. They organized an informative visit to the Dunkeld Tea factory and the guide, Bernard, was like a walking Tea Encyclopedia. At the bungalow they have a lovely swimming pool and this stunning jacuzzi tucked away in the corner to give you added privacy.  The rooms are classy, well appointed and spotless and maintain the true heritage of the place.  
The staff are so attentive and ensure to cater to your every need whilst ensuring your privacy is not compromised at any time. Have to mention Dasun and his super team of Janaka, Wahed and Priya.  Just left no stone unturned turned in ensuring my every need was met and the stay was memorable.  Truly relaxing and allowed me to totally switch off and reset.  
Highly recommended.

From the moment we arrived, Sanjaya and his team went out of their way to make sure everything was just right. They really took care of us and made us feel so welcome.

I have a severe nut and sesame allergy, and I can’t say enough about how well the kitchen team handled it. Every meal was carefully planned, and they always came up with something exciting for lunch and dinner. I even got to pick the entire menu twice, which was such a treat! The chef and his team truly deserve a lot of credit for their attention to detail.

A special shoutout to Kumara, who looked after us every evening at dinner. His service was next level, and his cocktails wonderful. His friendly and attentive nature really made a difference to our overall experience.

The bungalow itself is well-kept with a simple yet elegant design. The views of the reservoir are stunning, and the pool is a lovely place to unwind—though the water was a bit on the cooler side! One small thing to mention is that, like at other Resplendent properties we’ve stayed at, the beds are quite firm. Ours seemed to be two mattresses pushed together, so there was a small gap in the middle—not a huge deal, but something to note for those who prefer a softer bed.

The activities on offer were enjoyable, but we were a bit surprised to see a $30 charge for kayaking around the reservoir on your own, especially given that this was an all-inclusive stay. In most other hotels and resorts we’ve been, kayaking is nearly always included.

All in all, we had an unforgettable time and truly appreciated the warmth and hospitality of the entire team.","Cosy Sri Lankan Homely vibes","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r999527743-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

The estate is beautiful and the rooms are large and comfortable. It was nice having a small electric heater fireplace in the room as the weather was chillier than expected since you are up in the mountains. A very different climate than we came from in Colombo. The experience feels like being a guest in the home of a friend (a very well-to-do friend) more than a hotel because the stay is so warm and welcoming. 

Every meal in the restaurant was a delight. (You must try the Sri Lankan breakfast.) Janaka provided wonderful service and we were always given way more food than we could eat but wished we could finish it because the flavors were so good. Not just the taste but also the presentation of each dish was well done. 

The private sauna experience in the spa was a nice, relaxing surprise. While I did not personally take advantage of the other spa services, my husband enjoyed his Vietnamese massage. 

The ability to communicate with the staff via WhatsApp proved very convenient and Staicy was always prompt, polite, and helpful in her responses. 

Since we visited during the rainy season we hired a car to drive us around to the tea plantations and waterfalls. If we had wanted to walk to town, it would have only been a short 10 minute walk but we wanted to see some of the sights a bit further out.

I had my doubts about the hotel despite excellent rating. 

Ambience 
In the middle of the Nuwara Eliya yet peaceful. Most points / places to visit (except tea estates and farms) are walking distance. 

Rooms
Spacious airy. Modern yet with old colonial charm.
Rooms have most amenities available in regular hotels.

Staff 
Courteous, friendly and caring. A big shout out to Stacy and Janaka who made our stay even more comfortable. Stacy is helpful, knows her brief and whilst toeing hotel policies still manages to make your stay more comfortable and fun. Janaka was always around - he followed our food requests to the T. 
Irshad without hesitating subscribed to a channel we wanted. It was amazing no questions asked - you are our guest you want it we will get it (for reasonable requests).

Food and Restaurant 
The best hoppers I have had ever. Super light and delicious. Our first time experience of 4 course breakfast - local fruits, granola with curd, hoppers with 4 curries and 2 sambals least course tea/ coffee/milk. 
We were asked our food preferences / dietary restrictions they were followed. 

The three course dinner was amazing! 

Only down side they don’t have 24 hour kitchen - so if you are the kinds who has food cravings middle of the night not sure if this place is for you. 

Amenities 
Plunge pool cum jacuzzi, steam room and sauna room. All three are situated in the out house with the spa. Only issue we faced was that the pool, steam and sauna were in such a small area that the steam from the steam room hits you on the face (whilst in plunge pool) if anyone opens it’s door.

I would not recommend the jacuzzi being on if you have young children who are also going to enter the pool with you. As the chlorine in the water and pressure from the jacuzzi spouts can make their eye really burn.

They have bicycles and also offer horse riding for a price. 

The horse rides and horse care takers were both very good. The first say they took us up the single tree mountain and next day they offered to take us on a different route through the race course and ‘forest’. The price u thought was high but after enquiring rates at tourist points it wasn’t that bad plus these horse rides are with people known to the hotel sand arranged through themso it’s better.

Conclusion 
Worth a stay if you don’t have young children with you.","Surprisingly amazing","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d25983119-r1010695188-The_Bellwood_Manor-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Der direkte Zugang zum traumhaften Sandstrand und das gepflegte Resortgelände sorgen für echtes Urlaubsfeeling. Kleine Abstriche gab es bei der Getränkeauswahl, insbesondere bei Sonderwünschen, auf die zunächst nicht eingegangen wurde – dies wurde jedoch nach Rücksprache freundlich gelöst. Insgesamt war die Getränkeauswahl zunächst sehr limitiert und es wird kein aktiver Service am Pool oder Strand angeboten. Auf Nachfrage war man aber auch hier sehr bemüht.
Verbesserungswürdig ist aus unserer Sicht die Sauberkeit im Bad: Kalkrückstände an Armaturen und stellenweise ausgefranste Frottierwaren passten nicht ganz zum ansonsten hohen Standard.

Quite simply the most beautiful hotel you could wish to stay. Where do i start.....

Location - stunning and tranquil setting with unspoilt ocean views from every view. The journey to the east coast is well worth the effort, and forgotten as you step through the door.

Facilities - quietly understated, but exceptional quality and simply luxurious. Quiet and secluded rooms tastefully spread across manicured grounds adds to a feeling of total peace and relaxation. Attention to detail ensures everything you could need is provided (and those that you didn't think you needed!)

Food - mind-blowing - creative dining with an expansive ever-changing menu; prepared with care and attention by the most creative and friendly team of talented chefs; presented consistently beautifully; and with a quality and range of flavours that was a delight to enjoy at every meal.

But what makes this hotel truly special are the staff - every member of staff goes above and beyond to make each guest feel welcome. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by welcoming smiling staff, to the time we left and they gathered to wave us off like part of the family, each member of staff goes far beyond their roles. Special mention needs to go to Sajeev for his care and attention to us both throughout our stay. And also a big thank you to Santha, Usara, Yassa, Rasini and Sathiya, but while those are only the names we remember, I am grateful to every member of the Uga Bay team - you have created a unique environment that helps create memories that will last.

Will we return? Without hesitation. Sajeev and team, we will see you again soon!","The closest place to paradise","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1008601268-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

From the reservation team in Colombo, notably Mr Jacques Anandappa and Mr Jithendra Abeysinghe and the reception team at the hotel, Professionalism was the order of the day. All arrangements were seamless and smooth and we left after a three nights stay with further unforgettable memories. The Ocean Studio King room where we stayed was spacious and luxuriously furnished with all modern amenities and has a direct view of the ocean. To start the day with a stroll on the   pristine white sandy beach and watch the Sun rise simply takes your breath away. During your stroll you may have the good fortune of meeting the local fishermen, hauling in their overnight catch. Boat rides and water sports are on offer from private companies. The pool is very inviting with crystal clear water and blue as the sky. The pool bar serves up some mouth watering bites and delicious cocktails. The food that is served in the restaurant is unbelievably delightful. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and caters for all palates with English, continental and Asian cuisine as well as a Sri Lankan corner. Nothing is too much for the Staff. If you need something extra, all you have to do is just ask Ramani, the restaurant Hostess, who will do her utmost to produce it for you. The dinner buffet's are no different with live stations displaying the chefs culinary prowess. In a hotel where all staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful, it is difficult to single out individuals for praise. However, during this stay, there were a few staff who stood out for us, we  would like to mention by name. Chef Hismath who was very obliging and produced the most wonderful Dosa for me. Chef Thusal, Trainee chef Sanuji  and waiter Munas were the others who were very helpful and obliging. Hostess Ramani with her cheerful smile was always there to welcome us into the restaurant and attended to all our needs. Last, but by no means least, Mr Neranjan Morais the General Manager who was very helpful and always visible in the background. 
All in all. it was another wonderful holiday for my wife and I, and counting the days when we could go there again.","Memorable Holiday at a Luxurious Beach Resort","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1008388743-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Sri Lanka but what really did make it special were the Sri Lankan people themselves and nowhere epitomised this more than at the Anantara.All the staff from those working on the grounds through cleaners,restaurant staff to front of house were friendly,helpful and usually happy to engage in conversation.You are made to feel especially welcome when dining at Journeys where we enjoyed chatting with Tachila,Thisari and others,often fairly new staff but very pleased to be working there.The manager of the pool bar,Greshan,was probably the nicest person we met in Sri Lanka and his story of surviving the tsunami we will never forget,thanks for the G&T’s!Likewise to the ‘beach boys’ Nuwan,Heshan and others who ensured our place on the grass for sundowners and just couldn’t stop smiling and laughing.Great guys.Front of house was Thisal who was at the end of all our WhatsApp’s sorting out laundry,drinks and every other request.Thanks
The grounds are immaculately kept with people sweeping from sunrise to sunset and contain many different trees,shrubs and plants as well as animals and birds,well worth taking a closer look at to appreciate.Don’t miss the man who climbs the impossibly high palm trees with just a bit of rope between his feet,chopping down coconuts.
The whole complex sweeps close to the shoreline and is bookended by the Il Mare Italian style restaurant high up overlooking the cliffs and wonderful on an evening to Verala Asian themed restaurant shaped to mimic 2 coconut shells and very impressive.We ate there 3 times and were expertly looked after by Rizvi enjoying watching the chefs with their clanging blades making the kotthu or other specials.
The beach in front of the hotel can be challenging to swim in and not for the inexperienced but the adjacent public beach Goyambaku is safer but still great fun for bodyboarding.
Our all inclusive package allowed us a one hour spa treatment which is very classy and we also enjoyed the high tea experience.I wanted to try a surfing lesson and the hotel have a company called Tropic surf which is located on site and run by Shaun and Lainey which take you to a safe and quiet beach some 20 minutes away by tuktuk.Great fun,very tiring but no good if you’re 63 and unfit!
The Anantara is very much a 5 star experience.","5 Star experience","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r938397950-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

She told us to call her at any time if we needed anything at any time!! She even made our restaurant reservations!!
We were upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View room which was large and spacious. The bed was super comfortable and the linen was soft and luxurious.
We had lunch at the Lobby Bar and the rice and curry was delicious and our steward Bashitha was super friendly and genuinely cared about making us happy and the supervisor Wiraj was a super nice person who ame and talked with us to make sure we were happy.
We had dinner at Il Mare Italian restaurant the first night and it was the most amazing experience.
Our steward Dinuka helped us to select our starters and main course which saved us time and as a result of his knowledge we loved what we ordered and enjoyed the meal!!
Since the food was so tasty we went back to the Poolside bar for lunch.
On Saturday we went to the Verela restaurant for dinner and we were ordering funentertained by a saxophonist who played some unbelievable music.

Here too our well trained steward Manula was exceptionally helpful and before long we were able to order our food!!
Finally our room attendant Dilip cleaned the room, toilet and bed and brought extra water since we liked to drink a lot of water. I could see that he enjoyed his job from the smile on his face!!
The front office staff too were very happy and I believe that they enjoyed their work.

We had a great experience. The property is beautiful. Great expanse and lovely spaces. 
The room was spacious, exactly as described online. 
The common areas, garden and beach access all were great. 
We used the spa as well and the therapists were very good. 

It is a great spot to relax, unwind. The drive from Colombo is also super convenient- very good roads. Easy access. 

The staff is very very nice and warm. Super attentive. Every person we met was always smiling and eager to help. They have a concierge system and it’s very effective. Our concierge was Thisari and she was so so nice. We were fortunate to have met her. She was so attentive, always available and helping us with various things. 
I would like to say a special thanks to her for her warmth and hospitality. 

All the other staff were also extremely nice, helpful, warm always smiling. 
Was lovely to meet a friendly face at breakfast or while walking at the property. Imalka served us breakfast several times and made very nice coffee each time. He was very sweet. 

My only suggestion would be to improve the taste of non Sri Lankan food that is served at the hotel. When we were bored of eating Sri Lankan, we would try the Asian but this was not the best. 

Apart from this, we had a lovely and a memorable stay.","Lovely stay at Anantara","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1015907171-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Ayubowan from Anantara Tangalle, Sri Lanka! 
Thank you sincerely for sharing such a heartfelt and detailed review of your recent stay with us at our resort in Sri Lanka.
We’re thrilled to hear that your experience truly lived up to the name Peace Haven—it means so much to us that you felt cared for from the moment you arrived, to the time you checked out. Your kind recognition of our team, especially Hashan, has been warmly shared with them. It brings us great joy to know that our team's genuine hospitality stood out and made a lasting impression on you.
We’re also pleased that you enjoyed the culinary experiences, particularly the breakfast buffet and our live juice station. While à la carte dining is more prominent during the quieter season, we’re delighted that you still found the offerings fresh and satisfying.
Your thoughtful words about the tranquil atmosphere and the resort’s ability to help guests “escape from reality” capture exactly what we aim to create—a sanctuary of serenity and natural beauty.
We look forward to welcoming you back to Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle in Sri Lanka whenever you need another peaceful getaway.

From the check-in to the check-out and everything else in between was amazing! 

The staff at Anantara Tangalle are some of the best I’ve come across. Their efforts in supporting the guests seem natural and authentic as opposed to being forced to do so. The personal guest relations staff assigned to the room (Hashan) was very helpful and made sure all the needs and requests were met. Every single staff from the Front Desk to the Restaurants and gardeners were all courteous beyond measure and greeted every single person crossing their path and made sure they were ready to help with anything. 

The food was delicious! Unfortunately the lunch and dinner at the main restaurants were only on à la carte basis due to the low season, however the Breakfast Buffet made up for it for sure. The spread was great and the quality of food and freshness from the live juice station is unmatched. Overall, this buffet is enough to satisfy your hunger for days. 

Overall, the hotel was excellent and would be a great choice for travellers visiting by themselves or their loved ones to escape from reality and enjoy some much needed peace and tranquility.","Truly a Peace Haven!","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1015854854-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

The spacious rooms were perfect for our wedding party to get ready in. The villas interior and exterior architecture was perfect for photography. 

The W15 team has done a great job preserving the heritage of the property while offering all the modern comforts for their guests. A huge shoutout to the incredible hospitality team consisting of Sheriff, Manjula, Prabod, Hasthasava, and Keerith. They went above and beyond for us. Their warmth and hospitality left a lasting impression on us and our families.

Also a special mention to the chef at w15. Every meal was exceptional, from warm, fresh pastries in the morning to multiple course meals. The food was definitely a highlight.

Finally, a heartfelt thank you to Sidath and the management team for their coordination with our event planners and the Hilton food and beverage team to bring our vision to life.

Upon arrival, we got a warm, traditional welcome before being guided to our amazing villa with a private plunge pool. The place was clean, spacious, and overall incredible. 

The staff's hospitality was unmatched. Amazingly helpful and friendly. We felt like royalty! Some of these people felt like family and friends, even after just having met them. 
 The food is fresh, tasty and of high quality, with a variety of options. We definitely recommend booking the authentic kamatha dinner. Romantically located in the middle of a rice field, the lovely staff cook and serve a Sri Lankan dinner with an abundance of rice, curries and other tasty dishes. Everything is cooked in the authentic kitchen, which they give you a tour of. An amazing experience to never forget! 

The hotel offers plenty of activities. We rode the bikes that came with the villa to explore the property, spotting monkeys and peacocks and taking in the lush nature and rice paddies. Another big plus was the kayaking experience. In the early morning, we had the chance to immerse ourselves in the serenity of a lake filled with colourful water lilies popping up at the surface. This was truly out of a fairytale.

This hotel is a place to never forget. We would recommend it to everyone. Thank you to all of the staff who've made this stay so wonderful.

While every visit of our many visits has etched fond memories, we felt that the resort had subtly elevated its already impeccable standards.
 
Much of this, we realised, stems from the remarkable team, led with confidence and humility by GM Dimuthu. From the seamless service to the genuine hospitality that enveloped us throughout our stay, Ulagalla was special.
 
One of the aspects we noticed was the resort’s strides toward greater gender balance. It’s incredibly refreshing to be welcomed by smiling, attentive staff who consistently went above and beyond—not just as part of their job, but with a warmth that felt sincere and personal. And dressed elegantly, always in fresh attire.
 
Front Office Manager Dilrukshi, whom we have fondly known from our past visits along with other heads of divisions, brought that signature Uga touch that defines a world class luxury resort.
 
 A pleasant surprise as we were about to leave was the handwritten note delivered in a sealed Uga envelope by Thilini in the restaurant, asking us to open it only after we leave. The touching contents of the note said it all about the humility of the staff.

A city sleeps in ruin and stone;

I had one of the best deep tissue massages I've ever had with Dina at the spa and enjoyed learning about the local communities during my scenic drive excursion.

The 58-acre property is a testament to thoughtful design, featuring nature-friendly villas with all the luxury amenities, paddy fields, farmhouses, natural vegetation, kayaks, and stables with horses. With such a diverse range of activities, boredom is simply not an option here. 
Waking up to the symphony of different bird calls and the sight of peacocks, squirrels, and monkeys, one can start the day with a horse ride in the paddy fields. The unique dining experience in Kamatha, a dining area set in the heart of a paddy field, is a highlight not to be missed. I had the opportunity to indulge in a culinary journey, with the curry leaves chutney being a standout. The hotel's commitment to authentic Sri Lankan flavors is evident in the use of hotel grown and ground spices.  The hotel caters to vegan and vegetarian diets.
Hospitality and the service of the staff are among the outstanding highlights of our stay. Staff goes out of the way to ensure comfort and make the stay uncomfortable. We had a viper encounter, and the buggy driver went over and above to take care of everyone’s safety.  
Uga Ulagalla is built on the pillars of sustainability. The hotel's commitment to the local community is evident in its employment of local staff and its support of local farmers by purchasing their vegetables, fruits, and rice. Hotel is committed to provide a lifeline to the local community. 
Finally, Uga Ullagalla is a platform to convey the Sri Lankaness to the world.","The best stay.","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2335977-d1876504-r1003211009-Uga_Ulagalla-Thirappane_North_Central_Province.html",

A special thanks to Tinusha who looked after us right from our delightful welcome. The whole team however were exceptional throughout. 

The food is out of this world and served in a lovely open first floor area looking out over the pool and fields. We also dined alongside the paddy fields at the Kamatha one evening sampling over 25 Sri Lankan dishes in the most amazing setting. Something not to be missed.

The location is secluded yet has easy access to many of the historic sites. The highlight for us has to be Lion’s rock which we visited early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds. A sensational place to visit. 

The accommodation is spacious, very well equipped and spotlessly clean. We enjoyed the buggy rides to and from the main building. We also rode around both the site and local tanks (reservoirs) on the bikes provided taking in the magnificent scenery and wildlife (peacocks, monkeys, mongoose…)

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","We spent 7 nights at Uga Chena Huts on an all inclusive basis booking via Emirates Holidays.  Very relaxed place to be and rather informal which we appreciated.  Situated on  a picturesque beach  (not suitable  for swimming) and  adjacent to  Yala National Park. Plenty of wildlife to see within the parameters of the hotel itself, hence the need to have a Ranger with you when walking the beach.  Cocktails and nibbles available daily at sunset from a beach bar. The Huts are nestled in the bushes , provide privacy, are spacious, luxurious and kept  immaculately clean with everything you would need, including laundry service.  Private decks are large and  have a shower ,  and each hut has its own jacuzzi- swimming pool.  We stayed in Hut 2 on arrival  for three nights and had lots of wildlife visitors throughout the day and night, especially monkeys which we immensely enjoyed watching . We moved to Hut 1 just to get an ocean view.  Not so many wildlife  visitors  to Hut 1 though an elephant did walk along the beach on our last evening!.  
Mini bar was free and well stocked though the  wines left a lot to be desired!!. Room was serviced twice a day.  Bed is enormous and extremely comfortable. Wifi is good and reliable. We used the hotel pool  and the spa facilities and thoroughly enjoyed them. 
The staff are  all exceptional. Every member of staff was  pleasant, polite, and couldn't do enough for you.  The food is extremely good, imaginative dishes, varied menu, quality,  fresh local  ingredients  and a chef who takes pride in what he produces.  What lets the restaurant down is the wine that is available. It's terrible, poor quality and limited choice  and not befitting of a 5* hotel or the fabulous food the chef produces.  We did mention it and we hope something is done to rectify this .  
We had the services of an excellent knowledgeable Ranger for our five safaris and we also visited Sithulpawwa Temple with him. He also took us   to a local fishing village and  on  a beach walk  in the vicinity of the hotel.  We saw everything we wanted to  on the Safari's and thoroughly enjoyed them. The hotel provides a picnic for each trip too.  
We would highly recommend this place.","A"" MUST GO TO "" destination!!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1011640995-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Nestled between the lush Yala jungle and the sparkling Indian Ocean, this luxury eco-resort effortlessly blends nature with elegance — and every moment we spent there felt like a dream.

The Vibe:
There’s a peaceful energy throughout the property — calming, rejuvenating, and full of soul. You’re surrounded by nature, but the comfort is uncompromising. The thatched-roof villas are spacious, beautifully appointed, and come with private plunge pools and outdoor decks where you can hear the jungle hum around you. It’s luxury in its most natural and refined form.

The Food & Gastronomy:
The culinary experience at Uga Chena Huts is second to none. Every meal was a celebration of Sri Lankan flavors, with an exquisite touch of international flair. From freshly caught seafood to fragrant local curries, each dish was crafted with care, creativity, and authenticity. A special thank you to Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara from the main restaurant, whose attentive service and warm smiles made every meal feel like a five-star experience — their hospitality was as unforgettable as the food itself.

The Safari Rides:
The game drives into Yala National Park were beyond thrilling. Our friendly ranger Sandun was not only incredibly knowledgeable but also genuinely passionate about the wildlife and the land. He brought the jungle to life with fascinating stories and insights, and we were lucky enough to witness some breathtaking animal encounters, including the majestic Sri Lankan leopard.

The Bar & Lounge Experience: Best smoothie ever, so do the cocktails.
Evenings at the lounge were something we looked forward to every day. Whether it was a craft cocktail or a custom creation inspired by local flavors, the bartenders never failed to impress. Huge thanks to Sathish and Nuwan, whose skill and charm behind the bar turned each drink into a celebration. Their energy and attention to detail added a vibrant and fun touch to our nights at Uga.

The Front Office & Service:
A very special thanks to Deshan and Dasun his front office colleagues at the front office who always pick us from buggy and guide us always — your kindness, constant support, and genuine care truly made us feel at home oh that sarcasm 😉 . From organizing our experiences to ensuring every detail was perfect, Deshan went above and beyond for us every step of the way. The entire front office team was friendly, efficient, and always ready with a warm smile — the true embodiment of Sri Lankan hospitality.

Final Thoughts:
Uga Chena Huts is more than just a luxury retreat — it’s a heartfelt experience where nature, comfort, and people come together in the most beautiful way. Thanks to the incredible team — especially Deshan, Sathish, Nuwan, Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara — our stay was filled with unforgettable moments, amazing flavors, wild adventures, and genuine human connection.

We may have forgotten some of the names who helped us throughout our stay. Cheers to all of them.

I can’t fault our stay at all. The hotel is located in a beautiful part of the park with dramatic sea views that the hotels architecture makes the most off. 

The food was some of the best we’ve had at hotels in Sri Lanka.

Rooms are luxurious (the bed is insanely big and comfortable) and feel at one with nature, whilst also doing a good job of keeping the bugs/animals outside and sound proofing against nature! Having a pool right outside was a nice bonus in the heat. 

We visited the spa for massages in between safari rides and the massages were excellent! Definitely recommend a visit to the spa if you can. 

Our safari rides were amazing and we were fortunate enough to see the elephants and leopards! The hotel sends you out in small groups with their extremely knowledgeable rangers who are respectful of our comfort and of the national park and animals. 

Going out on safari with ranger Jabaya was the highlight, you could tell he really cared about the animals and about ensuring we had a good safari. Ultimately it’s all down to luck as to what you will and won’t see but his knowledge of the park and animal behaviours certainty helped us to see some amazing animals. 

The hotel had lots of little touches, like the snacks provided during the safari trips, and the sundowner session (beach front cocktails and canapés before dinner) which really helped to make the stay special.

But there is wildlife around the huts so you have to stick to the rules. ","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights here with 5 safaris. Everything about our stay was perfect. We feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to have experienced Uga Chena. Firstly every member of staff will do anything to make sure your stay is beyond perfection. There is nothing they wouldn’t do for you. I couldn’t single out anyone as everyone who helped look after my family was just so wonderful. I have to say though our safari guide Jayaba was just the GOAT (my sons word!) and our driver we renamed Lewis Hamilton with  the best hair in Sri Lanka was the absolute best. Our safaris were incredible ….. off the beaten track away from the crowds so we really felt that it was just us in the park. We could see all the wonders of nature in its true beauty. We were truly blessed. 

The food is exceptional. Again nothing is too much trouble. My son has a severe peanut allergy and everyone was so careful which we were so grateful for. The portions were perfectly sized. During the safaris they pack you a selection of yummy snacks and drinks. The banana bread is divine! 

The resort itself is so sympathetically built into its environment with the respect the animals need. The pool area is lovely secluded to not attract any animals with attentive staff ready to bring you a refreshing cocktail. Sundowners on the beach each evening with snacks and more cocktails. 

The safaris take place at 6am and you are usually back for 9:30 to enjoy breakfast. The afternoon safaris take place at 3:15 and you are usually back by 6 for sun downers. Try to embrace all of the nature that Yala has to offer as I was just as guilty of it but if you become fixated on just wanting to see a leopard you will miss how beautiful your surroundings are. 

The huts themselves are spacious and luxurious. UK plugs and voltage. Laundry is included up to 15 items per day. We went in April and it was very warm so light clothing was all we needed. There are ponchos in the safari truck. Khaki coloured clothing is recommended to keep the insects away. Shorts  and a t shirt are fine even in the morning. With trainers. My husband wore flip flops … you don’t get out so you don’t need to wear sensible footwear but if you did need to get out in an emergency the terrain is muddy and uneven.  You can go straight to diner as you are. Or you can change for dinner into something more glam if you prefer. It isn’t formal though. But I did put a dress on two nights! 

Four nights felt like the perfect stay. As the resort is worth experiencing so you can relax. With four / five safaris. Our safaris were totally private which we preferred. The safaris are bumpy but it’s so much fun … And exhilarating. The safari jeeps are covered so you don’t need a hat and it will blow away unless you have string. 

You won’t be disappointed if you choose to stay here. It’s a truly a bucket list all round experience. 

Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.","Natural paradise perfection","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1002047526-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Uga Chena Huts is in an incredible location, beachfront with amazing views of the Indian Ocean from the bar, restaurant and the magical evening sunset bar on the beach.

Service was exceptional in all parts of the resort; check in, meal service, bar service and housekeeping were all of the highest standard with friendly, professional and well trained staff. 

There is a great variety of cocktails, spirits, wine, beer and other beverages available from the all inclusive offering, and we found the meal quality for breakfast, lunch and dinner to be of a high quality, with dietary issues / substitutions no problem at all. 

Our hut was spacious, luxurious and everything was of a high standard. 

We did two safari drives and the vehicle, drivers and guides are great. As Uga Chena Huts is so well run, it was great on a morning safari drive having the ability to drive past the 100 odd safari jeeps lined up to get into Yala National Park and enter the park straight away. 

The great location ensured plenty of animal spotting even from the resort including monkeys and a sloth bear walking across the driveway. The highlight was sitting at the bar in the evening whilst sipping wine and watching a large elephant walk through the resort illuminated by the moonlight. 

We absolutely loved our stay, our only complaint was that we only stayed for two nights and wished we had of stayed longer!","Perfection - we did not want to leave!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1000204287-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

First of all, the warmth of the staff is really special. The smiles, the willingness to help. Mr. Dammika, F&B manager, was on hand to make sure everything was to our liking.  He took such care to chat with and listen to everyone. Superb customer relations. And kudos to the chefs. Gosh; we loved the food. The flavours, the variety, the freshness. Huge shout out to the housekeeping staff: our rooms were so clean and we slept like babies on those beds. Waking up to sunshine and palm fronds at our window was the best!
We've been to a lot of beaches, and this sand is so like silk under your feet...no jaggy rocks. Natural shade provided by the thoughtfully planted trees gave the place a relaxed vibe.
Added extras: an amazing sunset sail on a beautiful Catamaran, and a very romantic beach dinner a deux...the staff went above and beyond. We couldn't fault it. Fresh seafood...beautiful ambience...gorgeous table setting and torch light...excellent service from Kamran.
The GM, Mr. Ruan, should be proud of all his staff. Together, they gave us a memorable and relaxing week.

Our stay at The Argyle - Luxury Boutique Hotel was truly exceptional. From start to finish, their service was on a top-class level.

Even the day before our arrival, they called to update us about the weather conditions and the road situation near the hotel, which we really appreciated. It showed how much they care about their guests’ comfort and safety before they even arrive.

On the day we checked in, we received a warm welcome and were treated to a fresh, high-standard cinnamon tea that was perfect for helping us relax after our journey.

As we were guided to our room, the staff kindly explained where to find the restaurants and other services in the hotel. Once inside, they took the time to show us all the amenities in the room and how to request room service. Our room was beautifully decorated, adding a special touch to our stay.

The food was some of the most delicious we have tried anywhere—nicely presented and full of flavor. I would honestly give the food 10/10. There were so many different selections and styles to choose from.

Throughout our stay, the staff were always friendly, polite, and happy to talk with guests, making us feel genuinely welcome.

On checkout day, they surprised us with a lovely tea gift and a warm goodbye, which was such a thoughtful gesture.

This was easily one of the top 10 hotel experiences I have had in Sri Lanka. I truly hope the CEO and the whole team continue this wonderful standard of service in the future.

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with the same warmth and elegance that made me fall in love with the hotel the first time.
My room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and beautifully styled.

The staff deserve special praise for their genuine hospitality and attentiveness. They remembered my previous visit, which made me feel especially welcomed and valued. A special mention goes to the incredibly thoughtful staff. We were initially assigned an upper-floor room, but when they noticed that my father was having difficulty with the stairs, they promptly offered us a room on the ground floor without any hesitation. That level of attentiveness and care truly stood out and made our stay all the more comfortable.

On top of that, they surprised my sister with a lovely birthday gift during our stay, which was such a sweet and unexpected gesture. It made her day extra special and showed how the team at The Argyle goes above and beyond for their guests.

Dining was another highlight. Every meal was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

This was our 4th hotel in our tour of Sri Lanka. The Argyle is absolute luxury hidden in the tea plantations surrounded by fantastic scenery. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by the really friendly & helpful staff. We were showed to our rooms which were modern & immaculately presented. 

The pool area was modern, clean & the poolside staff were on hand to provide us with towels when we arrived. 

Food was a mix of buffet/table service, both were great. 

Part of our stay included “high tea” this was basically afternoon tea, it was amazing. Endless cups of local tea & great food with an amazing backdrop! 

If you have time, there is a great hiking trail of around 10k which loops around the local area. Well signposted. 

We were sad to leave the Argyle & it’ll be a hotel never to forget. The staff all came out & waved us off! A lovely little gesture. 

10/10 for the Argyle! Thank you to all the amazing staff who made our stay a great one.","Stunning Hotel, Amazing Location.","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612383-d15666018-r1011275889-The_Argyle_Luxury_Boutique_Hotel-Hatton_Central_Province.html",

All we asked for was an offbeat hill resort — and what a gem they found! We went in without reading a single review, and what unfolded was a truly unexpected and unforgettable experience.

Hatton itself is serene and untouched, but The Argyle elevates that charm to something magical. This resort isn’t built just with bricks and cement — it’s built with heart. The people here are what make it extraordinary. Every staff member, from the front desk to housekeeping, radiates warmth. Their motto, “to exceed expectations,” isn’t just a phrase — it’s a lived reality. Every interaction felt personal, every smile genuine.

We stayed in the Campbell Suite 444, hands down the best room in the house, with a breathtaking view of Adam’s Peak right from the bed. The wind howling through the hills at night adds a rustic symphony to your stay — a reminder that you're deep in nature, away from the noise of the world.

Our kids loved the warm pool, and we all swam in the rain and mist, wrapped in the chill of Hatton’s weather but embraced by the pool’s comforting heat. To top it off, the team surprised our son with a birthday cake — a beautiful, thoughtful gesture.
The rooms are spacious, well-maintained, and designed with taste and comfort. Every little detail is taken care of.

And here’s our kids’ verdict —
Place: 11/10 | Room: 11/10 | Service: 15/10 | Food: 10/10 | Staff: 20/10
(Yes, those are real scores from two very happy little travelers!)

If you’re looking for peace, comfort, luxury, and a soul-soothing experience in the middle of nowhere — this is the place. We left The Argyle with full hearts and memories to last a lifetime.

Highly recommended.

Luckily for us, we did not notice her.

Contrary to her description, we had a blissful time relaxing at W15 (occupying 2 rooms for 4 nights, I expect that's why children are welcome as well as couples who seemed to stay for only 1 or 2 nights only). We would highly recommend the hotel to couples or families. It feels like a home away from home in the most beautiful surroundings.

All the staff were delightful, and very kind to the children. Sherriff and Hastha were always ready to help and arrange wonderful activities. We also appreciated the turn down service and the lovely housekeeping staff.

The hotel has two expert naturalists, Banuka and Anju. We were really impressed by their knowledge and professionalism. They took us on a nature walk and also a hike. They were highly engaging and made the activities lots of fun and interesting for the children who otherwise could have got bored or tired in the heat.

The hotel location is perfect- very close to Kandy for visiting the city and also in the most beautiful and serene setting in the mountains, with spectacular views and immaculately kept grounds.

The design and interiors of the house are also stunning and very comfortable. We loved sitting on the wrap around veranda,  playing board games in the library and lounge, swimming in the pool and playing croquet on the lawn.","Serene, immaculate and welcoming","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r1001656189-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Our room and the property were beautiful, and the explanation of the excursions and dining was excellent. We were served by Sheriff, Prabod, Hastha and Navod who were wonderful. 

Just a couple of minor things I would change if possible:

- ordering food straight after a meal for the next meal is difficult, I found myself worrying I wasn’t hungry enough etc. I understand the need for this, but I couldn’t face the food I’d ordered for the time we’d requested both evenings and went to bed very full and a little uncomfortable. It would be nice to be able to choose later, or have a more casual approach to this.

- The property isn’t adult only, and in my opinion, should be. A family with 3 children were there when we were, and they were constantly shouting, screaming and running around. The property is very small and intimate, so it isn’t really possible to remove yourself, and it completely spoils the atmosphere. I was loving hearing the natural sounds and watching the view, and swimming in complete bliss. All of this was ruined once the children descended. We were having a lovely morning at the pool, but this was ruined when the family landed and the children were repeatedly jumping in and out, splashing and screaming. We therefore moved to the lawn but would have really liked the option to swim to cool down. Our room had a private part of the veranda which was wonderful and we dined there each evening; however the children kept running past really close to us somewhat spoiling it, and it didn’t feel private with them constantly staring at us. Fortunately a thunder storm came and sent them indoors. The parents seemed on edge the whole time, and I don’t know what was worse, hearing the children or the parents constantly berating them for being children. It would be easier all round if there was an age limit.

That being said, it’s a beautiful property and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Another thanks to the staff who were absolutely incredible.","Great, just a couple of minor tweaks would make it perfection in my opinion","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r1001398916-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Castlereigh bungalow has only 5 rooms so the atmosphere is one of a house party. The tall figure from Birmingham, the military man, the Belgian lyricist (or is he a detective), the motorcyclist with a ponytail  make quite a cast.  All of us in a bungalow built in 1925 with a vibe of the 20s, 30s and 40s inside. The bedrooms without AC but a fan is enough at the altitude of the tea plantation. 
It really is all inclusive with a first class chef and staff, Singh stands out as really knowing his profession. If you stayed for 6 days as we did you could easily leave with a Michelin man physique.  Food is Sri Lankan or European as you wish and jolly good. 
There is a pool and the pretty garden is well looked after.  We went to 3 of the other 4 bungalows and our second choice would be Teitsen. Castlereigh though seemed the most authentic and comfortable.

From the cottage as well as from the pool, you have a beautiful panorama : Castlereagh lake and Tea plantations. Service is amazing. You can visit the Tea plantation & The Tea factory with a guide, former Tea tester with more that 30’s years of expertise.

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Several people ( including a travel agent) told us that a 5 day stay at Ceylon Tea Trails would be too long. In fact we stayed for 6 nights and could happily have stayed even longer. I do appreciate that many people stop here on a tour of Sri Lanka, but I can also highly recommend it as a destination in its own right. We have been to Sri Lanka several times before and booked the 6 night walking package at CTT before moving to the coast for 5 nights. I booked directly with the company, which was very easy: they arranged car transfers from the airport and onward to Tangalle. If you are pushed for time and/ or happy to spend the extra, I would recommend trying the float plane as it would have saved us a lot of time, especially on the journey to the coast, which took about 6 hours.
The walking package gives you 3 nights in one bungalow then 3 nights in another ( in our case Castlereagh and Norwood), but we visited all the properties. The bungalows are all lovely, and staff are delightful.
The thing that really made the holiday for us was Dhanushka, our walking guide. We had him with us for three out of the six days. The first walk he took us on was probably the easiest- we walked from Castlereagh to Norwood (had lunch there) and walked back a different route. He took us on a wonderful walk from Castlereagh to Somerville (4 hours - we had a picnic lunch en route) - the distance between these two bungalows is not far but we walked a long way round, avoiding the road completely other than crossing the dam, and walking up high on the ridge. Beautiful views and very quiet. The last of the three was from Norwood to Tientsin ( 4 hours) - we took a packed breakfast and had lunch at Tientsin. Dhanushka showed us routes that we would have struggled to find on our own and was great company- he was also good at spotting wildlife etc. The walks are fairly easy with some decent hills . Trainers or walking shoes are fine. We really loved the walking and saw few people other than tea pickers and the occasional group of children playing cricket. We also had a tea tour with Bernard (highly recommended) and a planters lunch, which was lovely. We also got a heavenly foot massage after each walk, which was wonderful.
The bungalows themselves are spacious and well appointed. Food varied from good to outstanding , though the packed breakfasts/ lunches could have been a bit more exciting.
Things to know
It’s useful to have a small day pack for walking (D carried water and food for me, but it’s handy to have somewhere for sunscreen, lip balm, camera etc) and I would recommend taking swim suits so you can have a dip when you arrive at your destination.
Take light weight clothing for walking which dries quickly- I wore t shirts with a long sleeved linen shirt which was fine, or sportswear. 
If you can face carrying them, binoculars would be great to have too.
The bungalows tend to be very sociable with everyone gathering for drinks before dinner etc. we enjoyed meeting a lot of interesting people.
You can borrow leech socks, but unless it’s damp, they are not really necessary.
Service varied between the bungalows. It’s not always as polished as it could be. 
If you want anything booking, it’s worth being very specific and what you want and when. The day we moved to Norwood, we had requested a foot massage on arrival, but it was never booked because they weren't sure what time we were arriving. It was sorted out in the end, but it did show a staggering lack of initiative given that we were with D all day and so easily contactable. That would really be my only gripe in an otherwise fabulous stay.","Wonderful Walking holiday","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r995397540-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

This review cannot possibly do justice to the Ceylon Tea Trail bungalows. 

We stayed at the Ceylon tea trails bungalows for four nights. Norwood for two nights and two nights at the Dunkeld bungalow

The Norwood Bungalow was exquisite. The opulence is everywhere. If you want to be spoilt this is the place for you. Stupidity I didn’t get the names of the staff but they were excellent from the workers behind the scenes to the butler and the waiting staff. The chef produces food that is fabulous. Try the afternoon tea it’s brilliant. 

Our days at the Dunkeld bungalow were very different than Norwood but again 5 star. Our butler and waiter (Krishna and Samantha) were excellent a special mention has to be made to the chef Ravi at Dunkeld. The food he produced was unbelievable. Ravi cooked us a BBQ on our last night. It could have fed 20 people. The food was extraordinarily fabulous. Just far far too much 😂

Overall impressions of the Ceylon tea trails the best travel experience of my life. If you do go make such you take the opportunity to go for a trek. The walk is not far and it’s at a leisurely pace. Our guide Kith showed us many species of birds which we would never have seen had we been on our own. We have travelled a lot over the years this accommodation was probably the best we have stayed at.

we also walked to the Castlereigh bungalow as well. This accommodation was definitely at the same standard as Dunkeld and Norwood. 

I would thoroughly recommend these bungalows.","Bungalows at the Ceylon Tea Trails","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r994132000-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

Chandrasuriya was there in the morning serving tea and coffee in our room, and mixing cocktails in the drawing room at night.  Always a joy to see his friendly face.

There are places you visit... and then there are places that live on in your heart long after the journey ends. My stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle was, without a doubt, one of the latter—a soul-soothing, heartwarming experience that lingered well beyond the check-out date.

Please forgive the delay in sending this note; due to the whirlwind of a demanding schedule, I was unable to share my reflections sooner. Yet not a single day has passed without fond memories rising gently to the surface—the sound of waves echoing through the palms, the taste of spice-laced southern cuisine, and the unforgettable warmth of your team’s hospitality.

From the very first moment I arrived, I was enveloped in a sense of serenity and grace. The resort didn’t just meet expectations—it quietly, elegantly redefined them. There’s a rare kind of magic at Anantara Peace Haven—one that lies not only in its sweeping views of the Indian Ocean or its lush, fragrant gardens, but in its people. It is your team that turns luxury into something profoundly human.

I must extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Ms. Thisari Nawoda, whose leadership and attentiveness infused every element of my stay. Ms. Thisari is not only a consummate professional but also a true ambassador of Sri Lankan hospitality. Her ability to anticipate needs, resolve requests with poise, and engage guests with genuine warmth is a gift few possess. It was clear to me that she doesn't just manage a resort—she nurtures an experience. Her quiet presence seemed to ripple through the team, creating an atmosphere of calm attentiveness and joy.

To the incredible staff, whose names I wish I had written down one by one, you each made me feel as though I were the only guest on the property. From the gentle housekeepers who maintained my villa with care and respect, to the smiling faces at breakfast who remembered my coffee preferences without being told twice, every detail felt personal. Not scripted, not rehearsed—real.

What truly stood out was the flexibility and thoughtfulness offered during my stay. Despite arriving with a somewhat unpredictable schedule and changing needs, your team never once made me feel like an inconvenience. Whether it was adapting meal times, arranging transport at odd hours, or simply offering a quiet space for me to catch my breath, your collective grace was unwavering.

The villa itself—an oasis of comfort—was designed not just to impress, but to restore. The harmony between refined architecture and natural beauty created a space that felt both elevated and grounding. Every sunrise I watched from that private terrace was like a quiet promise that all would be well.

And the cuisine... what a journey that was! Each meal was a celebration—vibrant, soulful, rooted in the local soil yet layered with creativity. Your chefs are not merely cooks; they are storytellers, serving chapters of southern Sri Lanka on every plate. I felt nourished not only in body, but in spirit.

As I look back, what touches me most is that Anantara Peace Haven never tried to “impress” in the way many luxury resorts often do. Instead, you chose to connect—to the guest, to the land, to the moment. And that is where your true magic lies.

Please accept my sincerest thanks, not just for the unforgettable stay, but for the way you made me feel—seen, cared for, and at peace.

To Ms. Thisari Nawoda and every team member whose efforts made my stay so special, thank you. I carry your kindness with me.","A Long Overdue Note of Heartfelt Gratitude","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1013083516-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

We were assigned Kaush, who was on top of everything whether it was food orders or safari bookings. 

There are a host of activities throughout the day which are complimentary and one of the best experiences was the morning nature walk with Rashmi; a marine biologist who does discovery tours working with the resort. She guided us through all the flora and fauna and had our six year old fascinated throughout. 

There is a lagoon snaking through the resort which you can boat ride on, which was also magical.

It was honestly some of the most delicious food I've tasted with regards to this cuisine. We stayed at the Beach Pool Villa and were given our own Personal Butler (Tharanga), who I already knew from my previous visit. Tharanga was always helpful and such a gentlemen, he would always try to accommodate to all our requests or find the best alternative solution.

A horse ride one morning around the estate and out to the lake and village was wonderful, a gentle walk on Rolex, a lovely horse who likes his palm leaves!

Very varied selection of food on offer for lunch and dinner, over the course of a couple of days our choices included meaty prawns, though a little light on taste; good pork ribs, though a little fatty, and the pak choi they were served with was inedible - very stringy; reasonable fillet steak; very good fish, prawn and squid tempura with a dressed salad.

Everyone we encountered here went above and beyond to be helpful. In particular, my dietary restrictions were significant and were expertly handled by the management, chef and kitchen. Beautiful gluten free bread and muffins and food prepared with no onion and garlic. A HUGE THANK YOU! We did dine at Kamatha and Diluka prepared a Sri Lankan feast according to my restrictions- and it was spectacular! That was a true highlight of our trip!! 

Our room was #1, which was hugely convenient as we could easily walk to meals and the pool. The villa was enormous and beautifully appointed!!! Also, everything seemed new! We did relax around the pool a few times- often just a few people there. And such a relaxing setting. 

We did take the guided bicycle ride through the village - hugely fun and insightful. The setting of this resort is just beautiful!! And close enough for day tours. 

We loved our time at Uga Ulagalla and were sad to leave. It is a first class resort in a beautiful location with a staff that is really a credit to its brand.

Es precioso... estuvimos en habitaciones con vista a la playa y era un lujo de comodidad, y de vistas.
La comida es algo increible... El desayuno super completo y agradable y la cena a la carta pero como si fuera un menú degustación con un montón de platos  para ir disfrutando. Un nivel de presentación y de calidad muy alto. Los niños tienen una gran variedad en el menú infantil pero también pueden pedir a la carta de los adultos si lo prefieren. 
El único inconveniente fue  la lentitud en la cena, que tardaban mucho en sacar los platos... pero valía la pena la espera. Cenamos las dos noches al aire libre al lado de la piscina y el ambiente es super agradable. 
La piscina que tienen es preciosa y de tipo infíniti, así que te bañas viendo el mar que lo tienes detrás.... 
Hubo música en vivo (pianista tocando) y el personal super amable todo el tiempo. 
Tienen un chiringuito para comidas, que está mirando al mar y se come muy bien y agradable con la brisa marina... 
La playa muy muy vacía y bonita... la disfrutamos mucho y cogimos padel surf y canoas para divertirnos con los niños.

In details: We have been to Uga Bay for about two and half weeks and enjoyed everything from the beginning to the end of our vacation! It is really a first time in our experience that the personal is listening to any of the client needs fulfilling these and trying to go a kind of extra mile. The hotel area was really clean, the beach and the pool as well (Eg the rooms have been cleaned three times a day). Around hotel and on the beach there was a security who has taken care of the surrounding area ensuring a really good filling of safety forcing not thinking about the things like keeping mobile phone or like unattended. The food (incl. buffet) was really delicious and manifold. During the breakfast or dinner time the chef came to our table and asked for extra wishes of our children subsequently fulfilling these. The ocean water on the beach seemed to be clean. In general according to the several local opinions it is one of the most beautiful bays on Sri Lanka. Eg one day during our vacation the president of Sri Lanka was just swimming there. Dear Uga Bay thank you a lot for that incredible experience.","Amazing vacation in the paradise.","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1003128355-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Anura looked after us at the main bar and Rakshini made sure she kept our favourite table always available.

Izmath - one of the head chefs came to our table multiple times and made sure the food was to 10-star standard.

Our beach in Uga Bay was cleaned every day, the security was watching so that no one left entered our territory. All hotel workers are friendly, they will always wish you a good day or a pleasant dinner, special thanks to the man at the reception (I don’t remember the name) who helped us move to another room when one became available. As for food, we had breakfast included, at the egg station at the entrance the cook cooked a very tasty omelet and rice pita (my love), for dinner I would like more days like the ""Buffet"", when you choose a variety of dishes and this dessert bananas with chocolate will forever be in your heart.

Upon arrival we experienced a warm and refreshing welcome.  The rooms are well appointed with everything you need. One of the highlights of the stay was a brilliant experience at each meal time.  Sajeevu, Nisankar, Ismoth, Santha, Rumesh. Shan, Dasun, the talented chefs,  and the F&B team were outstanding!  The beach is perfectly clean, with loungers and towels really.  The green space on the grounds lush tropical and well maintained.
As always the product, service and delivery of the experience starts at the top.  The GM, Neeranjan runs an excellent operation, smooth and efficient.  Thank you for making our stay enjoyable and memorable.  It is now one of my favorite hotels to stay at.","AMAZING!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1000702394-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Food was outstanding we ate in the restaurant every night, set menu gave lots of options and variety each night, the food was always tasty and high quality! The buffet was only available a couple of nights but both times plenty of choice, delicious and top quality food. We also ate in the beach restaurant most days which was great value for money and food and cocktails delicious! Beach was regularly cleaned so it was immaculate, white sands and clear blue water, ideal for swimming! Pool was spacious and clean and we made good use of this too! The staff are a credit to Uga, there was not one person from the gardeners through to reception staff who wasn’t pleasant and polite, always with a friendly welcome and smile, the service was absolutely outstanding.

Es ist ein tolles Hotel. Das UGA BAY hat einen Traumstrand. Zusätzlich gibt es einen neu renovierten Infinity Pool. Die Zimmer sind groß, sehr sauber und haben Meerblick. Die gesamte Hotelanlage ist sehr gepflegt. Das Essen ist einfach fantastisch.
Das UGA BAY ist für uns etwas ganz Besonderes. Wir erlebten Ruhe und eine Freundlichkeit, die von innen kommt. Es wurde alles dafür getan, dass wir uns richtig wohlfühlen. Alle waren ständig dabei, uns alle Wünsche und Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen. Dieser Service kommt von innen heraus und ist die DNA dieses Hotels. 

Wir haben eine solche Freundlichkeit und einen so tollen Service bislang noch nirgendwo erlebt. Wir hatten einen Traumurlaub!

Eigentlich wollten wir keine Namen nennen und niemanden hervorheben, da wirklich alle einen fantastischen Job gemacht haben. Trotzdem möchten uns wir besonders bedanken bei Pratheep, Munas, Ramani, Nissanka für einen unvergesslichen Service und insbesondere auch bei Lakmal und dem Küchenteam, die uns jeden Tag aufs neue verwöhnt haben.

Trotz aller Superlativen gibt es aber auch einen Punkt, der nicht zum Gesamtbild dieses Hotels passt. Das All Inclusive Paket enthält nur eine sehr eingeschränkte Auswahl von Cocktails, Säften und Softdrinks. Weiter sind Getränke der Minibar kostenpflichtig. Das passt aus unserer Sicht nicht und sollte nachgebessert werden. 

Ganz lieben Dank an das gesamte UGA-BAY-Team !
Wir werden im nächsten Jahr wieder kommen.","Abschalten und genießen – Service und Kulinarik auf allerhöchstem Niveau - ruhiges Hotel mit fantastischem Strand","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1000441475-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Die Wahl viel unter Anderem auch auf das UGA Jungle Beach Hotel, was perfekt dafür geeignet war! Das Hotel ist zwar hochpreisiger, bietet aber auch einen gewissen Gegenwert dafür. Die Lage ist am Besten als ""irgendwo im Nirgendwo"" zu beschreiben. Es liegt an einer Strasse nördlich von Trincomalee. Im Kreis von ein paar Kilometern gibt es so gut wie nichts.

Wir wurden freundlichst empfangen, unser Zimmer war zirka 1 Stunde vor offizieller Checkinzeit bezugsfertig. 
Unser 1. Zimmer ""LagoonView 42"" war noch umrenoviert, aber in Ordnung. Einzig die Klimaanlage war relativ laut und nachfolgend durch Defekt auch der Grund, warum wir noch in  ""JungleCabin27"" umgezogen sind welches gerade frisch renoviert war.  JungleCabin Zimmer sind einwenig größer in eigenen Häusern, Lagoon Zimmer haben ein Zimmer im Erdgeschoss und eines im Obergeschoss je Gebäude. 

Wir hatten Allinclusive gebucht, da das Hotel im Nirgendwo lag, eine gute Wahl, obwohl auch Halbpension gereicht hätte. Aber man gönnt es sichSämtliche Mahlzeiten AlaCart mit genügend Auswahl (Diner täglich wechselnde Karte) und IMMER optisch und geschmacklich perfekt.

It has a unique setting. Each suite has a very private feel surrounded by lush vegetation. It is great to be able to walk to the edge of the grounds and look down on the sea though there is a strict no go area onto the beach due to the danger of the sea and at night the potential of wild animals. We took a day safari into Yala National Park. Our ranger from the hotel was Dush who was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and  tried to enable us to see all our top requests. The driver was particularly skilled and between them we could not have had a better team. Due to a monsoon downpour we did not see a Leopard but that only means I will have to return to this wonderful hotel.

Everything from the moment you check in to the moment you leave is excellent.  They don’t stop feeding you and the food is first class. They also try to collect you and deliver you everywhere you want to go by golf cart so you don’t even need to walk anywhere!  Even though each ‘hut’ has a plunge pool  we used the hotel pool one morning and we were the only guests there.  It was shady and monkeys were playing in the trees for a while when we were there so it was even better.  We wanted a drink and nobody was about so we asked in the spa and a member of staff was immediately dispatched to the pool area and stayed there until we left!
Only one very small point. The lighting in the hut is quite subdued which is fine most of the time, except as a lady when you are trying to get ready to go to dinner.

The “huts” are expensive but worth every cent.  Cuisine (including vegetarian needs!) and choice of beverages were remarkable. There was one comment concerning toilet privacy which is true, but that can be avoided by the partner going for a swim in your own pool. 

It would be unfair to name one member of the staff for his work as they all worked together as a team and were always in for a joke. The safari tours are a must even if you don’t get to see the leopard or the famous tusk elephant, the guides and the drivers are enthusiasts all the way. Thanks.

We stayed at Una Chena Huts for 8 nights and it was absolutely fabulous.
As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff and offered a beautiful welcome drink. I knew we were going to have an amazing holiday.
One of the best holidays I have ever experienced.
The huts are beautifully appointed villas with a large pool.
The room is huge, with  a fully stocked mini bar, a massive comfortable bed, The toiletries are plentiful and there is a separate very large toilet and separate shower.
Our villa had a view of the lake where we would see our resident water buffalo who I named Bert every day just wallowing in the water keeping cool.
Every evening at 6pm we were invited for drinks at the sundowner bar on the beach overlooking the beautiful ocean.
The restaurant served amazing silver service breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The choice of food was fabulous with a choice of 4 course European  or Sri Lankan specialties.
The chef would come and say hello during dinner to ensure the meal was satisfactory.
During  our stay we were visited by an elephant walking to reception, an elephant on the beach who made his way to the restaurant and reception. Monkey family enjoying the freedom of the resort.
One particular evening on returning to the villa from a night enjoying fabulous food and drinks we were greeted by Bert our water buffalo on the porch of our villa munching on the greenery and when he was full he wandered behing our villa of our villa.
Uga Chena Huts have a fabulous team of guides who arrange and take you on the safaris. We were lucky to be offered 2 safaris a day one early in the morning and one late afternoon.
Our guide Kalihdu was absolutely fabulous, his knowledge was exceptional. He was super friendly and changed our route through the park every day.
We were so lucky to watch a leopard just chilling in the bush who then decided to sit in front of our 4x4 just relaxing and cleaning herself for 5 minutes then we had the same experience with an elephant.
It was surreal seeing these beautiful animals in the natural habitat.
The animals we saw were leopards, elephants, water buffalo’s, monkeys, crocodiles, deer and an amazing array of birds.
All the staff at Una Chena Huts are absolutely fabulous. Leezel Daniel The resident manager must be so proud of all her staff. They were exceptional, always had a beautiful smile and going above and  beyond to ensure our stay was unforgettable.
Una Chena Huts is paradise and we will definitely return.","AMAZING FABULOUS UNFORGETTABLE","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r994209477-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The room was such a great respite after the crazy Yala drives. So much space to sprawl out. Such a comfy bed and pillows. Great shower and pressure. The deck with pool was lovely and really enjoyed hearing the waves from the ocean and the birds. Only criticism is the toilet room - it needs a roof for privacy - no one wants to hear their loved  one’s issues going on in there! 

The service was spot on! They worked so hard to make eveyone happy and cared for. A shout out to Janith our ranger - he was so knowledgeable and made the drives fun and tailored them to my needs after I said no more bumpy “main road” of Yala - so helpful! (And on that note make sure to book Spa appointments! Your sore body will thank you after those safari drives) Tea in the spa was excellent! 

The food - amazing! Always ready to cater to our needs when we needed to change it up because of preferences. I will remember the fluffy truffle eggs from breakfast forever!! Best breakfasts I’ve ever had. And the quantity of food - you will never go hungry - ever! I had to start just having soup for lunch to save room for Safari snacks which is actually just lunch to go - and so good to! 

I can’t say enough or praise the property and people enough - wonderful in every sense. Oh and an elephant even made a visit to the car park where you board the safari vehicles as well as wild boar to top it all off!

You definitely won’t go hungry with their 4 course meal service, sundowner specials on the beach (happy hour drinks + appetizers) and many desserts!

When you find the place it is a long dirt track from the main road (which is quite normal in Sri Lanka) and Uga Chena is at the end past the Hilton, Cinnamon and a couple of other places down this road.  

So glad we picked the Uga Chena though as we could not fault it.  From the amazing HUGE room to the warm, friendly, helpful, brilliant team working there.  Uga have a few hotels throughout Sri Lanka and they vary greatly in price and facilities, Uga Chena is up there on price, but what you get is unparalleled and we had quite an adventure just in our 3 days there.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed most warmly and felt at home straight away.  As we walked to the restaurant a monitor lizard was fishing in the pond and caught a fish which was amazing to watch.  

The restaurant is small and intimate with aircon indoor seating and covered outdoor seating available.  There is an outdoors bbq where some items are prepared - the food is freshly prepared each day and the menu changes dependent upon what they have fresh that day.  My favourite was the lobster and Kris’s was the steak. But the curries are all delicious.

We had a culinary demonstration which was a treat and the prawn curry chef cooked was delicious.  

The outside bar and ‘sundowner’ bar are a treat with the bar close to the restaurant and the sundowner out near the beach, the weather and animals do not always allow the sundowner to operate, so go there when you can.  

The room is simply amazing - you will not be disappointed.  The bed is enormous, you can both starfish.  toiletries and amenities are plentiful with separate toilet and shower (excellent pressure), large bath, twin sinks and great aircon. The minibar is well stocked and replenished whenever you wish.  Try the ‘whispering wall’ - if you both stand in opposite corners and talk quietly to the wall, you can hear perfectly - or better still surprise your partner with this knowledge when they are in the toilet :).

The room has an outdoor pool - this is not heated so brace yourself.  But the view from it is perfect.

Our personal experience was quite the adventure even for just 3 nights that we were there.  We had 3 safaris booked and were paired with a very warm and friendly Australian family who we made friends with straight away.  Our Ranger ‘Gayan’ and his driver were absolute diamonds - so helpful and knowledgeable, spotting animals we wouldn’t even with binoculars. Our first trip out was leisurely until they received word of a possible leopard sighting - but it had gone when we got there.  On the way, we saw plenty though and were very happy with our journey.  Our second trip was early morning and we were treated the most magical hour or more when we saw a leopard taking a nap in a tree and watched her for as long as she sat there watching us, licking her paws.  

That night we were held hostage by an elephant who decided that the trees outside our villa were the best in Sri Lanka and we were unable to leave.  So we turned off the lights, made good use of the minibar and sat watching the magnificent beast as he completely ignored the rangers combined attempts to move him on.  We got to dinner about 9.30pm and could not have been happier!  We were treated to the brilliant service they offer none-the-less for our late arrival and the story of the elephant in camp was doing the rounds.  While we were at dinner, he moved on to the staff accommodation and they found themselves unable to go back till he had moved on - I hope they had a ‘lock-in’.  :) and enjoyed it.

Whilst we were there in January and the weather was a little against us with sporadic rain, we made the most of this magical place and the wonderful staff who looked after us.  On the morning that we were leaving, we went on a beach walk with our Ranger and our Antipodean friends and were again treated to the most magical walk on the beach.  We saw the recent prints of Leopard, Elephant, Sloth Bear and mongoose - all of which had travelled through camp during the night - incredible.  The most surprising was the sloth bear and it made up for not having seen him on our safari.  There are a couple of stray dogs here but they really don’t bother you.  

Animals we saw were:- Elephant, Leopoard, Buffalo, Boar, Chipmunks, Peacocks, Monkeys, Monitor Lizards, Gecko, lizards of all sorts, Birds too many to mention and crocodile.","Simply stunning","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r989559119-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Allerdings möchten wir den Service und die Menschen hervorheben, welche dem Hotel den letzten exzellenten Schliff verleihen!

Wir waren vom 28.12. - 31-12.2024 - im Rahmen einer eigens organisierten Rundreise - vor Ort und haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Gerne wären wir noch länger geblieben.....aber es gibt so viel Tolles in Sri Lanka zu erleben.

Zudem möchten wir insbesondere sehr positiv die Safaris erwähnen - wir haben jede dieser Möglichkeit genutzt und wir wurden belohnt. Deshalb waren wir ja auch hier - es war einfach grandios .... die Aufzählung an Tiersichtungen würde den Rahmen sprengen ;-) Und ja, Elefanten und Leoparden waren dabei!

Der Service und die Qualität - in vielerlei Belangen - haben wir bisher selten erleben dürfen! Nochmals einen großen Dank an das gesamte Team! Wir können niemanden hervorheben - we were falling in love with all of you!

Welcome drink and neck massage offered while checking in, exceptional 6-course tasting menu at the restaurant, breakfast served in the garden, cozy SPA with heated pool, steam bath & sauna, park with wonderful view over the valley.

It’s amazing. 

The traveling season is from June to December.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I stayed in this hotel for 02 nights and went there to celebrate our anniversary. I was amazed by the views and lovely beach by the hotel. The service and food was exceptional  too. 

The staff went above and beyond to create a memorable experience for us from room decorations to the anniversary celebration dinner which was arranged by the pool just for us.  The hotel has a really talented staff including chefs who prepared mouthwatering spreads for all our meals. 

Again, the food here is delicious and the hotel staff is fantastic. I wouldn’t do justice if I didn’t mention few names who made our stay much better. Dhammika (Restaurant Mgr), Mahinda (Restaurant Supervisor), Madushan, and Kavinda (Restaurant staff). 

I must say the rooms are so clean and tidy. It seems they pay extra attention to details. And it’s absolutely same with the hotel premises. The pictures here will tell more about what I described. 

I highly recommend this hotel to a couple or a solo trip. It’s very safe and there’s a huge pool for you to have a dip. We were so relaxed and happy, will definitely come here again.","Our anniversary celebration stay.

The staff and management were very accommodating to all of my remote work and cabin requests. They were happy to accommodate anything I asked to change. The hotel has a very natural common area with a pool, restaurant and bar area where I was able to work. The food was excellent especially if you enjoy seafood. The juice and deserts, jams and butter all made with fresh fruits and tasty ingredients. The staff was happy to give me as much food as I wanted and to taste and have small bites, could modify orders as I liked. I highly recommend this place for a true getaway into nature, away from city life. The naturalist Ashan was super genuine, knowledgeable and helpful about all sightseeing and nature excursions in Trincomalee and across Sri Lanka. He even helped me plan the rest of my trip moving to other cities. I arrived by cinnamon air from Colombo to Trincomalee airport which was super easy and fun, and Uga hotel sent me a driver to pick me up from the landing strip and take me to the hotel. There are lovely beaches, snorkeling and temples in the area which the hotel took me to, including seeing lots of amazing dolphins, turtles, colorful corals and fish. I loved how flexible it was every evening I would talk to reception and the naturalist and we found something fun and different that I could go do the best day according to my work/time off schedule. Staff and management super kind and nice.","The true nature experience in Trincomalee","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r1011460606-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

We had an incredible stay at Uga Jungle Beach for my 30th birthday. We stayed for 5 nights and the stay can be surmised into 3 points: exceptional service, exceptional food, premium feel.

The staff were all extremely friendly and no request was too difficult to sort. They work long hours and maintain the high quality consistently. A good example of their forward thinking was to do the room cleaning whilst you’re at breakfast and dinner so you don’t have the awkward moment returning to your room to find someone midway through cleaning!

We were half board and experienced a la carte dining. For each of our 5 days we had a different menu for a 5 course dinner (starter, soup, sorbet, entree, desert). Dishes were superbly prepared and presented and tasted superb. Breakfast was also an a la carte experience with juice options, 3 different dishes out of a large menu (we only ever had 2 as they were very filling).

On my birthday my wife surprised me with a sunset seafood bbq on the beach, organised by Uga. This was the main highlight of the holiday for me - the food was exceptional, both in quality and quantity (tuna, crab, lobster, prawns, cuttlefish, white fish, vegetables, rice etc) - we even got a private fire pit! They put lots of effort into the sand decorations too.

Only minor thing was the drinks were on the pricier end but that’s to be expected when travelling to a premium hotel. As a reference a lion lager (330ml) was around £5. We have been to restaurants / hotels where a 625ml bottle was £2. By UK prices £5 is still good. Be aware the menu prices are listed in USD - there is then a service charge (10%) and local tax (18-20%) on top of the listed price. At the time of writing this, the conversion to GBP means the listed price is basically what it costs in GBP when you add the service + tax.

We also chose to go on a guided cycling tour (3 hours - £32) with a private naturalist - this was around 20km and involved seeing many of the 400+ bird species in Sri Lanka (thanks Ashan!). If you like nature and the beautiful rice field landscapes then this excursion is a must do in our opinion.

On site itself there are so many varieties of wildlife - monkeys regularly sat above our balcony (Jungle cabin). We also do giant squirrels, crabs, 3 different species of kingfisher, loads of other birds.  

The beach is completely idyllic, we ran 2km either side and didn’t encounter another human being - it is fully secluded. The water is beautiful, calm, warm and there is a lifeguard on duty. We found that the water remained chest height up to around 15-20 meters from the shore so was ideal for paddling and swimming.

We hope to return in the future - thanks for the amazing stay.","Idyllic beach resort with exceptional food and staff","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r1011082254-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",

Das Ambiente ist atemberaubend. Das Gelände riesig, weshalb wir täglich mit dem Fahrrad durch diese wunderschön gepflegte Anlage, um ein satt grünes Reisfeld herum fuhren. 
Besonders und äußerst interessant war der Kochevent vom traditionellen Curry. 
Zuerst erhielt ich von Yoshina, der wundervollen, außergewöhnlich hübschen und freundlichen guest Managerin, die Möglichkeit einen traditionellen Sari zum Kochevent zu tragen. Ich fühlte mich sehr wohl damit und er sah wunderschön aus. Uns wurden zuerst die Kräuter und Gemüsepflanzen im schönen hauseigenen Garten gezeigt. Dann wurde gemeinsam gekocht. Der Koch  mit über 15 Jahre Kocherfahrung und die hilfsbereite Köchin waren fantastisch. Wir aßen hier wirklich das beste Curry auf unser 3- wöchigen Reise. Wir können diesen Event sehr empfehlen!!!
Beim Frühstück klauten uns Makaken-Affen 2-mal das Brot aus dem Körbchen, weshalb das grandiose Serviceteam uns während dem Essen beschützen 😂 wir nahmen es mit Humor. Wir haben unsere Zeit hier sehr genossen!!!

die villa mit pool, all die details im und ausserhalb des zimmers, die sauberkeit, der hohe standard der einrichtung (achtung, das himmelbett quietschte bei unserer villa!), die velofahrten über das riesige hotelgelände überzeugten ebenso, wie die persönlichkeit des teams.

überhaupt sind die tiere hier ein highlight: als schweizer ist man doch recht schnell überfordert, wenn einem pfaue, affen, streifenhörnchen (bei glück sogar ein elefant...), glühwürmchen, grosse echsen auf dem hotelgelände begegnen.

We did our nature walk with Rashmi and she was very passionate about the animals and marine biology surrounding the resort. Shane from Tropic Surf was very helpful to us. There are so many others that I can’t recall the names of, such as the individuals from the Spa, or from the restaurants or from the shops. But everyone was amazing to us.  The private beach is beautiful. The views from the clifftop are breathtaking. Having dinner at the El Mare or just hanging out on the clifftop during the sunset is stunning. The infinity pool is great. The overall design and preservation of nature within the resort is a marvel.  For kids, there is a kids club and a game room.

The rooms were very comfortable and had all the facilities we needed. Although the beach was a bit rough, we still enjoyed it. The pool was very relaxing and had ample space to swim around and chill.

Thisari was our host, and she was extremely helpful and clear with all her instructions. She was always reachable and assisted us in booking the nature walk and the canoe ride—which, to be honest, we might have skipped if she hadn’t convinced us. And what a great decision that turned out to be!

Suresh at the restaurant was also very helpful, friendly, and witty. He made sure we were having a good time and regularly checked if we needed anything. He even took our photos without any hesitation, which we really appreciated.

The nature walk was a lovely experience. Even though we are locals, it’s definitely a must-do—it gives you a fresh perspective on the surroundings and is also very informative. Konara, our guide, was punctual, friendly, and clearly passionate about what he does. Although he knew we were locals, he still made the walk engaging and interesting.

We stayed at six hotels over nine days in Sri Lanka and experienced the warm hospitality the country is known for, but the staff at Anantara were exceptionally generous with their time—and their sincerity felt truly genuine. 

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm ceremonial welcome. The check-in process and tour of the grounds were handled with elegance, and our room was clean with a lovely view. 

A special shoutout to Ms. Thisari, who made our stay truly memorable. She was not only helpful but also thoughtful with every arrangement, going the extra mile to ensure we were comfortable throughout.

Suresh, one of the staff at Journey Restaurant, was also a delight. He greeted us with the biggest smile each morning at breakfast and was always attentive to our needs. During one of our dinners, another member of the waitstaff (I’m so sorry I didn’t catch your name!) noticed my husband sneezing and offered to brew us a pot of black tea with ginger and honey. The tea was delicious, but what touched us most was the attentiveness and sincerity behind the gesture.

One afternoon, while enjoying in-room dining in our garden, a beautiful peacock came and stayed with us until we finished our meal. It was one of the most magical moments of our trip.

Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle exceeded all our expectations and gave us the perfect ending to our Sri Lankan adventure. Highly recommended!

Best,

They only arrive in the plantation area during the AM from Colombo",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This was our first visit to Sri Lanka, which we were looking forward to as part of our winter tour including Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and a return to the cold UK through Oman and Quatar.
Ceylon Tea Trails comprise five individual tea planter bungalows situated in the very beautiful mountain tea plantation area south of Hatton in Central Sri Lanka. It can be either easy to reach, or difficult dependent upon how you travel. The easiest route is to take the floatplane from Colombo airport. The aircraft touches down on Castlereagh Lake at 4,000 feet above sea level after about 30minutes flight time. The most difficult alternative is via road, taking between 4 and 5 hours dependent on conditions. If the mountain weather prevents visual air operations, then the only option available is the road journey. We were luckily able to make the journey by air and its truly spectacular. Descending into the valley the green velvet plantation tapestry is strikingly beautiful, this added an exciting and dramatic feature to our visit.
The planter bungalows are situated about 40minutes drive from one another, each with their own manager, butler, chef and service team. We had been assigned to stay at the Tiantsin bungalow, the original building of the five established in 1888 and named after the original town in China from where the first tea plants were imported. The area is steeped in colonial history from this period. During the journey from lake to bungalow we were fascinated to stop at the Anglican Christ Church of Warleigh and experience the original almost 200 year pipe organ being casually played by a fellow visitor, this brought quite an emotional sentiment. On  arrival at the Tiantsin the gardens display an array of colour, layed out and manicured resembling a Thames Valley English summer garden.
We were welcomed by our butler with a refreshing juice and introduced to our Chef who discussed our gastronomic preferences. The service here is all about providing a truly bespoke tailored experience. As the guest, you can set the time table and routine and the chef will volunteer the wide array of ingredients for the lunch and dinner, with afternoon tea in between should you wish.
The rooms are traditionally furnished and generally spacious with access to garden terraces. Curiously for me they had a familiar “Scottish” ambience. Internet connectivity functions well, despite an amusing absence of room telephone, such apparatus being replaced by a bedside call button. Using this retro technology one press for a couple of seconds and our butler would be at the suite entrance in moments to meet our needs.
During our three day stay we enjoyed walking along the plantation trails where we met many locals, we visited the Norwood Bungalow where their chef entertained us for a morning curry cooking course, and visited Norwood shopping street. We didn’t get time to enjoy the swimming pool and hot tub, but I did spend a relaxing afternoon with a Cuban cigar amongst the array of birdlife  in the garden, note its essential to bring your own cigars as they are not available for purchase anywhere in Sri Lanka.
Only suggestion we might make, and on a positive note would be to provide a modest wild flower arrangement within the room on arrival, perhaps adding a feminine touch. Could easily be sourced from the abundance of wild and cultivated flowers in the bungalow gardens.
As we depart for our next destination, Wild Coast Tented Safari Lodge, the striking elements of CTT are the quality of food and service which is to the level expected in a Michelin star establishment, served in a beautiful mountain area with very intimate personal service.
With thanks to the G.M. Chandana, Clement, and at Tiantsin our  Chef Jines, butlers Ajith and Nesa, and young room assistant Kesvan who ignited the log fireplace in our room each night, it’s been a travel experience we will remember for our lifetime.","Not to be missed for a gourmet traveller","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r989774427-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

Once you get out of Hatton (many, like us arrive from Sandy by train, getting off at Hatton which is a filthy place) the road winds up into the hills and the hotel itself is comprised of several different bungalows all similar but each with its own individual charm.  We stayed in Castlereagh which is by the lakeshore and we had lunch one day at Dunkeld which is about half an hour's walk up the hill (they will drive you if you don't feel like walking but for the active it is an easy and lovely walk). The TV programme was a little misleading. We thought that the bungalows would be set on a private estate and although separated by quite a distance in some cases, but we were not really expecting there to be so many villages and people also in the vicinity. It is not entirely tranquil and there can be quite a lot of noise from the extended call to prayer to some extraordinary noise if you happen to encounter a Buddhist festival. Fireworks into the night are quite commonplace. That being said it is a very charming place with lots of colonial (between the wars) feel and the service is superb. Monica Galetti's humorous ""Today's breakfast menu is..... whatever you want"" is also misleading. You have to decide what you want the evening before, whether Sri Lankan breakfast or Western. The food is, however, sublimed the level of service second to none. We only had two nights here and I think we could have had a week and not geo bored. From the serene swimming pool to the hot tub overplayed by a very proprietorial white bellied eagle the ambience was lovely. There were lots of birds to see in the garden and a kayak excursion on the lake was great. Thrown in is a complimentary tour of the the factory which is, after all, the whole raison d'être of the area. Picturesque, calm luxury is how I would best describe this hotel which actually feels more like a holiday cottage with staff than a real hotel.","Luxury with a very colonial feel.","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g27929191-d580009-r984999538-Ceylon_Tea_Trails_Relais_Chateaux-Lethant_Central_Province.html",

Thank you for your heartfelt review! We’re absolutely delighted to hear that you had a fabulous three-night stay at W15 and that our team made your experience so special.

It’s wonderful to know that you loved your spacious and spotless room, the peaceful surroundings, and the thoughtful touches like the anniversary cake and private dinner in the garden. Sheriff, Hastha, Prabod, and Navod will be thrilled to hear your kind words about their hospitality!

We’re also glad you enjoyed the wildlife adventure with Banuka—spotting leopard paw prints and learning about the local landscape must have been an unforgettable experience. And of course, the little comforts like the nighttime turndown service and hot water bottles make all the difference!

We have just left our stay at W15. Our room, number 2, was large, spotlessly clean with a separate shower and roll top bath, we had our own lounge and French windows opening onto our private garden. 

Nothing was too much trouble for all the team and we were looked after by an amazing team of butlers, Sheriff, Hastha, Prabod and Navod. They were wonderful and we cannot praise them enough. 

To celebrate our wedding anniversary they surprised us with a delicious cake. They also arranged a special dinner with a separate table for two in the garden for us. It was a lovely experience and one we will never forget.

We went out on a wildlife ride in their open top vintage land rover defender.. Our guide was Banuka and he showed us leopard paw prints and claw scratches on trees. He was very informative about the landscape, wildlife and local tea picking. 

Nighttime turn down service included a hot water bottle if you need it.

Few notes to improve

1. Would be nice if the e-bikes would be in working condition than being in manual mode. Some may appreciate the extra kick to ride back

2. The small ponds around the property could use some cleaning

My partner and I enjoyed a 4 night stay at W15 Hanthana Estate, and we already miss being there. This place really exceeded our expectations: The views are unbelievable, we spent hours just soaking it all in from different spots around the property. It’s the perfect place to come to stillness after lots of active travel.

The whole team made our stay wonderful, from the incredible food to the warmth of every interaction. We honestly wouldn’t have had the same experience without them. The butlers are amazing, anticipating our needs before we even realised them ourselves. Manjula is such a gem, bringing warmth, cheer, and genuine care in his service. Navod was also fantastic – he has a great sense of humor and made us feel right at home. A highlight of the stay was our morning hike with Naturalist Aju. His knowledge of the area’s nature but also history and culture made the hike more than a simple excursion (which in itself was gorgeous). Special mention goes to General Manager, Sidath, who went above and beyond with thoughtful touches throughout our stay. We felt like we were treated more like family than guests and hope to return with our family one day. ps.

Thank you for the absolutely heartwarming and beautifully detailed review! We are beyond thrilled to hear that your stay at W15 Hanthana was such a special and unforgettable experience for your entire family. From the misty valley views and sumptuous High Tea with Navod to the breathtaking hikes with Bhanuka and the once-in-a-lifetime wildlife encounters—including a rare leopard sighting!—it truly sounds like an adventure to cherish forever.

We love that your little explorers had so much fun hunting for treasure, spotting wildlife, and even mastering Sri Lankan cooking with Chef Rasika! And of course, unwinding with a G&T while the kids caught fireflies by the fire—what a perfect way to end the day.

Your kind words about Sidath, Navod, Bhanuka, Puvi, and the whole team mean the world to us, and we can't wait to welcome you all back for more magical moments. Thank you for sharing your experience—it truly captures the essence of W15 Hanthana!

The attention to detail, the staff who all went above and beyond and the sense of space and beauty Hanthana offered us was out of this world.  When we arrived in Hanthana (wife, myself; 11yo, 9yo & 5yo in tow) we were treated to not only a spectacularly misty view over the valley, but a sumptuous High Tea; expertly served by Navod who talked us through the variety of teas we could choose from. Obviously, being in the center of one of the most renowned tea areas in the world has its benefits! W15 were happy to suggest and organise a variety of trips for us and not only did the nearby town of Kandy have a wide selection of cultural trips to partake in (Notably the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple); but the surrounding wilderness offered stunning walks and experiences. Bhanuka, the hotel's resident naturalist took us on a wonderful hike up the mountainside, through the tea plantations. It was perfectly manageable for our 5 year old and I would highly recommend as he talked us through the flora and fauna and excited all 3 children with his stories. It was so good that our 5 year old had to be carried off the mountain as he was too busy looking for buried treasure! Another highlight was the 'Rock Bar' where Navod, our personal butler (!), Bhanuka and Puvi, took us up in the hotel's Land Rover Defender to explore some of the trails and find a local lookout where Navod expertly setup a portable bar to create cocktails and mocktails in the great outdoors. A wonderful setting for me and my wife to enjoy the peace and tranquility and a playground for the children who were busy building dens and hunting for crystals with Bhanuka.  It was like our own personal childcare in the wild!  A firm favourite with the children.   Our guides also spotted a range of wild animals including an eagle, a barking deer and a LEOPARD!  Apparently this was exceptionally rare!  Our final day saw Rasika, the Executive Chef, treat us to a cooking course of local curry dishes where the children took the reins and created a wonderful lunchtime spread. Whilst it was a wonderfully busy couple of days, it was always a pleasure returning to our rooms before the evening meal, being able to soak in the bath and then retire to the veranda for a G&T whilst the children caught fireflies and drank hot chocolates by the fires. So many other wonderful touches to these days - the idyllic pool, the visit to the Tea Museum, the gigantic treehouse swing overlooking the valley, the local tea menu and lobster for lunch.  The list is endess as these are only the highlights.  Fantastic. Many thanks to Sidath and the team, we will be back!","One of the most special and unique family experiences","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r995879308-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

I returned to this area after two decades of living outside of the country and I was blown away with what they have done, an unbelievable transformation but yet, very traditional, clam and serene. Took me straight back to that childhood and those lovely memories. 

If you want to experience what Sri Lanka is all about, I highly suggest visiting here. It's very close to one of the major tourist locations, ""Kandy Temple"" and you will really get the experience of living in a tea plantation. Take a plantation tour in their beautiful truck and you will be transported into a whole different world, filled with happiness and tranquility. The place is breathtaking and  friendliness of the staff truly is amazing. 

Manjula, Hastha, Navod and Prabad helped us through our stay and their commitment to make this place, our visit a memorable one is worth the mention.

Arrived to a personal welcome - placing flag of UK on the board to see the International appeal. The room was beautiful and very spacious - one of the 4 new rooms with own pool. 
Golf buggies whisk you from room to reception although it’s fine to walk during the daytime.  
We were assigned a butler who was always on hand and couldn’t do enough for us - the mini bar miniature wines didn’t quite cut it and appreciated the full size bottle exchange!
The chef needs special mention. Incredible food and very grateful to him for the curry cooking lesson. The blackened curries are superb. 
Drinks on the beach were a special treat at sunset (although a wandering elephant prevented this on night 2!) 
Special mention also for grilled lobster dish 
The general manager always attentive and friendly making sure everything just right. 
Rangers are very knowledgeable - ours qualified in S Africa
The safari drive also very well organised in excellent Toyota go anywhere vehicle - leopard eventually seen after much deep jungle road exploring ! The hotel even pays for “fast track” 
Any criticism ? Only one very minor- the all inclusive wine only just acceptable. For an extra £5-£10 a bottle purchase price could improve this as did let down the meal slightly. Think cloudy bay standard to really up the game

The management arranged a surprise sundowner for us on a secret beach with was a lovely touch.

This place is magical because of the team who both work within and who manage it. The new resident manager Nissanka is so approachable and cheerful and always around to talk about your day and how your stay is going. There is a new front office manager Druzelle who is an amazing addition to the team and like the Resident Manager she is always available and bright and cheery.

Our star as always is Vibushana who was once again our ranger for the third year running. He managed to find us some leopards on a safari and a bush walk and we loved his company.

Location, quality of the accommodation, staff, food, views, details, amenities, the safari guides and of curse the incredible wildlife and nature made every moment so, so special. It was truly the most remarkable experience.  
Uga Chena Huts is a collection of large half dome “huts” connected by elevated meandering path protected by thick vegetation.  The resort is located along a deserted beach facing the Indian ocean at the border of the Yala Wildlife reserve, one of the marvels of biodiversity of the world. 
The rooms are wonderful: large, unusual and architecturally interesting. The Huts all feature an open concept with large bathrooms, an incredibly spacious room filled with amenities, a wonderful deck (ours was overlooking the ocean) and a private plunge pool. During our stay we had a colony of playful, lovely monkeys living on the dome and we woke up to an elephant “nibbling” at the fresh leaves in the bushes right in front of our deck!!!!  It does not get any better than that. It was truly like living in a dream.
The restaurant and bar occupy two separate structures on the beach connected by a deck  with views of the Indian ocean. The food is very high quality, delicious and varied and the staff makes the place even more special.  
Everyone, from Indhi to the restaurant staff, was incredibly attentive, warm, welcoming and made us feel truly at home.  
Chena Huts has a team of naturalist guides on staff that lead the safaris. During our stay we took two safaris inside Yala with an exceptionally knowledgeable guide and super nice human! Yala is pure beauty.  Every corner, every view, every tree, field, lake and of course animal is just incredible and will leave you speechless. 
We saw leopards, elephants so close that I would have never imagined, a bear (!), water buffalos, deer, toucans, all sorts of birds, wild boars…..it was simply the adventure of a lifetime and every moment exceeded the previous one.

Words will not do justice to this beauty hotel.

Everything was perfect!
The kindness of the staff! From reception, restaurant and bar, to the safari rangers, all work together in perfection like a well tuned orchestra to make you stay memorable.

Staying here is an all inclusive luxury experience. From gourmet meals, to sunset drinks with ocean views and safari drives with experienced rangers, all is taken care for. There are so many more details that this hotel will include in your stay, but I want make any more spoilers.

We had an ocean view cabin. These safari tent inspired rooms are luxurious. Beautifully simulating local huts but including all the amenities you could wish for in a five star hotel. The cabins are fully blended with nature and you might wake up to squirrels trying to invade or elephants strolling by. Make sure to follow staff recommendations keeping doors closed and not seeking direct contact with wild life.

Chena Huts has a lot of useful information on their website and we emailed them previously to our booking in order do make the most of our stay.

It was deservedly voted best small hotel in the world in 2023 and as far as I’m concerned it may well receive that honour again in 2024. The standard of everything is literally top notch. Most of all the whole team as individuals and collectively genuinely make you feel as though you and your friends and family are the most important people in the world. 

Let’s start with the welcome - outstanding. 

We went on two visits to the National Park and our Ranger was so knowledgable and enlightening we all feel we have learnt a huge amount and to some extent experienced it for ourselves. We witnessed nature in action, close up in the form of Crocodiles spotting and securing their supper of wild boar. Horrible but fascinating to watch but impossible not to as we saw it live so to speak. We saw so many elephants, leopards, water buffalo and other animals and birds and received a terrific explanation of how things are working g in the national park. 

Our bedroom was literally fabulous and I believe all are the same and of the same high standard with incredibly comfortable beds and each with a completely private plunge pool and terrace. I will share pics. 

Each evening we were hosted to sundowners on the beach with delicious nibbles made there and then. 

The restaurant and the service is outstanding with a good selection of western and Sri Lankan dishes.

He always ensured a safe and comfortable ride on the day trips which were organized by the hotel.  

The service at the restaurant and bar was also fantastic! Sajeevu, one of our waiters, was incredibly attentive, always greeting us with a smile and making sure we had everything we needed. His recommendations were excellent, and his friendly personality made dining even more enjoyable.  

Anura, one of the bartenders,  deserves praise as well. His company was always very pleasant and he took a great interest in the guests. He always proved to be a very good conversationalist.

Я мало где видела отзывы в период февраль-март, поэтому поделюсь своим мнением.

Погода. Прогноз погоды показывал грозы и дожди и запаслась настолками, чтобы не скучать в номере. Но оказалось все не так страшно. Дождь шел 15 минут 2 раза в день (честное слово) а дальше был рай, тепло (я ходила в шертах и футболке спокойно), влажно и пасмурно (если любите дикую жару и сонцепек вам может не понравится) Но я как уральский человек тяжело переношу сильную жару, поэтому была в диком восторге от погоды. В этот период мы гуляли по пляжу и окрестностям, наслаждались природой и отелем. Флаг был красный и мы купались в бассейне, хотя были и те кто купался в море. Но сгореть я умудрилась и через тучки 😁 на 4 день выглянуло солнце и начались дни купания на море, оно было теплое как парное молоко, вода голубенькая, песок белый. Пляж охраняемых и очень красивый. В общем, для себя отмечу это период сезоном для курорта Пасикуда острова Шри-Ланка 🫶

Про отель 🤔 Я выбирала между 3 отелями.
Первый был дороже, но у него были сложности с заходом в море. Сегодня прогулялись до него и правда, заход весь в обломках кораллов, хотя сам по себе отель красивый. 

Второй был дешевле и находится прямо рядом с нашим, но по отзывам там уставшие номера. Тоже сходила, посмотрела, визуально менее эффектный чем наш, но вполне уютный. 

А в этот отель я влюбилась с первых фото и окончательное решение мне помог принять высокий рейтинг отеля!! Я не ожидала, что такие рейтинги вообще бывают на более чем 2000 отзывов. 

Номера. Очень просторные и красивые. Уборка 2 раза в день 😱 без напоминаний, все было идеально чисто. У каждого дома стоит дерево Плюмерии, цветы, которого безумно вкусно пахнут. По утрам поют птицы.
Все номера стоят таким образом, что вы точно будете видеть кусочек море и много красивой зелени. 
 
Еда. Очень вкусная еда. Мы брали завтраки и ужины и для нас это было более чем достаточно. Я даже немного поправилась. 
Утром шведский стол (напитки входят в стоимость) Вечером у нас было по меню, но нереально вкусно и красиво. Бывали острые блюда, но вы можете перед заказом поговаривать, что не хотите острое и вам будут делать не острое 😁 все просто. Напитки оплачиваются отдельно (но это стандартно) вам приносят чеки, вы их подписываете и оплачиваете все при выезде.

Пляж. Не ну это просто рай!!! Прекрасный, широкий пляж. Который каждый день чистят. Белый песок, голубая водичка. Насколько я знаю белый песок не распространен на Шри-Ланке. А здесь именно он.

Территория.  Безумно зеленая, красивая. Бассейн, который визуально уходит в море. У лежаков бассейна вместо зонтиков изгородь из живых растений 💘 

Персонал. Я нигде не встречала настолько ответсвенных и доброжельных и отзывчивых людей. Ты прямо чувствуешь заботу и понимание со стороны КАЖДОГО сторудника. Все улыбаются, но не навязчивы. Я всегда выбираю отели 4-5* и очень критична к ним. Чаще отели мне не нравятся, чем наоборот, но тут даже я не нашла к чему придраться 🫶

Отель заботится о природе и не использует пластик. Все из бамбука, картона и бумаги, что тоже украшает имидж отеля.

Как оказалось отель Uga имеет целую сеть на Шри-Ланке. И я уже запланировала отдых в один из них.","Лучший отель. Очень рекомендую.","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r996951295-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The rooms are cleaned twice a day
The bed, linen and pillows are so nice and soft that even after you get sunburned it is very pleasant to sleep on them
Every morning, when I went to meet the sunrise, the gardeners, the guys who take care of the cleanliness of the territory and the beach from 5 am were already working like bees and at the same time the kitchen started working, which by 7 am prepared an excellent breakfast for us🙏By the way, when it comes to food, there is a huge selection of food, European cuisine and you can also try their local, which of course I spoiled myself with😊Everything is very fresh, waiters fly around you and constantly take care of you. By the way, even the chef sometimes approaches the guests and asks if everything is in order. The manager gathers the staff every evening before dinner and talks with them, apparently about the organization of everything, so everything works as it should watches. each of the service staff, from cleaners to managers, everyone greets you with a smile and asks how are you? what day have you had? they are interested in whether you are enjoying your vacation or everything is comfortable for you. I write a lot, because during my 10 days of vacation, I observed the details of the human attitude of the staff to the guests. they do not treat, because this is according to the rules, they have a soul and heart, they are really interested in you! They tell you and offer different opportunities, what you can see in their country or where it is better to go, what you need to pay attention to, and this is not for money, but just like that, without expecting anything in return! Everything is super in the hotel, I really liked it, I will be glad to return to them 🙏 the only thing you need to pay attention to if you choose this country is that you need to count on the fact that their alcohol is imported, that is why the price is high, plus they have a service percentage plus more something, so when you order something, it's better to clarify the final cost, so that you won't be surprised by the bills later😊But this didn't affect my wonderful vacation in this country in any way. Plus I got there on Valentine's Day, here of course the staff tried very hard to show the guests how they prepared for this day😊I'll definitely give photos and videos below.","I have extremely good impressions and I wrote everything else above in the reviews","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r994151126-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Unlike many hotels in that area it has a very wide beachfront area. It is set in a  well tended and manicured garden.
We had an ocean view room with a fabulous view across the beach and trees. The room was very spacious and comfortable and had everything you might need, including fridge ,safe, excellent A/C and a luxurious bathroom with plenty of hot water and a powerful shower.
The staff are very welcoming helpful and courteous.
The buffet breakfast was delicious and offered a whole range of Western and Sri Lankan dishes. 

If I were to offer any negative points it would be that the buffet dinner is quite expensive at 40$ per person. Also the beach bar plays music from 10.30am throughout the whole day. This can get pretty irritating when you're trying to relax and listen to the waves. Fortunately it is less intense if you go well off to one side of the beach. Maybe the hotel could offer quieter times on the beach?

All in all I do think this is a very good luxury stay and I would certainly return in the future.","The best hotel in Passikudah","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r994126655-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Hier ist der perfekte Ort um zu entspannen, den traumhaften Hotel-Strand zu genießen, eine Vielzahl an frischen Kokosnüssen zu vernichten (auch gern mit lokalem Rum drin) und die Seele baumeln zu lassen.

Unser Beachstudio hatte einen wunderschönen Ausblick, die Massagen im Spa waren wirklich toll (wenn auch verhältnismäßig teuer) und der Service ließ keine Wünsche offen. 
Minimalen Optimierungsbedarf an mancher Stelle gibt es ja immer, aber ein ganz besonderes Dankeschön möchten wir an Fazul ausrichten, der unseren Urlaub auf jeden Fall versüßt hat mit Freundlichkeit - ehrlichem Interesse - absoluter Service Orientierung :) vielen Dank für diese Bekanntschaft!

Das Team insgesamt war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich und das freundlichste / aufmerksamste Lächeln geht auf jeden Fall an „Musan“ im Restaurant (wir hoffen er hieß so) - wir hätten ihm am liebsten gleich abgeworben. 

Lieben Dank für die tollen Erinnerungen,

From the point we checked-in, the staff was so friendly and helpful and attentive to guest’s needs. We stayed for 3 nights at the suite and the suite was spacious and comfy. The resort has direct access to private beach and it was the starting of the Pasikuda season so there was no rain and the sea was so quite and calm. The blue sea and the brown beach were like a beautiful painting and the views all around are breathtaking. I suggest visiting during the season though it is bit expensive as then you can have a sunny weather and the best climate to explore the stunning beach and water sports.  
The property has some water sport activities and you can book them as you wish, we did snorkeling and it was amazing, we saw lots of fish and corals too. Talking about the property it claims the longest swimming pool in Pasikuda which is 108m and its beautiful. You can have a swim up and down the pool for a real workout or the gym too is great for that. They have indoor sports like table tennis, pool and board games like chess and carrom. 
I suggest going for the suite if you wish to have a relaxing stay as the suit is spacious with a separate living area, 2 TVs, a bathroom and another washroom, bathtub and a large balcony. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the minibar filled and it’s good if we had that too. 
The restaurant staff were so attentive to guest’s needs and I should specifically mention Kavindu, Amaya, Udara, Anjana, Mahinda (team lead), Imesh (restaurant captain) for their great service. Not forgetting others too. The platters were mouthwatering and the portions sizes are great. We were offered a new dessert the chef has prepared and that was tasty too. Thank you for the tasty platters, the chef and the team. The room service staff is also helpful and kudos to Mr. Ruwan (general manager) and the whole Sunrise Pasikuda team for your amazing hospitality. 
Wish to come again soon!","A nice relaxing stay in Pasikuda","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d28040522-r1000025061-Sunrise_Pasikuda-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

Nestled among the tea fields, it’s a beautiful and peaceful place to pause during a Sri Lanka journey — especially when the mists roll in over the hills.

The highlight of our stay was the way the hotel helped make our son’s birthday extra special. They surprised him with a birthday cake and a cheerful song, which was a really thoughtful and memorable gesture that he absolutely loved.

Our room was spacious, comfortable, and had lovely views — perfect for relaxing after days of travel. The boys enjoyed playing pool in the games area and exploring the hotel, and we appreciated the quiet, scenic atmosphere. It was also a good base for a brilliant day out whitewater rafting and canyoning in nearby Kitulgala.

While the hotel clearly puts effort into its guest experience, we did find the service a little over-attentive at times — well-meaning but not always relaxing. That said, the heart is in the right place, and the location and style make The Argyle a distinctive and memorable stop in the hill country.","Peaceful Highlands Retreat with a Thoughtful Birthday Surprise","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612383-d15666018-r1001906574-The_Argyle_Luxury_Boutique_Hotel-Hatton_Central_Province.html",

This was the fourth time my wife and I stayed at this hotel and each time, it simply gets better. Although we noted that the hotel was much busier compared to previous years, the service was faultless. The staff were exceptionally polite, friendly, helpful and always willing to go that extra mile to see to our needs. Rooms are spacious,  extremely comfy and well equipped. It is really living the life, sitting out on the balcony, sipping coffee and taking in the breathtaking views of the distant mountains, Tea plantations and Adams Peak, as dawn breaks. Breakfast and Dinners have always been sumptuous. The hotel also provides an excellent High Tea. The cleanliness of this hotel is second to none and whilst sitting out on the balcony we observed the gardener and other staff members busy at work.  The pool and the spar are additional facilities one can enjoy at this hotel. Whilst emphasising that the service provided to us by All staff members was exceptional, we would like to mention by name some of the staff who went over and above to respond to our requests. In the restaurant, Supervisor Udaya, Asst.manager Isuru, Manager Srikanth, Waiter Theagarajah,  Naomi and chef Tharaka Sanjeeva. Gardener Vijayakanth took pride in showing us his beautiful garden and naming all the plants. Others who we would like to mention are Baggage collector captain Sudarshan, Guest relations senior executive Subhorshini, Bell boy Gihan Siriwardena and of course the Ever amiable front office Manager Nadan who is always at hand to help you with the broadest of smiles - symbolising typical Sri Lankan hospitality.

The hotel staff was polite, attentive and friendly and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable from the receptionists, Yamal and Stacy to the restaurant team of Janith, Hansika and Binuri.

I would recommend the snorkelling - especially the 3 hour round trip to elephant rock. We also enjoyed the paddle boards and jet skis. The beach is safe, the sea is warm and the hotel is literally on the beach.

We found the staff helpful and generally attentive.

The reason I haven’t given Maalu Maalu five stars is because there were elements of the stay where it felt more of a resort than a five star experience - the buffet was similar every day, the service was sometimes slow and the rooms were lacking some of the individual touches. Additionally, our bathroom also backed onto a very noisy area where the staff seemed to convene all day and night.","A beach paradise","2025-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1016762964-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

So yummy. The infinity pool was just mesmerizing and they had unique chalets as well. The inside of the chalet had a large bathroom and the bedroom was not that much spacious but it was cozy and nice. I was so in love with the hotel but One thing I experienced was the bad smell that came out of the washroom as the room and the bathroom was kinda connected through a door. We informed the necessary parties about this and they came to fix the smell but the bad smell was still there. That was the only negative thing that I encountered. We went snorkeling in the morning and got to see the most insane beautiful unrealistic sunset that i have ever seen as the sky was blood red and orange. I wish I could capture that moment but couldn’t as my phone battery died.

Beach was very clean and they provided for everything. The gym is small but it has some free weights and even a bench. Regarding the food we only had breakfast booked and ate dinner in the a la carte restaurants. (2 of them there). They really did their best to accommodate for my gluten free diet ( Including a very good gluten free bread for breakfast) Also they really went out of their way to decorate our room for my birthday.
They also have a separate room for activities such as table tennis and pool. 
Only thing to improve on: whenever there was a larger group we had to wait for service for a long time. Waiters as well as house keeping. They needed to be reminded several times for us to get more water for our room for example. (So that in the end we went and got it ourselves) The available staff is extremely kind however there are just too few of them. Dinner took us at least 2.5 hours - and not because we are such slow eaters.

I am almost at a loss for words to explain just how incredible our stay was with Wild Coast Tented Lodge... We have never experienced the level of service we were so lucky to enjoy that at the Lodge. The staff was impeccable and so sincere. The kindness and thoughtfulness at every step was almost unbelievable. From Avinker our Ranger, to Dilshan who waiting on us for our dinners, to our personal concierge, Hasindu - the attention to our enjoyment was paramount. 
The rooms at the Lodge have to the best room we have ever stayed in. The design, the interiors, to the functionality, to the personal touches - it was perfection. A very special and romantic oasis to spend a lazy day or know that it was waiting for you when you returned from be away. I MISS that room!
I could go on and on... We were travelling for 6 wks - this was THE highlight of our travels.

Από τη στιγμή που φτάσαμε στο ξενοδοχείο, νιώσαμε τη ζεστή φιλοξενία του προσωπικού, που ήταν ευγενέστατο και πάντα πρόθυμο να μας εξυπηρετήσει. Ο butler μας ROHAN  ήταν πολύ εξυπηρετικός και πάντα στη διάθεση μας όταν τον χρειαζόμασταν!  Οι πολυτελείς σκηνές σχεδιασμένες για να ταιριάζουν με το φυσικό περιβάλλον, προσφέρουν άνεση, κομψότητα και μια αίσθηση περιπέτειας. Το εσωτερικό τους συνδυάζει ρουστίκ διακόσμηση με μοντέρνες ανέσεις ενώ το περιβάλλον γύρω με τα δέντρα και την πισίνα, προσφέρει μια αίσθηση χαλάρωσης και ελευθερίας! Το εστιατόριο του ξενοδοχείου ξεπέρασε κάθε προσδοκία. Οι γεύσεις ήταν απίστευτες, πρωινό, μεσημεριανό, high tea κ βραδινό με πιάτα που συνδυάζουν την παραδοσιακή κουζίνα της Σρι Λάνκα με σύγχρονες γαστρονομικές πινελιές! 
Ο Chef CHINTHAKA ήταν πολύ ευγενικός όπως άλλωστε και όλο το προσωπικό! Και πολύ καλός στην δουλειά του! Απίστευτος!!! 
Οι κοπέλες στο σπα ήταν επίσης πολύ ευγενικές και χαμογελαστές, καλά καταρτισμένες με την ειδικότητα τους! Έκανα δύο φορές με την ARI η οποία ήταν η καλύτερη και αν ξαναβρισκόμουν στο ξενοδοχείο εκείνη θα ζητούσα❤️ 
Το ξενοδοχείο βρίσκεται δίπλα στο Εθνικό Πάρκο Yala, κάτι που μας έδωσε τη δυνατότητα να απολαύσουμε αξέχαστα σαφάρι και να δούμε ελέφαντες, (λεοπάρδαλη για πρώτη φορά στη ζωή μου 🥹), διάφορα πανέμορφα πουλιά και πολλά ακόμα ζώα στο φυσικό τους περιβάλλον.
Στα σαφάρι γνωρίσαμε μοναδικούς ανθρώπους, τον BUDDHI ο οποίος ήταν πολύ καλά καταρτισμένος με την ειδικότητα του και με ενθουσιασμό για τη φύση και τα πλάσματα της που μας το πέρασε κ εμάς! Νιώσαμε πολύ ωραία μάλιστα πρώτη φορά έδωσα τόση προσοχή στα πουλιά τα οποία ήταν πολλά και πανέμορφα! Ο οδηγός μας στο safari (συγγνώμη που δεν θυμάμαι όνομα) νομίζω ότι ήταν ο καλύτερος κ ο πιο γρήγορος αφού προλαβαίναμε να δούμε καθαρά τα ζώα πριν απ ‘όλους!! Κάναμε τρεις μέρες σαφάρι και η καθεμία ήταν ξεχωριστή!! Εμπειρία ζωής και με τους κατάλληλους ανθρώπους μένει αξέχαστη! 
Από την πρώτη μέχρι την τελευταία στιγμή, κάθε λεπτομέρεια ήταν προσεγμένη, κάνοντας τη διαμονή μας πραγματικά αξέχαστη. Μια εμπειρία ζωής που σίγουρα θα θέλαμε να ξαναζήσουμε!

From the moment we stepped into our luxurious tent, we were completely captivated. The setting, the attention to detail, and the warm hospitality made us feel like royalty.

The entire team was exceptional—every single person was aligned in making our stay unforgettable. We joined two safari experiences, and on our very first outing, we were lucky enough to see elephants and even a leopard named James. It was simply magical.

Back at the lodge, we had some unexpected (and fun) visitors: monkeys lounging near our private pool. The connection to nature here is both real and enchanting.

And then… the food. Wow. Every single meal was exquisite, but the standout was a special Sri Lankan crab curry prepared for us by the chef on our final night—it was absolutely unforgettable.

We only stayed for three days, but they were deeply meaningful and will always hold a special place in our hearts. We can’t wait to return, explore more of Sri Lanka, and come back to this gem on the wild coast.","🌿 Wild Coast Tented Lodge – A Magical 25th Anniversary Getaway 🌿","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r1010266918-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

It is at the end of a highway and local road and then a track that our driver’s Prius negotiated at 10kph. 

Although you are outside the national park, no one has told the animals. And it gets elephants (actually dangerous if they are pissed off- our driver said his insurance specifically excluded elephant damage at Yala and that every year a few cars were damaged by angry young bull elephants). 

There are 110 variety of snakes in Sri Lanka - 30 are in the water and of the rest, about a third are poisonous. So you really, really don’t want to leave your doors or windows propped open. Monkeys cavort, beautiful spotted deer wander through and a monitor lizard the size of a small child may shortcut through the dining room. 

It’s very safe. At night there are always “rangers” to escort you to your tent/cabin. And they won’t let you leave the dining/pool area alone. 

The Wild Coast is vaguely adjacent a Hilton and two private hotels - Wild Cinnamon and and another place with huts. But you feel
Very isolated. It is on the Indian Ocean but the beach is gorgeous and eminently instagramable but not swimmable due to riptides and rocks and crashing surf. 

Really you are there for the safari drives into the park. I didn’t totally get that when I booked. We initially planned for three nights there but we did two  safaris on the first day (morning and afternoon) and they were so amazing - elephants with a baby, a leopard 2m away ambling by  the vehicle (after 40 min watching another one 90% hidden in a tree behind branches). Mongoose. Crocodiles. Spotted deer. Water buffaloes. Amazing birds like honey eaters and hornbills and water birds and adjuvant birds. 

The wild coast has - in my limited sense- access to some of the best drivers. And I was surprised that while the ranger guides were useful - they provided tons of interpretation and background and all had been working in the area for years- the drivers are equally, if not more so, critical to your experience. Our drivers - literally as well as metaphorically drove circles around other drivers in similar vehicles. 

The afternoon safari is time limited as the park closes at 6pm. While you don’t necessarily have to stay overnight if it closes, I had the sense that the drivers face big fines. Our driver took us from the leopard where it was 90% obscured and drove - harrowingly but not insanely - as he heard from another driver in his network about a good sighting. It was one of the highlights of our entire experience in Sri Lanka. It was glorious. Like being in the midst of a planet earth/David Attenborough video segment. 

There are a lot of safari trucks zooming around (fast and slow) Yala’s tracks. What I think you are getting is very experienced and capable drivers (we saw others broken down with smoking engines) and knowledgeable and patient guides who work with them. It’s expensive and not absolutely necessary if you are a surfer on a budget/ but it is worth it if you can swing it. 

The lodging itself is cute. They’ve created a physical plant of “tents” - a sort of British colonial tent camp with slightly streampunk tweaks. It works butter than I’m describing it and it is beautiful not cringe. A highlight for my partner were the copper fittings and a copper bath in the centre of the bathroom. 

The rooms and pools are lovely but smaller than the website photos which I can now see were taken with a wide angle lens. They are spacious in actuality but we had come from cape Weligama - a sister property we loved- and it was a visceral adjustment - even though cognitively we knew we were in the jungle adjacent to a national park. The power went off a few times overnight but went back on quickly. There is wifi and it is as good as anywhere in Sri Lanka and better than most other than electricity issues. 

You aren’t allowed food in your room (animals). And no room service (animals). There is an electric cooler and drinks - which are included. There isn’t a lot else to do. There is a spa. There is a large central domed restaurant with a quite large and lovely pool. And a beach area. A bar and a library dome with games. But that’s it. You are there to stay while waiting for safari drives. They do offer other trips to temples and a sanctuary for orphaned elephants. 

I had to inadvertently leave a day early for work on another part of the island. And they were incredibly kind to swap our last night as there was availability. But in the end I think two nights is probably perfect. Although we were lucky - the first morning drive was fun and Interesting but not as many big mammals. The second drive was spectacular - but it was really blind luck. It’s a huge park and just chance if you can see animals by the road in the area you happen to be in. Knowledgeable drivers/guides clearly increase your odds however. If you really wanted to increase your odds, maybe a third night or two nights and pay for an extra game drive - you get one included per a night. We found two on one day was eminently doable however 

Food was lovely in the restaurant. All food and some liquor is included. Our server - a you man named Milan was lovely and thoughtful. But everyone was actually quite nice and responsive. The high tea was okay. There is a sundowners happy hour kind of thing every night by the beach for sunset and it was lovely. 

We chose a tent with a pool. I think it is probably worth it. Sri Lanka is hot. Really hot. And muggy. You can’t swim in the room pool but it was lovely at night and in the morning and when we came back to the room.","A beautiful lodge next to an amazing national park","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r1004627305-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The location is breathtaking, the wildlife/landscapes stunning, the food is five stars, and the staff incredibly welcoming. Yes, it's expensive, but it is worth every single penny. By far one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in. Absolutely faultless. 
 
We stayed two nights and wish we could have stayed a week! The accommodation (tent) is beautiful. Luxury amenities and beautifully thought out. I highly recommend getting a tent with private pool (we were upgraded on arrival). That being said, the shared pool is stunning, not crowded, and close to the restaurant and bar with a fantastic view of the ocean. 

The food was exceptional, almost Michelin level in our opinion. You really can’t ask for much more. We just wish we were hungrier and could enjoy all the food on offer! You must try the Sri Lankan experience. 

Drinks were also fantastic, made even better by the exceptional service from Dulan in the bar. Sundowners were also fantastic. While you can’t swim in the sea, which is very rough, the view is simply outstanding.

You need to be escorted to your room each evening due to the wildlife. During our stay, a sloth bear and elephant were seen wondering through the grounds. On the way back to our room, there was a porcupine running around the edge of our pool.
 
The highlight was of course the Safari. Don't be put off by reviews that the park is over crowded and chaotic. Wild Coast Tented lodge thinks about every last detail, and we did not wait in long lines to get into the park, or to see the animals, unlike other tours operating in the area. Our guide, Buddhi and our driver Lucky made sure that we visited spots not frequented by other vehicles. Their expert knowledge of the animals meant that we still saw everything we wanted to see, but without any other vehicles, which was extra special. In some instances, we were some of the only vehicles to see Elephants, including several babies, and a leopard, which were proving extra elusive given rain the week before. We were able to track down leopards by their paw prints, and the sound of startled deer, which was an incredible experience. It is of course, still a game of luck, but we couldn’t be more thankful. The safari was completely tailored to what we were hoping to find and Lucky was far superior as a driver, allowing us to visit parts of the park that others couldn’t. He also had a fantastic eye for spotting animals. If I come back, I will be requesting the same duo for our safari! I should note, I believe that Wild Coast have trained people from the local fishing villages to drive the safari vehicles to up-skill and provide a better income. Overall, our safari team were exceptional, and we truly felt that we had the best of the best. They were so passionate about the land and animals. Buddhi should work for national geographic, he’s that good!
 
As mentioned, it is quite expensive. However, when you take into consideration the included safaris, quality and quantity of food, drinks, level of service, atmosphere, ambience and location, it completely worth it.

We also stayed at Cinnamon Wild next door, which was also great for the price and highly recommended, but if you can push the budget, this is non-negotiable and on another level! The hotel manager and staff at reception were also wonderful.
 
I simply cannot fault this place. It felt much more like an experience, where they have carefully thought about every detail. I almost never return to the same country, let alone the same hotel, but I will be making a trip back to Sri Lanka specifically to stay here again and experience Yala with their incredible team. I think it speaks volumes that every guest we spoke to felt exactly the same way. Next time, I will stay for much longer. I imagine the other properties Cape Weligama and Ceylon Tea Trails would also be amazing.

I would also note that if you enjoy safaris in Africa, or you're debating where to go, while this is a slightly different experience, the quality of safari/wildlife is just as good! The park is beautiful, and the tropical landscape offers something unique. Sri Lanka is a fantastic country, and there is so much more to experience if you're looking for an extended vacation. 
 
If you’re thinking of booking Wild Coast, just do it. It’s absolutely world-class.","Exceptional in every way! Flawless.","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r1002884784-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The staff will do everything to make you stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. On arrival your get a person appointed to assist you with everything you need. He will find you in the resort to check-in with you on occasion but you can also send him a message 24/7. We had Hasindu and he was the best. Nothing was ever too much and he was super-fast in his responses. 
We got a upgrade to a pool cocoon suite which was a lovely surprise. The suites are beautifully done and everything you need is there. You are in the middle of nature and its really private we did not hear or see any other guests when we were at our suite. You only hear and see nature. At night you fall a sleep with the sounds of a frogs and birds. 

The food is very versatile and there is plenty of choice. The quality is really high and we had some of the best curries here during our two week trip. We also loved all the different kind of non-alcoholic drinks that were available. 

For every night you get a safari to the Yala Park. We did one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Both were wonderful and included a driver and a ranger. The cars can take 5 people so it’s never a lot of people joining you. They get priority when entering the Park and this makes all the difference as it can get really busy in the mornings. They will bring snack and drinks in case you need it as well. 

The pool and beach are amazing to chill for days or just a couple of hours. We spend a day at the beach and although the hotel was fully booked it felt really sirene. 
Communication prior to our stay was excellent and they really take all your preferences seriously. After our visit we completed their internal review form but never gotten any feedback or acknowledgement on this unfortunately. 

To consider:
The Spa was not what we expect from this level of resort. But if you want to have a quick massage then it’s fine but if you are looking for a high level spa experience it’s not the place. 

The service was excellent and we would gladly stay here again and definitely look into their other hotels when going back to Sri Lanka.","Amazing Stay","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r1002182760-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

We also have to give a huge shoutout to our driver, who was an absolute legend. He somehow always got us into the best positions for leopard sightings, even with the crowds around. We felt like we were in the best possible hands.

The staff at the lodge were warm, welcoming, and always going above and beyond to make us feel at home.

We stayed in the Queen’s Suite, and from the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The name of the hotel truly speaks for itself—they make you feel like a royalty in every possible way.

I’ve stayed in many hotels around the world, but the service here is the best I’ve ever experienced. Every single staff member was warm, attentive, and genuinely dedicated to making our stay unforgettable. Their hospitality and attention to detail were simply extraordinary.

The property is stunning—a beautifully secluded, peaceful retreat surrounded by nature. It’s charming, quiet, and impeccably maintained. Perfect for anyone looking to relax, recharge, and escape the noise of everyday life.

The food was phenomenal—full of rich flavors and beautifully presented. Dining here was a highlight of the entire trip.

We also had the convenience of a personal driver throughout our stay, which made exploring Sri Lanka completely stress-free. The transportation was punctual, professional, and made the journey seamless.

A special thank you to the housekeeping team, who went above and beyond. The room was always spotless, and the creative towel animals left each day added such a thoughtful and fun touch—it truly brought a smile to our faces daily.

Kings Pavilion is more than a hotel—it’s a full experience. We left feeling refreshed, deeply cared for, and already dreaming of our return.

Thank you - for keeping your promise, making me smile this morning, and for outdoing all others with praise for me personally! I can’t recall anyone being quiet so kind but alas, I must graciously share the limelight with 52 dedicated souls who made your week a happy one, and whose attention to detail invariably surpasses my own. It was a pleasure to be your host however and spend time in your company. Thank you for taking an interest in how I came to be here and the story behind the hotel. 

I’m delighted our modest effort met the moment of your wife's significant celebration (TA forbids use of names in replies). Guest celebrations add smiles to our days too, but whether the same would be said, by your early morning coffee steward is anyone's guess!

Given that so many remarkable things have been written already, I cannot imagine the task of reviewing Buckingham Place – in our 15th year I still pinch myself with every great review. As for less than ecstatic ones? Some remind me that we are only human, while most remind me that others are! 

I hope we have the privilege of welcoming you back to the hotel soon. In the meantime, thank you for your valuable good custom, excellent company and a review that humbles us all. I wish you safe, peaceful and happy travels and a blissfully happy life.

Thank you.

Bizarrely, I did find a couple of reviews which weren't ecstatic and all I can say is, they must have been staying at a different hotel.
Mr Nick, your attention to detail is magnificent, from the ""Happy Birthday"" message written with flower petals in our room, the Birthday Cake and Happy Birthday banner on our last night, or the fresh coffee delivered to our verandah every morning as we watched the sun come up - awesome, all of it.

Many thanks for reposting this fabulous thumbs up on Trip Advisor, and for posting it in the first instance as a Google review. Support on either is appreciated, appearing on both could not be more helpful for us.

All the same, I’m equally grateful for everything you write in between – for the avoidance of doubt! On behalf of everyone here, thank you very much for coming back – again. Thanks for your continued loyalty and kind words, and for being such good sports. We enjoyed seeing you again, as much as we did spending time in your company.

Your surprise stay was an unexpected delight for us too, and also, from the moment you arrived until you left. Without wishing to seem gleeful, your booking mishap was great news for us. Not only for your valuable, unexpected custom, but finding ourselves with four cheerful souls - a magical family to host, just as the hotel was emptying as is traditional for early May. Your stay could not have been more welcome, pleasant or better timed.

Despite my age, my memory for past guests is pretty good. No recall of names naturally, but so far faces, especially those of standout folk. I shall remember you all, for the sunshine you brought us and, your remarkable patience and positivity. I would surely have ranted and been a crushing bore had my own holiday gone so awry! 

I am delighted we were here for you and on point, and, that you have written so eloquently recounting, an experience over a hotel stay. Your support through your good custom and top-notch review is highly prized and second to none. Thank you, thanks to all of you and your travel agents! It was a pleasure, a privilege and another fond memory for us all, plus, more happy travelers we can look forward to welcoming back someday soon, I hope.

From the moment we arrived until the second we left, everything was just right. And if something wasn’t, the team made it right immediately. The attention to detail here is outstanding — we won’t spoil the surprises, but trust us, they’ve thought of everything.

It’s hard to explain exactly what makes this place so special. It’s not just the comfort, design, or food — though all are excellent. It’s the atmosphere, the calm, the care. You’ll see it echoed in every other review.

Above all, it’s the people who make Buckingham Place truly exceptional. The staff are warm, thoughtful, and genuinely committed to making your stay perfect. And Nick, the owner, leads by example — always present, always welcoming.

It doesn't miss a beat or leave doubt, those who read it will simply come too; because, if it inspired me to look back at reviews for the season it will inspire them to. You amplify a thousand times, how wonderful our guest lists are and the affection, passion and respect many shares for this place, moreover, the team behind it doing all the hard work. I cannot thank you enough for your many accolades, I can barely count them. And, although humbled, we will bask in your praise at our end of season party when I recite your 'mother of reviews' for the team - before the arrack starts flowing that is!

That you thought to keep Buckingham Place a secret in case everybody comes? All I can say is, without perfect reviews like yours, this being a small, remote access hotel it would be done for in no time and thus, not here to welcome you back - I hear you are already checking dates?! 

Thank you again for coming, and for your good custom, eloquence and for being awesome guests. I'm thrilled you had a magical and memorable stay; it was a pleasure and a privilege to serve you, and I'm still overwhelmed by your kind words!

From the moment we drove into the hotel complex to the moment we were waved off by the team saying goodbye, everything was simply perfect….every member of the team was congenial and ‘on it’ …nothing was too much trouble and needs we didn’t know we had were met and exceeded. They have all been trained by Nick Buckingham, the owner and very amenable host, whose pride in what he has built is understandable and just shines through.
The food is excellent…it didn’t occur to us to explore eating anywhere else, the pool area and gardens are Conde Nast cover shoot worthy and we enjoyed a skilful massage at the spa.
We had a secluded superior room and it was huge…a separate dressing area and a bathroom to die for…open air shower anyone?
The attention to detail was inherent throughout, from the flowers that adorned our room to the candle and matches next to the sunken bath tub, to the refillable water bottles that meant we didn’t see a plastic bottle for the entirety of our stay….and the coffee brought to our room every morning to drink on the veranda was especially welcome.
The beach is deserted, which we loved, with miles of clean beautiful sand accompanied by roaring waves, nature at its finest. The only time we ventured out was for a couple of hours one evening…it was a wrench…but we were rewarded by the sight of a turtle laying eggs and baby turtles scrabbling to the sea for the first time…just magical.
I almost didn’t write this review as I’d love to keep Buckingham Place a secret, but as it was recommended to me, I’m doing the right thing and recommending it also. I was unusually emotional when it came to leave and we’re already talking about when we can return.

Before we arrived I'd read the reviews and questioned whether the hotel could live up to all the accolades. But be assured it does - the food is absolutely incredible. The service is literally the best I've seen in any hotel, anywhere. Warm, helpful, without being too intense. When my son was ill they made him food he was happy to eat, and took away any stress from the situation. The pool area is a wow. The beach is beautiful -  as everyone says, you cannot swim in the sea by the hotel, but a walk along to the rock pool for a dip first thing is a memorable activity. This was a perfect ending to a wonderful Sri Lankan stay. Couldn't recommend more!

As I share recent rave reviews with the team, as I reply to exceptionally kind folk who wrote them – now you, I feel immensely proud and lucky. Proud to have (accidently) created a place that captures the hearts and imaginations of its patrons, and lucky - that I still enjoy my life as a hotelier, 15 years on from reinventing myself as one. Thank you, but the picture you paint of a happy, wonderful hotel, simply reflects how I feel and is the root cause of it, if that makes any sense?

Obviously, your praise humbles me to the point of blushing but, it makes me smile a lot too, thank you. That said, I won’t take all the credit for your memorable stay or the reason you require another. Propping me up is a band of happy, diligent, hardworking men and women, all of whom going to the end of the earth every day for their guests and me. I haven’t a clue why they’d hide the swim up bar from you though, at least you have another reason to come back?!

I’m delighted you enjoyed yourselves, approve the colour scheme and, have written so eloquently in favour of what this place is all about. You were excellent, very welcome company, so thank you again. 

Until we meet again, happy greetings from Rekawa, where the sky is as blue and sunny as it gets, and the music, is barely audible over the sweet sound of the sea…     

Thank you,

To return anywhere after 10 years takes a huge leap of faith – thank you for yours. If it hasn’t closed down, been paved over or ‘modernized’ to suit a younger demographic, it is very rare to find anywhere as good as or better than it was back then. Your stand out review therefore, is incredibley helpful. It reasures all former guests, all first time to Sri Lanka travelers and us too, that we are still on the right track after all these years, and previous reviews remain relevant. Thank you very much for a truly heartwarming confidence boost!

Your valued custom, top recommendation and moreover, your excellent company, are all second to none. And, whilst I might complain your return with grown up kids aged me a tad, I shall do my best to be here when they bring theirs!!

Thank you for coming back - that you did was a highlight of the season for us all.

Sometimes, a review says as much or more about its originator, than the hotel itself. Yours is a perfect example - thank you. 

I am touched by the fact that in spite of your brief stay, you have taken time and made the effort to write a stand-out review - for the sake of those in your footsteps and in support of us. I’m delighted we could add to the overall enjoyment of your time in Sri Lanka, and sent you home nurturing an idea perhaps, to return one day? If only we’d had longer to convince you or you had met some of our regular guests who would leave you in no doubt, that Sri Lanka is definitely not a once only destination.  

However briefly guests visit they are no less appreciated for choosing the hotel, or for their valuable custom and good company. Thank you for yours and this over and above review. Simply, you are 'top' guests, and we would be privileged to serve you again. In the meantime, and always, I wish you happy travels and blissfully happy lives.

Lots of wildlife to watch  outside the rooms with a nice secluded veranda in the lovely gardens.

You generously compliment all aspects of the hotel so I have circulated a translated copy of your review amongst the team this morning, who will be as proud as I am to read your kind praise. I am only sorry that I wasn't aware of your initial disappointment over being unable to swim in the sea. I can only say how relieved I am that our team, cuisine, cocktails and the beach itself, nonetheless measured up to mitigate this, and that it didn’t detract unduly from your stay overall.
 
Thank you for bringing your valuable good custom and fine company to Buckingham Place, and for supporting us all so magnificently on this forum. If you ever return to Sri Lanka, like so many do please be sure to stay with us again - it would be a pleasure and privilege to welcome you both back.

Yes, your first sentence should be enough for any traveler but if not, everything that follows it will melt the most diehard skeptic and have them beat a path to our gates immediately.

Your glorious review brought a big grin to my face and, a lump to my throat this morning – thank you, I will of course share it with the Team. You say you struggled to better your previous words? You only prove what a spectacular wordsmith you are with both reviews – they are as good as they get quite frankly, thank you for taking the time to support is so magnificently. Your praise for everyone overwhelms and humbles us all.
 
That you feel a sense of belonging at Buckingham Place is because you do, you belong here by becoming a part it. You’re in its DNA, whether by socialising with other guests or me, embarking on a project with the Team or springing to my mind when I boast how good our guest lists are. You may not realise or believe this, we look forward to your holiday, enjoy it too, and are sad to wave goodbye as you leave. This time you were a big part of two especially joyous weeks, with nearly half the house occupied with lovely folk we’ve seen before.

I feel confident to send this from the bottom of every heart here. You two are up there with the best. I cannot think of another couple I would rather share this oasis of timeless tranquility with, or two more engaging, interesting, elegant old-school travelers who come to stay.

Thank you for bringing your valuable good custom to us again and for your empathy towards us all. Thank you for writing so eloquently about your stay once again but above all - thank you for being such great company. I shall look forward to welcoming you back for stay No4. In the meantime, and always, please take care of yourselves and each other, and have a blissfully happy and healthy life.

Warmest regards and respect - and the biggest of hugs!

Nick, Kalpa and the Team.

I don’t know how many hotels you visited but that ours was your favourite is a wonderful complement - thank you, I’m thrilled that it was. 

I’m delighted the hotel stood out for all the right reasons, and grateful for the timely swimming reminder – it can never be said too many times! For others reading my reply, the nearby rock pool is great for splashing around in, swimmable beaches are within easy reach - we recommend according to time of year. Rekewa’s Beach is also clean, unspoiled and thus a prime nesting ground at night for Sea Turtles.

Thank you for staying with us - do please come back; and join the many lovely folk for whom Buckingham Place has become a favourite old club! Thanks again for your valuable custom and this fabulous review, but moreover, thank you for your excellent company,

It is surrounded by a lush garden, and beyond this coconut palms stretch as far as the eye can see. A myriad of exotic, brightly coloured birds and butterflies have made the estate their home.
Our room was located on the ground floor, beautifully furnished and with a lovely spacious veranda to relax on and enjoy our surroundings. Each night we ate on our veranda sumptious Sri Lankan dishes freshly prepared to our tastes and using ingredients grown on the estate. One evening we joined the chef to watch him prepare our meal.
There was a lovely pool in the garden to swim in. In the morning we were taken on a walk around the estate's gardens and into the local village. We visited the coconut processing plant which was very interesting. Our guide showed us the different fruits, vegetables and flowers that are grown locally. It was the first time that I had seen coffee grown! We also went on a bullock ride around the estate where we were able to sample a wide range of tropical fruits that were growing.

The rooms are clean, luxurious, and very quiet, making you feel great.
- The location of the hotel is ideal. Almost all attractions of the city are within walking distance, or 5-10 min. by taxi/tuk tuk.  The Seaside, Buddhist & Hindu temples, the Pettah market, the national museum, the Gale Face shopping mall.
- We had full-board. The variety of food was plentiful and very tasty. We had the chance to taste local dishes, which we cannot find in Europe.  
- The common areas of the hotel are very beautifully decorated, making you feel you are in a museum. 
- The staff is plentiful and very friendly, offering assistance whenever needed. 
- Special thanks to Rabina and Prabudhya. They were very friendly and welcoming, helping us with some small issues.

Thank you for the great hospitality. We wish to come back soon :D","Outstanding hotel and hospitality","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d29019029-r1016790421-Cinnamon_Life_City_of_Dreams-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The swimming pool lifeguards were also fantastic – attentive, professional, and made us feel at ease while the kids had fun.

The breakfast buffet and lunch were excellent, offering a wide and delicious variety that made each meal a highlight of our day.

Got welcomed with small ceremony and cold towels, very refreshing after long flight. Rooms are spacious and the balcony had an amazing view of ocean. The breakfast was exquisite, including fruits, bread basket with butter and fresh muffins among the breakfast you oder fresh juice. Hotel also has 2 infinite pools with ocean view. We had few encounters with local animals, including chipmunks, lizards, frogs, monkeys and peacocks. However the location is not suitable for elderly or maybe with small children, because rooms are located on different levels with no elevators; also both beaches require walking up and down the hills and/or stairs. Hotel provides free tuk-tuk rides to both of them. Recommend getting local sim card to call for tuk-tuk back to hotel. Owner also was there almost all the time and if you have any requests you can ask him as well, he’s very friendly and greeted every guest every dinner.

Отличный отель с панорамными бассейнами, шикарные номера с видом на океан, большие балконы, много зелени и добрых, почти ручных животных: бурундуки, павлины, обезьянки. Вкусная кухня с обилием морепродуктов, живая музыка на ужине. Внимательный и вежливый персонал, ну и главное управляющий Asanka! Это просто супер, решает все проблемы, умный, интеллигентный, очень чуткий и внимательный. PS На отдыхе повстречались с собственником отеля, очень милый и добрый человек, любит музыку, сам поет песни, дарит подарки и угощает шампанским и прочими вкусностями.","Езжайте и не думайте, это лучший отель в Тангалле!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r1006188352-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Хотя стараемся не повторяться и брать что то новенькое. Номера великолепны, но это не про стандартные (тут все простенько и без видов). Виды с балкона не описать словами на сколько завораживают. Питание отличное, морепродуктов долго потом не захочется. При чем когда питались обедами вне отеля и на экскурсиях - еда не понравилась совсем. Алкогольные напитки ТОЛЬКО качественные и ими щедро угощают! Обязательно презентуют прощальный обед и 2 пачки чая с сувенирами. Дочке хозяин отеля подарил сережки из сувенирной лавки на отъезд! 
Замечательные панорамные бассейны на територии, вечерами зажигают фонари и становится очень романтично. 
Мало номеров - соответственно и народу не много, нет давки, толпы,  каждый сам по себе. Идет ст��ойка новых корпусов, но мы ее не слышали (хотя читали в отзывах, что шумно, нет, нет шума). 
Сервису отеля хочется выразить ОСОБУЮ благодарность - Асанка следит за всем - и на ресепции все косяки исправит и в ресторане при нем все сразу суетятся, стараются. Очень умный, внимательный метродотель - лучше мы еще не встречали НИГДЕ. Всегда выслушает твою проблему или пожелание и тут же будет направлять людей ее исправлять.
Очень надеемся вернуться в отель снова! Здесь нам всегда рады, а это очень подкупает:)","Рай","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r1003931938-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Далее, сильная сторона это шикарный вид и много живности вокруг: бурундучков (на самом деле, это пальмовые белки) кормили с рук, павлины летают, обезьяны лазают по деревьям. Еда вкусная, но не очень разнообразная, зато наелись морепродуктов фруктов! В номере чисто, полотенца меняют ежедневно, постельное белье не меняли, крема для тела нет, кровать удобная, сплит шумит и дует на кровать, Рядом  2 пляжа в пешей доступности: Унакурува (не очень понравился, грязно и место занято лодками, купаться можно) и Сайлент (красивый с волнами, прыгали по волнам). Ездили на индивидуальные экскурсии (сафари и двухдневную Элла+Сигирия) с гидом +94784700761, связь в телеге, зовут Прасад, хорошо говорит по-русски. Остались довольны: цена немного дешевле, чем у других, информацией не перегружал, комфортный автомобиль, водитель супер, на каждой достопримечательности оказывались  до большого потока туристов, что давало возможность спокойно сделать прекрасные фото и видео, именно такой продуманный индивидуальный тур мы и искали.

Про отель сказано много, но я действительно в него влюбилась. Очень душевное место. Бесконечно много птиц, особенно в душу запали попугаи и мяуканье павлинов. Много разных животных, как дневных, так и ночных. Вид из номера великолепный. Днем в жаркое время лежишь в номере и любуешься океаном, а ночью (если не закрывать шторы) любуешься звездами и светлячками. 
Постельное белье хорошее с приятным ароматом, в номере действительно хочется находиться, а не просто приходить переночевать. Уборка и смена полотенец каждый день.
Но главная жемчужина отеля – это его персонал и, конечно же, Асанка. Безумно приятный коллектив, который старается сделать твой отдых лучшим. Официанты так вообще такие милахи. Угостили вкусным манго, всегда проявляли заботу, были максимально внимательными.
Асанке же отдельная благодарность за внимание и заботу! Человек действительно отдается на все 100 %. Без него отель был бы не тот. 
Сходили на спа. Всем рекомендую надевать худшие вещи. Но, если быть честными, спа не совсем оправдал ожидания. Хотелось приятного и ароматного масла, релаксирующую музыку (никаких мелодий не было, доносился детский визг из бассейна), чтобы полностью расслабиться. Мне массаж делала девушка, моему мужу – мужчина. И мне, и мужу было некомфортно. Мне – из-за того, что тот мужчина-массажист прекрасно видел меня, для кого-то это ничего страшного, я же предпочитаю более уединенную обстановку. Также хотелось бы, чтобы были зажжены благовония. Но увы. Массаж того не стоит. Но на вкус и цвет, как говорится.
Завтраки и ужины в отеле. Мне очень нравились салаты. Столы от еды не ломятся, но ��ожно найти что-то по душе. Если вы сладкоежки, как и я, и любите вкусненькое, то с десертами будет сложновато.
В данном отеле благодаря всей команде чувствуешь себя желанным и дорогим гостем. Сделали небольшой подарок – две коробки чая. Также в прощальный вечер угостили вином.
Через Асанку отправились на экскурсию в Эллу. Водитель очень понравился. Учел все наши пожелания, не торопил. Сама экскурсия тоже очень понравилась. Посетили чайные плантации. Прокатились на поезде. Посмотрели и прогулялись по девятиарочному мосту. Поднялись на Малый пик Адама, виды открылись потрясающие (обязательно поднимайтесь). Покормили обезьянок, которые чуть не забрали мою сумку. Эти бандиты, как только увидели фрукты в моих руках, сбежались все на меня и просто выхватывали из рук и сумки, но это было очень весело и забавно. Также на обед заехали в классный ресторан, название не знаю, завез нас водитель, было безумно вкусно, и готовили очень быстро, безумно приветливый там персонал. В сравнении с местными кафе в окрестностях отеля уровень сервиса и приготовления заслуживает особой похвалы. В дороге в сторону Эллы находились около 2х часов, назад соответственно тоже. Выехали в 6 утра, вернулись в 4 часа дня. Всем рекомендую именно индивидуальные экскурсии. По цене вышло очень даже вкусно.
Также от отеля организовали индивидуальный трансфер до аэропорта, так как намучались с групповым, когда добирались до отеля. Также хотела бы порекомендовать данную услугу. К слову, водитель у нас был тот же, с которым мы отправлялись на экскурсию.

Помню, кто-то интересовался кофе в отеле. Латте неплох.

Если поедите в диквеллу к черепахам, там есть очень вкусное кафе - пицца 🔥 из печи, мы такую очень любим.

Экскурсионную программу - Элла - прям очень рекомендую. 

Резюмирую по отелю: отель прекрасный, коллектив душевный, животный мир удивляет, мощь океана завораживает","Прекрасный отпуск в прекрасном отеле","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r1000788836-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Приземлились в аэропорту Матала, до отеля ехать около часа (но мы завозили туристов в другие отели, поэтому, вышло 2ч). Если заказать такси, получится намного быстрее.
В аэропорту можно поменять доллары на рупии (курс такой же, как и в городе), купить сим-карту оператора Диалог. Тариф там только один, 30 гбайт, около 1500-2000 рупий (чтобы перевести в рубли, делим на 3). Очередь на обмен и покупку сим-карты большая, если вам не нужно срочно что-то оплачивать в местной валюте (такси, воду, еду в кафе) - можно сделать всё тоже самое в городе, заказать тук-тук от отеля до города Тангалле, ехать минут 5-7. Водители привозят сразу в те места, куда вы попросите, не придется искать обменник или офис с сим-картами самостоятельно, еще и подождут вас, и отвезут обратно. Хорошо понимают по английски, или можно использовать переводчик на местный, сингальский язык

Тук-туки заказывали только через отель, всегда приезжали очень хорошие водители. Искать тук-тук в городе самостоятельно не рекомендую.

Автобус от аэропорта остановился на дороге, до отеля еще 3 минуты на машине (ехать в горку и дорога очень узкая, автобус не может проехать). Добрались вечером, нас угостили кокосами, подарили лотос, дали свежие влажные махровые полотенца для лица. Провели ритуал с зажжением свечей и пригласили в номер. Сотрудники при вашем виде встают по стойке смирно, улыбаются, здороваются, это очень приятно! Забрали все вещи, буквально ""сняли"" с нас куртки и рюкзаки, быстренько отнесли всё в номер.

Разместились в номере с видом на океан на верхнем этаже, красота невероятная! На крышах гуляют павлины, на балконах бегают бурундуки, природа вокруг вас) Есть много открытых террас, два бассейна с видом на океан, сами ""коридоры"" отеля проходят сквозь деревья. Можно посидеть на диванчике с видом на океан, много разных ""закоулков"". Есть магазин чая и драгоценностей, прямо в отеле.

Номера чистые, уборка каждый день, ставят свежие цветы в вазу, есть шампунь, гель для душа, бальзам, гигиенические наборы, фен, сейф, тапочки.
Можно попросить халаты. Средство от комаров брали с собой, но не пользовались ни разу. Складывали деньги и документы в сейф, но есть ощущение что можно было бы и не убирать.

Розетки европейские, нужно попросить переходник на ресепшен (вы будете с ними на связи в вотсапе, отвечают очень быстро, выполняют практически любую просьбу). Стирка стоит 3 доллара за килограмм, стирали вещи дважды, нам даже погладили носочки!

В номере могут быть гекконы (ящерицы), муравьи, обязательно закрывайте двери балкона, и чтобы не было щелок снизу. Ночью на балкон приходят мангусты, утром - павлины, обезьяны, бурундуки. На деревьях около ресторана и у бассейна летают лет��чие мышки и лисицы, но бояться не стоит) они просто летают мимо.
Если пойдете куда-то за пределы отеля вечером, в темноте (солнце садится около 6 вечера), обязательно светите фонариками под ноги, на тропинках ползают скорпионы, и наступить на них опасно. 

Вай фай не супер сильный, иногда прерывался, пользовались сотовой связью т.к. купили сим-карты. Есим тоже можно купить, через туроператора лучше не брать, дороже в несколько раз.

Мы брали только завтраки, и пожалели - нужно было завтрак+ужин. На ужине живая музыка, часто можно встретить владельца отеля, он тоже поет. Подходит к гостям, знакомится, спрашивает как проходит отдых, очень приятный человек!
Еда не супер разнообразная, но очень вкусно, сытно, много фруктов и выпечки. Можно попросить приготовить омлет, скрембл, яичницу, или панкейки. Свежевыжатые соки, айс-кофе, мороженое, ананасы, бананы, яблоки, мандарины, арбузы, маракуйя, папайя. Манго не было, покупали на рынке в Тангалле, 1100-1400 рупий за килограмм (туда тоже можно заказать тук-тук от отеля, стоил 1500 рупий туда-обратно, или 800 в одну сторону). Кофе, чай, можно заказать бесплатно.

Ужины мы покупали за 20 долларов с человека, свежая рыба, креветки, кальмары - можно попросить приготовить всё, что понравится. Салаты, паста, рис, всего в достатке. Сотрудники бегают вокруг вас, подвигают стулья, приносят напитки, салфетки, убирают посуду каждые 2 минуты, просто браво! Когда муж брал напиток, а я нет - специально подходили и спрашивали, что мне принести? Это уже не просто хороший сервис, а настоящая забота о своих гостях. Однажды мы сели за стол, который чуть-чуть шатался, сотрудник заметил, что я обратила на это внимание, и уже через минуту подбежал и положил картонку вниз, чтобы стол выровнялся. 

Арендовали минивэн тоже с помощью отеля, съездили в город Галле, очень красивый форт. Водитель всё время ждал нас, отвез в магазин чая с невысокими ценами, показал, где купить сувениры, был очень вежлив! Цена получилась ниже, чем при заказе через тур агентов. 

В отеле около 20 номеров, никакой анимации, тишина и спокойствие. Если уезжаете куда-то утром, с собой дадут ланч-бокс (сэндвич, фрукт, маффин, сок манго).

Ближайший пляж Унакурува в 200 метрах, мы ходили пешком, но можно бесплатно заказать тук-тук (обратно нужно подниматься в горку). Пляж маленький, деревянные лежаки бесплатные, можно взять полотенца, которые лежат у бассейна, полосатые. Белые из номера - нельзя. Пляж маленький, находится в бухте, волны небольшие. Можно арендовать серф за 1000 рупий/час, или сап - 3000 рупий/час. Мы брали серф просто полежать на нем в океане)
На пляже и по пути к нему бегают собачки, можно встретить ящериц, бурундуков, варанов. Вараны не очень приятные, лучше обходить стороной.
Второй пляж Сайлент бич чуть дальше, но очень красивый! Тоже можно добраться на тук-туке бесплатно от отеля, людей мало, невероятный закат, но волны большие, заходите аккуратно. Были дни, когда мы не смогли там поплавать, ""прибивает"" волной очень сильно. Как спускаетесь на пляж и налево - кафешка с местной едой, кушали там несколько раз, всё вкусно. Даже можно взять с собой, заворачивают в фольгу. Кокос - 400 рупий, рис с курицей - 1600, пожарить свежую рыбу - 4000 рупий, хватит на двоих, вместе с ней рис и овощи (отличный ужин). 
Если местные будут предлагать экскурсии на пляже, отказывайтесь, у вас просто так заберут деньги. 

Обязательно съездите на пляж Батигама, там сможете поплавать с большими черепахами! О нем мы тоже узнали благодаря сотрудникам отеля. Уехали туда на тук-туке, минут 15-20, 5000 рупий туда-обратно. Если есть маски, берите с собой, или можно арендовать на пляже, как и попросить еду для черепах. Обязательно плавайте в тапочках, большой риск наступить на ежа!

Спф 50+ обязательно! Забыла намазать ступни один раз, и они сгорели за 10 минут так, что пришлось ехать в аптеку, заматываться бинтами. У мужа сгорели уши, до волдырей. Солнце очень коварное, даже на закате (в 16-17 часов) нужно мазаться кремом, обновлять раз в 2-3 часа.

Ездили на двухдневную экскурсию через Маду тур @srilankamadu_tours
Цены ниже, чем через турагенство, автобус с кондиционером, водитель отличный (особенно на сумашедших дорогах). Гид Ишар говорит по-русски, сам жил в Беларуси, невероятно добрый человек, очень понравился. Рассказал много интересных фактов, историю, отвечал на все вопросы, даже писал наши имена на местном языке. Но мы пожалели, что взяли второй день, достаточно было одного (девятиарочный мост, малый пик Адама, поезд, водопад, чайная плантация). Отель, в который привозят для ночевки в двухдневной экскурсии, мягко говоря, неприятный, даже просто поспать одну ночь там не хочется. Персонал безразличный, везде плесень, судя по отзывам на гугл мапс - там еще и клопы. Слава богу, нас не покусали. Но зато был супер красивый вид на водопад. Ужин и завтрак скудные.
На второй день посетили башню, два храма, в которые нас не пустили (был праздник и ремонт), кормили слона и в конце подъем на гору Сигирия или Пидурангула. Лучше выбрать первую, хоть она и выше (около 1200 ступенек). На Пидурангулу придется карабкаться по камням, не каждый это выдержит (сначала около 400-500 ступенек, потом камни). Ничего кроме красивого вида для себя там не нашли, поэтому, о втором дне пожалели) обратно до отеля ехали на автобусе около 7 часов. 
Лучше съездить на экскурсию Элла+Сафари за 1 день, но тут уже вам решать.

Невероятный отдых получился только благодаря отелю, желаю им только процветания и благодарю за каждый день в таком чудесном месте! Так заботиться о гостях нужно поучиться.","Идеальный отель","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r997405079-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Пожалуй, это было лучшее путешествие в отель Mayavee… 
Если говорить о своих ощущениях, то , казалось, что нашу семью пригласил дальний друг в гости, и мы приехали.Столько внимания к нам, к деталям, всем нашим пожеланиям- еще нигде мы не ощущали. Очень уютный, утопающий в зелени отель, с прекрасной кухней, обслуживающим персоналом, и , самое главное, с главным менеджером отеля - Asanka. Готова благодарить его постоянно, ведь это сервис уровня Top! Настолько чуткий, внимательный, заботливый, он действительно профессионал своего дела!
Мистер Нуван, владелец отеля, делает все возможное для того, чтобы гости чувствовали себя самыми желанными в отеле! Его щедрость не знает границ! Спасибо!
Очень удачное расположение- рядом 2 пляжа,в пешей доступности, и много других ,если воспользоваться тук- туками. На любой вкус!
А виды!!! Это нечто. Даже наш экскурсовод сказал, что нам нет смысла ехать на ‘ кокосовый остров’, тк мы живем на таком-же в отеле и нас ничего не удивит, так и есть.
Отель расширяется, мистер Нуван развернулся не на шутку! Будут отдельные виллы, спорт зал, детская комната и большая территория для прогулок!
Но, даже без всего этого, я ощущала себя как в сказке. Энергетика этого места удивительна.

Отель находится на холме, с которого открывается невероятный вид на океан, рядом 2 пляжа: одна лагуна спокойная, в 2-х минутах ходьбы от отеля и 10 минут пешком до сайлент-бич с бурными волнами, зайти в которые решится не каждый, при этом прогуляться по этому пляжу -особое удовольствие. В отеле просто необходимо брать завтраки и ужины -все невероятно вкусно и все это в ресторане с видом на океан. Персонал отеля -выще всяких похвал, помогут в любой ситуации, если вы обратитесь с вопросом или пожеланием. Управляющий Асанка всегда максимально вежлив и внимателен, создает ощущение, что вы самый долгожданный гость, проявляя внимание к каждому. В этот отель хочется вернуться. Практически каждый вечер играет живая музыка и поют музыканты, владелец отеля -мистер Нуван неравнодушен к музыке и даже сам поет для гостей отеля, интересуется у гостей есть ли у них нарекания или пожелания к сервису. В отеле царит домашняя уютная атмосфера с вниманием и заботой к каждому гостю.

Мы жили в королевском сьюте на самом верхнем этаже отеля, из которого открывался невероятный вид, и каждое утро на крышу прилетал павлин с традиционным приветствием криком.","отдохновение для души и тела","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r993994712-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Если в общем - то отель выше всех похвал! Хотя, тут и так уже очень много хвалебных отзывов, но они заслуживают того, чтобы и мой стал одним из них) 

Главная ценность отеля - сотрудники во главе с Асанкой. Тебя просто окутывают заботой и вниманием. Весь персонал очень доброжелательный, внимательный, небезразличный и улыбчивый! На просьбы реагируют быстро. Управляющий Асанка … о нем очень много хорошего уже сказано… Всё это правда! Мистер Нуван (владелец) тоже каждый вечер присутствовал на ужинах и брал  обратную связь.

Самое главное, что стоит знать при мука�� выбора отеля: тут нет вечернего променада, туристических магазинов, ларьков, толп и прочего. В Тангелле тоже. Тут ты сливаешься с местными. Никто из них к тебе не пристает, все и всюду только мило улыбаются, ничего не прося взамен.

А теперь по-порядку) 
Это место для тех, кто:
- устал от суеты повседневной жизни и хочет тишины, покоя и романтики уединения с максимальным комфортом;
- не боится лестниц и подъемом, они повсюду в отеле и по дороге на пляж;
- любит созерцать и просыпаться под пение птиц и шум океана. Зелень, зверушки (бурундуки, павлины жили на балконе), вид на океан потрясающий;
- устал от бездушных, переполненных сетевых отелей.  

Отель:
- при 100% загрузки гости каким-то образом распределяются так, что видят друг-друга только в ресторане; 
- уборка ежедневно.  Полы мыли, полотенца, постель меняли, воду давали. Халатов нет, вместо тапочек шлепанцы (новые). Делали все качественно, претензий за 10 дней не было; 
- ребята в ресторане шуршат как пчелки! Мое восхищение! 
- спа, вот прям рекомендую комплексный массаж (90мин);
- страшной живности не встречали, территория ухоженная;
- переживали за стройку зря. Не мешает);
- матрац, подушки - очень удобные. Белье/полотенца чистые и белые. 

Пляжи:
- Сайлент действительно прекрасен!  Мин 15 пешком, либо на бесплатном тук-туке. По дороге встречаются обезьяны, варан и пр прикольная живность. В самом начале не плохое кафе с шезлонгами. Но мы ходили в конец, вода спокойнее и атмосфера приятнее. Еда/напитки везде +- одинаковые;
- второй маленький, прям рядом. С серферами и вкусным ресторанчиком Aga. 

Еда: 
- завтрак. Ежедневно на тепане: глазунья, омлет, панкейки с бананом и шоколадом. Также всегда была овсянка на молоке, рис, что-то из горячего, выпечки и десертов много, соки (очень вкусные) и прочее. Ничего этакого, и всегда одно и тоже, но это ведь завтрак, что тут еще придумаешь; 
- ужин. Разнообразный, каждый день новые блюда, морепродукты (креветки, кальмары, рыба, крабы)  готовят при вас, салатов видов пять, курица всегда, гарниры тоже разных видов, десерты, фрукты в изобилии. Все очень вкусно;
- по аля-кард +- тоже самое, что и на ужин.

Развлечения:
- два бассейна, у ресторана играет не навязчивая музыка, у основного, ярусом ниже, только тишина и покой;
- на ужине всегда играют очень хорошие музыканты! С удовольствием провели все вечера с ними

P.S. 
Это был замечательный отдых, очень уютный и расслабляющий! Будто приехал к любящим родственникам)","Замечательный отдых!","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r992162956-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Перед поездкой подробно изучили всю информацию, поэтому никаких сюрпризов для нас не было. По приезду нас радушно встретили на ресепшн с цветами и приветственным кокосовым напитком. Мы приехали раньше времени заселения, но номер был предоставлен сразу.
Жили в семейном номере на первом этаже с большой террасой и двумя отдельными комнатами. В номере есть всё, что необходимо, нареканий нет. Была проблема с переходниками на розетках, сразу же принесли другие.
Питание разнообразное. На завтрак много выпечки, яйца, бекон, сосиски, блинчики с бананом и шоколадом, молочная каша, фрукты, свежевыжатые соки, йогурт... всего не перечесть. На ужин ежедневно креветки, кальмары, тунец на гриле. Можно попросить, и специально для вас приготовят рыбу, которую вы сами выберете. Из гарниров рис, картофель, макароны, овощи. Можно каждый день питаться по-разному.
Во время нашего проживания отель был полностью заполнен, но при этом шезлонги у бассейнов всегда находили. Пляжные полотенца можно взять в барах у бассейнов.
Океан прекрасен! Вода тёплая, чистая и прозрачная. Мы предпочитали пляж у отеля, так как на нём почти не бывает волн, удобно купаться с детьми и делать заплывы. Там же несколько раз обедали в кафе Aga. Не дёшево, но вкусно и порции большие.
Пляж Silent Beach поражает своей красотой. Попадаешь в райский уголок, глаз не оторвать. Но купание с детьми там затруднительно, большие волны.
Также ездили на пляж Гоямбокка. Он не уступает красотой Silent. Есть не большие волны, но мы без проблем купались всей семьёй.
А теперь о главном... В отеле царит такая атмосфера доброты, заботы и любви, что с первого дня начинаешь ощущать себя, как в кругу семьи. Сотрудники очень стараются угодить каждому гостю, интересуются как проходит отдых, на какие экскурсии ездили, есть ли проблемы или пожелания. И это не для ""галочки"", чувствуется искренность. Они сами счастливы, когда счастливы их гости.
А эти чудесные душевные ужины под живую музыку! Полный релакс души и тела! Нигде ранее я не встречала, чтобы хозяин отеля уделял внимание каждому гостю, пел песни и создавал такую уютную атмосферу.
И никакая стройка не помешает вашему отдыху, тем более даже нам на первом этаже её абсолютно не было слышно. Очень жду, когда достроят новые корпуса, чтобы вернуться и посмотреть на новый облик отеля.
Уезжали со слезами на глазах и до сих пор душой всё ещё там. С некоторыми сотрудниками отеля поддерживаем связь. Очень добрые и искренние люди живут на Шри-Ланке.
Огромное спасибо мистеру Ньювану, Асанке, Хасите и всей команде отеля Mayavee за незабываемый отдых. Желаем вам дальнейшего процветания и с нетерпением ждём новой встречи!","Отель, который покорит ваше сердце...","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r990263233-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

И как же чудесно, что мечты сбываются! Отель настолько покорил своей красотой, безупречным сервисом, добрыми, отзывчивыми людьми, что решив лететь вновь на Шри-Ланку, выбирать другое место, даже мысли не было!!! Только Mayavee!!!
В этот раз прилетели в  Коломбо, дорога до отеля заняла 2,5 часа, очень комфортно! В отеле  нас встретили как самых дорогих гостей, родных людей!!! Безумно были рады увидеть вновь Асанку, который стал уже нашим  другом, Мистера Ньювана, остальных ребят отеля и так приятно, когда к тебе подходят и говорят, что нас помнят еще с прошлого года!!!
Заселили нас в шикарный номер с 3 спальнями, джакузи, великолепной террасой с видом на океан!!! Нашему счастью не было предела!!!  Белоснежное постельное белье и мягкие, пушистые полотенца, удобные подушки, всегда приятный запах в номере ! 
7 января был потрясающий салют в честь Рождества и вкуснейший праздничный ужин! Ужины в отеле  всегда чудесные! Свежайшая рыба, которую специально для вас приготовят, крабы, креветки, кальмары, кусочки нежнейшего тунца, рис, паста, супы! Все очень вкусно! Бесподобные экзотические фрукты! Каждый вечер за ужином была живая  музыка, пели приглашенные певцы, которые запомнились нам еще с прошлого раза! Милая девушка даже пела песню Земфиры на русском! Так трогательно! Единственное мое  замечание это то, что в этот раз Мистер Ньюван ,в силу своей занятости ,не пел так часто, как в прошлом году, но когда пел,  это было восхитительно!!! 👏👏👏 с душой, неподдельными эмоциями! 
Во время отдыха отметила свой день рождения и очень благодарна персоналу отеля за незабываемый праздник, чудесные эмоции и подарки! Этот день навсегда останется в моей памяти как лучший день рождения! Спасибо!!!
Сервис в отеле всегда на высшем уровне! Тарелочку с едой всегда ребята донесут, стульчик придвинут, грязные тарелки на столе дольше 5 секунд не задерживаются! Во всем чувствуется забота о вас, желание, чтобы ваш отдых прошел незабываемо ! 
В отеле встречала семьи, которые возвращаются сюда  третий-четвертый раз!!! Для меня это самый лучший показатель того, что и хозяин отеля ,и главный менеджер отеля Асанка , и весь персонал  все делают правильно и не ради хороших отзывов, а искренне от всего сердца!!!! И я абсолютно уверена, что ни в одном другом месте, такой заботы и такого безупречного сервиса, неподдельного желания угодить гостям, сделать их счастливым, мы больше не встретим! 
Забота о гостях проявлялась даже в самых мелочах, персонал как будто читает твои мысли, стоит только подумать о чем-то, это уже исполнено! 
Во многом, конечно, заслуга Асанки!!! Он очень старается! Он не только профессиональный менеджер, но и добрейшей души человек, заботливый, добрый, отзывчивый! 
Всегда очень занят, но находит время подойти, спросить, все ли хорошо, какие планы на день! Видит, утром мы на пляж собираемся, всегда поинтересуется, нужен ли тук-тук, а мог бы просто пожелать хорошего дня  и пройти мимо!
Наши детки любили купаться во время ужина и мне приходилось вставать из-за стола периодически , посматрива��ь , Асанка это заметил и на следующий ужин уже возле бассейна стояла милая девочка из персонала, присматривала за ними, подавала полотенца, все, чтобы родители смогли полноценно отдохнуть! Когда муж с сыном уехали на 2 дня на экскурсию, Асанка всегда был на связи с водителем, волновался, все ли хорошо, все ли им нравится! 
Мы прилетели 5 января и в этот же вечер Мистер Ньюван  подошел к нам, поболтали, я спросила, почему так рано убрали елку, Рождество ведь скоро! Он передал Асанке и на следующий день за завтраком елка стояла ))) здесь мне стало немного не удобно ))) Но такое отношение к гостям подкупает и заставляет возвращаться именно в этот отель!
Да, в отеле идет стройка!Отель растет, расширяется, чтобы стать еще лучше, у Мистера Ньювана грандиозные планы! Но очень хочется отметить, что за все 14 ночей никакого шума от стройки слышно не было! Ребята выходят в 10 утра, заканчивают в 6-7 вечера, но все делается очень тихо, стройку видно из бассейна или когда идешь по дорожке, но абсолютно не слышно ! Никого шума перфоратора или отбойника вы не услышите! Никак на отдыхе это не отразится и не точно его не испортит! 
Отель находится на возвышенности, кому не удобно подниматься , всегда можно воспользоваться бесплатным тук-туком от отеля до пляжа, стоит только написать в вацап! Вообще, все вопросы, которые возникают, решаются буквально одним сообщением! Персонал реагирует  молниеносно на все просьбы и пожелания!!!! 
 Очень жалко, что время в отпуске бежит так быстро, уезжали мы и дети со слезами на глазах, но греет мысль, что всегда можно купить билет, написать Асанке , забронировать номер и вновь очутиться в этом лучшем месте на земле!!! ❤️","Наше возвращение в отель!

номер брали стандартный. о чем пожалели по прибытии,нам предоставили номер без балкона.  За доп плату поменяли на номер с балконом, все номера выходят на море, наш w07  на нижнем этаже,немного неудобно как в пещере. Но в следующий раз  брали бы номер на 4 этаже, там номера с терраса  и бассейн,  они дороже, но лучше. В номере нет зеркала в комнате и мало вешалок, надеюсь этот мелкий недостаток устранят)
Отель Mayavee расположен на горе, поэтому путь на пляж не совсем идеален. тук тук отвезёт и заберет на пляж сайленс, на нем очень большие волны, так красиво,  но купаться не всегда удастся. 
Без авто и мотоцикла в этом отеле делать нечего.
Но.... администратору огромный респект все вопросы решают мгновенно и идеально
нужна машина через час она у тебя
мопед, держите
деньги поменять через час привезут
в номер принести что-то без проблем, заказать еду которой нет на шведский стол держите.
в общем  клиентоориентированность идеальная, 10 из 10!!!! молодцы 
еда вкусная, кофе шикарный.
на стройке маленькие щенятки, кто поедет не забывайте их кормить! стройка не мешает проживанию, кстати. 
Очень понравилось отношение как к лучшему гостю, обязательно приедем ещё в этот отель.
Спасибо Асанке, Джане и всему персоналу. Вы молодцы!!!

Путь от аэропорта Коломбо до отеля занял порядка 5 часов, но это особенность трансфера. Думаю на такси можно было бы доехать в два раза быстрее точно, но цена будет кусаться.
От дороги до самого отеля нас довезли на тук туке, так как проехать большому транспорту туда затруднительно.
Мы приехали поздно вечером, нас приветливо встретили на ресепшен, дали теплые полотенца, что было прямо супер с долгой дороги, надели на шею бусы из цветов, угостили кокосом - очень приятно!
Заселили ровно в тот номер, который и бронировали, никуда переселяться не предлагали, так как начался сезон и номера категорией выше (sea view) были заняты.
Сам отель и его территория в архитектурном плане выглядят просто невероятно - постройка гениальна, это единение с природой, открытые террасы и потрясающие виды на океан (обязательно погуляйте по отелю - можно найти весьма любопытные закоулки).
В отеле имеются два бассейна с видом на океан.
Номера уютные, чистые, в ванной комнате есть гигиенические наборы, шампунь, гель для душа, бальзам, фен, сейф, в ящике две пары сланцев, в розетку уже вставлен жидкий фумигатор от насекомых.
Мы убирали документы и деньги по разным местам, в том числе и в сейф, но, откровенно говоря, по ощущениям - если бы мы все оставили посредине номера, оно бы так и осталось там лежать. Такую вот атмосферу создает персонал отеля.
Розетки местные не предназначены для наших вилок, но ничего не берите с собой и не покупайте там, вопрос решается элементарно, просто почитайте информацию в интернете (кстати их переходники искрят, не советую ими пользоваться).
За время проживания ни один комар не побеспокоил, но были ящерицы (совершенно не мешали), а один раз обнаружили паука, но оказалось, что это хороший паук, домовой.
От комаров можете купить в любой аптеке Цитронеллу, хорошее средство, свое можно не везти, оно тут, говорят, не работает.
WiFi в отеле чуть слабоват, поэтому купите в аэропорту симку оператора Dialog - тариф туристический, стоимость 2400rs и у вас безлимитный Watsapp, который здесь в ходу, 50гб на интернет и будете на связи всегда и практически везде.
Есть тарифы дешевле, это уж как понравится.
Все работники реально очень вежливые, всегда поздороваются, всегда уступят дорогу, помогут донести вещи.
Уборка каждый день.
У нас были завтраки и ужины, обед брать не стали, так как в такую жару вместо обеда можно просто перекусить каким нибудь фруктом.
Завтраки плюс минус однообразные, но так как мы не привередливы, то ели, что есть, голодными не уходили никогда, все вкусно и сытно.
Ужины в целом тоже однообразные, но опять же - мы наедались без проблем, даже если приходили под конец ужина.
Еда вся не острая, если хочется острого - оно все подписано.
Приготовлено все реально очень вкусно - от основных блюд до выпечки/сладостей.
Сотрудники ресторана проведут к столику, подвинут вам стул, донесут тарелку с едой, предложат напитки.
Дополнительно можно попросить приготовить морепродукты, выложенные на столе со льдом, также можно попросить напитки, в том числе алкогольные - но, как мы поняли, это все за доп плату, поэтому кроме чая в принципе довольствовались соками, да водой.
Из напитков постоянно были свежевыжатый соки, а последние дни мы подсели на айс кофе, это очень вкусно - все бесплатно.
Из фруктов были арбуз, папайя, яблоки, апельсины, мандарины, бананы желтые и красные, что то еще экзотическое; особо отмечу ананасы - сладкие, сочные, очень вкусные.
Папайей только не увлекайтесь, она слабит ;)
Манго, кстати, не было и в ближайших лавках его также не было. Нашли в центре острова, когда были на экскурсии. Вроде как еще не сезон был.
Также есть мороженное.
Через несколько дней проживания удалось сменить наш номер на номер с видом на океан и балконом - виды просто невероятные, особенно закаты! Плюсом просто гигантская ванная комната со вторым светом - выглядит очень прикольно.
Что особо понравилось - на все время пребывания отель действительно стал нашим другом.
Все вопросы решаются оперативно - заказать тук тук, арендовать байк, разменять деньги и вообще любой вопрос отель решал без проблем, если не своими силами, то силами посредников (если говорить об аренде байка, например).
Курс обмена в отеле, между прочим, ничем не отличался от курса в аэропорту, поэтому даже голову не ломали -  меняли в отеле по мере необходимости.
Отель доступен как напрямую через ресепшен, так и через Watsapp (мы общались на английском и он у многих такой себе, не очень, но у главного менеджера с этим проблем нет, если что - переводчик вам в помощь).
В связи с вышесказанным хочется особо отметить работу менеджера ресепшен Janandi - все общение в основном было через нее.
А в ресторане был сотрудник по имени Keshara, до чего позитивный и улыбчивый парень!
Всегда старался позаботиться о нас, а мы всегда были искренне рады его заботе!
Также за ужином регулярно присутствовал хозяин отеля мистер Nuwan, который периодически интересовался как у нас дела и все ли нам нравится.
За ужином играет живая музыка, где поет и сам мистер Nuwan.
И слава богам - никаких анимаций, дискотек и караоке, ужин закончился и в 10 вечера тишина, просто идеально!
Если вы уезжаете куда то утром, вам выдадут с собой ланч бокс.
Около отеля расположены два пляжа - Unakuruwa beach и Silent beach.
Прошу заметить - подъем/спуск к отелю весьма круты, но для молодежи, думаю, с этим проблем быть не должно. 
А если имеются какие то ограничения по здоровью, то можно попросить в отеле тук тук, они бесплатно довезут до пляжа.
До первого пляжа идти 5 минут, купаться там можно без проблем, волны были, но прямо совсем не критичные.
В отличие от Silent beach, где за все время искупаться не удалось, волны очень большие. Поэтому он для созерцания и медитации. Ну и так как людей реально нет, то вам доступна километровая, пляжная, пустая фотозона с потрясающими закатами и рассветами - рекомендую.
На основной дороге имеется какой-то магазинчик, но мы там не были, возможно там есть что то в минимальной необходимости.
По пути в город Тангалле, есть пара сувенирных магазинчиков, так вот там цены в несколько раз выше, чем в самом Тангалле!
Поэтому не поленитесь, возьмите тук тук за 500-600rs до города и погуляйте там, посмотрите - мы нашли все сувениры именно в городе. 
Алкоголь также продается только в городе, в Winestore (ну как «store», скорее это похоже на ларек из 90-х в переулке, но там все есть:)). Ром Калипсо, 0,7, 5100rs.
В целом не ленитесь - погуляйте пешочком от отеля по пляжам направо, потом налево - вы увидите такие локации, от которых дух захватывает - длиннейшая коса пляжа и ни одного человека (но хочу предупредить - с пляжа на пляж просто так не перейти, можно конечно идти по дороге, но мы лазали по камням, это очень классное приключение, но не для всех, рассчитывайте свои силы - порой лазать приходилось очень круто).
На Unakuruwa beach рекомендую обратить внимание на вывеску Thilak surfing school - это если захочется поучиться серфингу. Thilak классный парень, профессионал, за 2 занятия смог обучить стоять на доске и ловить волну!
Из лекарств возьмите с собой кучу пластырей, клей БФ и хлоргексидин или перекись - плоховато заживают тут раны и царапины.
Мажтесь spf 50, солнце тут очень коварное. От солнечных ожогов рекомендую купить здесь же что нибудь с 98% алоэ - помогает супер, проверено.
Ну и напоследок - все положительные отзывы о данном отеле действительно правдивы. В связи с чем у меня также возникали большие сомнения по поводу их достоверности во время бронирования. 
Но абсолютно все сомнения были развеяны и я с уверенностью могу рекомендовать этот отель к проживанию!
В последний день хозяин отеля вручил нам пачку чая и фигурку слона :)
Кстати, советую в ответ привезти что нибудь с собой - мы привозили шоколад и небольшие безделушки - они будут рады!
Все написанные мной тут цены в рупиях (rs) - на момент поездки, 2024г., можно эти цены делить на 3 и получите цену в рублях.
Всем хорошего отдыха!
И главное - улыбайтесь!

P.s. Весьма и весьма рекомендую гида, мистера Keerthi, человек в возрасте, русский знает отлично, вежливый, пунктуальный, интеллектуал.

They’ve done such a great job keeping the natural surroundings intact—it really feels like you’re tucked into nature. My son was in heaven exploring and spotting frogs and lizards around the property. The garden is a lovely touch too.

We stayed for 4 nights and honestly wished we had more time. The rooms are spacious, beautifully designed, and have everything you need—including a super comfortable bed that made it hard to get up in the mornings! We also used the laundry service during our stay, and it was quick and efficient, which was so helpful.

We didn’t eat a single meal off the property because everything at the hotel was just that good. We had breakfast and lunch there every day, and every dish we tried was absolutely delicious. Big compliments to the chef—every meal felt like something to look forward to. We personally don’t eat dinner, otherwise we would’ve happily eaten dinner on the property too!

We also made the most of the pool, hot tub, and steam room—they were all so relaxing and refreshing. We also had a blast with the archery and air gun, and loved that there were bikes available to ride. One morning, we took the bikes all the way to Sigiriya Rock, which was such a fun and memorable adventure. It’s little extras like these that made our stay feel really special.

What really stood out, though, was the kindness and warmth of the staff. Every single person—from the front desk to the restaurant team to the gardeners—was so friendly, helpful, and welcoming. They made us feel completely at home.

We’re in Sri Lanka for almost a month, and we actually looked into coming back to Forest Edge for the last 5 nights of our trip… but it’s fully booked, and we’re honestly so bummed! We had the best time there and would go back in a heartbeat.","Nature, Comfort, and Kindness All in One Place","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d11912874-r1013899540-Sigiriya_Forest_Edge_By_Marino_Leisure-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

The staff were very welcoming and polite, and there was an extremely courteous and pleasant server at the restaurant named Sajeewa who served us for dinner and breakfast. We also spoke with the Head Chef of the resort's restaurant, Kavindu, who is young yet produces delicious food one after the other. The wide range of options from the set menu, either the three-course Asian menu or the four-course menu, didn't fail to satisfy us at all. 
The resort is situated just 15 minutes from the Sigiriya Lion Rock, for which it also offers a shuttle service, and is conveniently close to other attractions. The free Wi-Fi was well spread throughout the resort and was extremely fast, which was very helpful.

The restaurant in the resort serve a huge, delicious breakfast. They also have lunch and dinner available.  We went to town yo try other restaurants,  but we discovered that the restaurant at Sigiriya Forest Edge served the best food. Our best meals in Sri Lanka for our whole month stay were from there. The curry fish is the most delicious! Kotu and chicken curry were fantastic!

They offer transportation service for a very reasonable fee. We used their car service to go to Sigiriya Rock, Dambulla Cave Temple and Polonnaruwa.  Just needed to reserve the day before. The driver is great, took us where we needed to go and waited for us. Offered cool face cloths and cold water after the hikes.

We're delighted to hear that your stay at Wallawwa was such a memorable one, even if all too brief. It’s great to know you enjoyed the little touches in the room and the peaceful moments by the pool and in the library—we truly believe it’s those details that help make a stay special.

It was described as an airport hotel, however I would say it's definitely nicer than this. It was a calm oasis that allowed us to relax after a very long flight. 

The room was comfortable and felt luxurious with a huge bathroom. It did smell a bit musty, but this might have been due to the rainy weather. 

The pool area was a bit disappointing, it felt uncared for and very buggy. Again, this could have been weather related. 

We had some incredible food here - a delicious evening meal and also complimentary afternoon tea. The house curry plate was the best!

Thank you so much for this wonderful review! 

We're absolutely thrilled to hear that Wallawwa was the perfect first stop on your Teardrop journey. It’s lovely to know you enjoyed the peaceful setting, thoughtful activities, and spacious family room — and even more so that your children felt welcome too. We’re especially happy the wetlands boat trip, cooking demo, and massage added something special to your stay. 

Wishing you safe travels and may your adventures be truly remarkable.

Sincerely,

Sakuni Wisanperuma

We had a family room and it was great. Really clean, spacious, quiet and beautifully decorated. 
We stayed at 5 teardrop hotels (they are all fantastic) and did a Teardrop Journey - which I REALLY recommend.
Our journey included many activities. At Wallawwa we did the wetlands boat trip which was beautiful and peaceful, the cooking demonstration which was a great introduction to Sri Lankan food and had a fantastic massage.
The staff were very friendly and great with our kids.
The grounds and pool were beautiful.
We loved it at Wallawwa and definitely recommend it.","Fantastic! Highly recommend","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1990730-d1380568-r1002928814-Wallawwa-Kotugoda_Western_Province.html",

You can also do yoga, spa session, cooking demo class and many others. Perfect place for everything you need! You should definitely stay here while being in Kandy.

From the moment we arrived (after a long drive and sight seeing on the way) we were so well taken care of right from check-in.  They greeted us with refreshments and took care of all of our belongings.  The rooms were so spacious we could have entertained a party of 10 easily, but it was only 4 adults in our group.  The general manager Mr. Sumanasekara treated us like his own family.  The way he treats his staff is the same way.  You can tell it's a family vibe that extends to the guests with such attention given to us by their staff.  
The views from the dining area are breathtaking.
On our journey we had been disappointed with a cooking class we had taken at a spice garden.  Upon hearing our frustrations, the hotel organized a private cooking class and luncheon for us.  We made classic Sri Lankan dishes like coconut sambol, shrimp curry, mushroom and carrots, lentils, rice, green beams.  The chef and staff went over the top in making the experience a highlight of our trip.

My main complaint:  this is too large/commercial a property with 28 or so rooms.  It feels crowded with people, and there are a large number of children,,.some of whom were delightful.  But too often parents take no responsibility for them.  I saw parents allow children to jump off bridges over the pool and loudly splash and bother other guests in the bar and dining area;   I saw an approx 6 year old boy get ignored by parents and wander down to the beach into the water that everyone is told is off limits due to dangerous surf and currents.  Luckily the alert staff stepped in quickly in both cases.  The cabins cannot be faulted for comfortable beds and excellent equipment...but they definitely have a very strong steampunk design that seems quaint in 2025.  Overall, I don't think this property lives up to it's billing.  It's not a luxury wilderness lodge, its a family resort.  I'd recommend the Uga Chena Huts for a more quiet and lodge-like experience.","There's a better choice IMO","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r1000768348-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

What an amazing place. They have set the theme just right. It was quite a drive from where we had come from and the staff were waiting with cold drinks, flannels and sorbet! 

We stayed in the cocoon suite, and it was superb. Everything you need, you wouldn’t think you were in a tented room, it was massive! We had rain for most of our stay, which was a challenge sometimes, but the noise in the tent put you to sleep at night! 

We also had several ‘Game Drives’ with a Ranger & Driver. Both were excellent. Their knowledge about the animals and locations was spot on. We were lucky enough to see a leopard as well as elephants, crocodiles and many birds. 

The staff are amazing. They are so helpful and pleasant, they make you feel at home. I cannot praise them enough. 

If it’s a safari you’re after and want to get into that Theme, there’s no better place to stay.","Fantastic for a Sri Lankan Safari","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r997244545-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

As a family of seasoned travelers, having spent the past 30 years exclusively staying in 5-star hotels and visiting some of the most exotic and prestigious resorts worldwide, we had high expectations for Wild Coast Tented Lodge. After spending four nights here from February 7 to February 11, I can confidently say that this lodge is an absolute gem- seamlessly blending wilderness, adventure, and ultra-luxury hospitality.

1. Exceptional People -  The Heart of the Lodge

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed by some of the warmest and most professional staff we ve encountered anywhere in the world. A special mention goes to our butler, Sandaruwan, who went above and beyond to ensure every moment of our stay was effortless and personal. Equally impressive was our game ranger, Saranga, whose deep knowledge of the Yala National Park, sharp tracking skills, and infectious enthusiasm made our safaris unforgettable.

2. The Breathtaking Location

Perched on the edge of Yala National Park, this lodge offers a truly magical setting, with its dramatic rock formations, dense jungle, and the vast Indian Ocean in the background. The integration of the lodge into the landscape is seamless, making you feel completely immersed in nature while enjoying the highest levels of comfort.

3. World-Class Dining- “ A Culinary Masterpiece “.

One of the standout experiences was undoubtedly the food. Every meal from the elaborate breakfasts to the exquisite lunches and dinners was a showcase of gourmet craftsmanship. The flexibility of the kitchen in mixing and matching dishes was highly appreciated, allowing us to explore different flavors without restrictions.
The ice creams and sorbets were to die for and easily among the best weve had anywhere.
The mixed seafood platter was a revelation better than what you would expect at a Michelin-starred restaurant!
The attention to detail in flavors, presentation, and freshness made every meal an event in itself.

4. Luxurious tented suites with Private Plunge Pools

The accommodations redefine the idea of a Tent .These are stunning, spacious, and beautifully designed luxury suites, each with its own private plunge pool overlooking a waterhole where we spotted wild animals coming to drink. The blend of elegance and wilderness creates an atmosphere of serenity that is hard to match.

5. Unmatched Value in the Luxury Segment

Considering the level of personalized service, unique setting, and unparalleled quality of food and accommodation, Wild Coast Tented Lodge delivers exceptional value for money in the high-end safari market. It stands at par with the best Aman resorts we have visited, making it a top-tier luxury experience.

Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

While our experience was near-perfect, there are a few refinements that could elevate it even further:

1. Game Drive Snacks & Food: Given how extraordinary the full-board dining experience is, the snacks and food provided on game drives felt underwhelming. This was surprising, considering the culinary excellence of the lodges main restaurant. A more fun, creative selection would better reflect the overall food standard.

2. Additional Activities Beyond Game Drives:
While we saw elephants, buffalos, leopards, and a great variety of birds, the game density and variety are not comparable to Africas top safari destinations.
The lodge should offer a range of alternative activities such as yoga, nature walks, and cooking classes to diversify the experience for guests.

3. Sunset Sundowners - More Cozy & Timed Better:
The current sundowners feel a bit too spread out over a large area, making them less intimate.
The timing should be adjusted to start at 6:00 PM instead of 5:30 PM to allow guests returning from afternoon game drives to enjoy them properly.

Final Verdict : Among Our Top 10 Resorts !

Despite these small areas for improvement, Wild Coast Tented Lodge stands as one of our top 10 resort experiences worldwide. It is an unforgettable destination that brings together luxury, adventure, and exceptional hospitality in a truly spectacular setting.

For anyone looking for a high-end experience in Sri-Lanka ,  with world-class service, food, and accommodation, this lodge is an absolute must-visit. Highly recommended!

The lodge is so beautiful and peaceful. The area is so unspoiled. It is a very rare find. The resort is completely uncrowded. We were the only ones in the pool when we used it and the whole place has a very limited number of guests,  so you feel like you are kind of alone in nature. 
The services were incredible. We had one staff member available to us at all times if we had a question or concern. Benali was delightful. 

Our Safari could not have been better. Saranga is an incredible Ranger, who knew how to find all sorts of creatures and how to explain things. He also clearly took such joy in the area and the nature around us. We learned a lot about Sri Lanka‘s wildlife and history. I went with my three adult children and we had our own Jeep and the same Ranger for all three Safaris.  That made a huge difference because he knew what we’d seen and what we like. 

The food is a phenomenon in itself. It rivaled the best four-star restaurant in New York City. It was constantly delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented. The wide variety of eating times, courses and options was incredible. Sundowners on the beach was lovely.

The accommodations were also lovely. One night we got to hear the rain on the roof. One day an elephant was outside the restaurant. This stressed the staff a bit, but was kind of delightful and we felt safe. We loved the plunge pool and the design of the cocoons. My son and his wife stayed in one part of the family cocoon and my adult daughter and I stayed in the other and it was quite fine for two adults.

The location is fantastic with the untamed ocean visible from the dining room and great to look at on the beach, though of course you are not allowed to swim, and they do everything to ensure your safety.

When I first booked this holiday, it seemed very expensive but when you see all that is included, it is so well worth it. We didn’t have to think about what we were ordering or whether we wanted a glass of wine at our cocoon. We didn’t have to decide how many safaris we wanted to go on. My understanding is that at nearby places you pay for the Safari separately.

It was definitely the trip of a lifetime but I hope I get to go back another time!","Best holiday ever!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r992366159-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

When arriving we expected a five star resort in a great location, what met us was an experience of wild nature with delicately embedded luxury. It was like being part of nature, and stepping in to our room made you feel like being Indiana Jones. 

Every detail of the resort have been meticulously designed and crafted, there is a thought behind every detail. Like the balancing stones and the shape of the main building mimicking some stones down on the beach. To much to summarize in this review.

Of a consistently high standard is the warm friendly welcome upon arrival and meeting Kavi our Curator.

The property is astounding  - how it integrates seamlessly with nature. Our pool ‘Cocoon’ accommodation was stunning - exquisitely decorated and such a comfortable haven in the middle of the jungle.

From our first experience which were Sundowners on the Beach where we met the staff and the rangers, it already felt like home.

The food was exceptional and so beautifully presented and service was impeccable.

Our highlight were are safari drives - in fact 3 in total as we booked an extra one as we loved it so much. We were so fortunate to have the dynamic duo - Darshan ( Driver) and Darshan Mohan ( Guide/ Ranger/ Naturalist. We had so much fun with these two and were fortunate to see so much of the wildlife who call Yala home including the elephants and 2 male Leopard cubs who came within about 5 metres of us. My heart  slipped a beat and I could not believe my eyes. It was a moment I will never forget.

Darshana Mohan was so passionate about Yala and so knowledgeable. It was so educational and entertaining. All the while keeping us comfortable and safe.

Also thank you to Buddhi who provided details on a turtle hatchery and a location for snorkeling  when we travelled to our next stop which was WELIGAMA.

I can’t rate Wild Coast Tented Safari more highly.

You get your own little private pool in the jungle as well. Just lie back and listen to the sounds. 
Everything is of a great quality. 
The staff (Sashi especially) , were fantastic and looked after our every need. 
The game drives are amazing. We did an afternoon one and an early morning one. Great knowledgeable guide who explained everything.  You get the same guide so no overlap in the experience. The jeeps only hold 6 in the back so you all have a fantastic outside view. We saw just about everything bar the Sloth Bear. 
It is worth remembering the the site is in the jungle and there are no fences keeping wildlife out. You are escorted after dark for your own safety but that just adds to the vibe and the excitement. 
The food was delicious. Not your typical buffet fare when you stay all inclusive. You order from a menu and it’s cooked fresh. We had the seafood platter on the first night and it was amazing. Fillet steak the second night, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Absolutely not complaints here.

Wild Coast Tented Lodge was our final of three resort destinations owned by Resplendent Ceylon, after 11 days previously split between their Cape Weligama beach resort and Ceylon Tea Trails experience.
Arriving at this Relais & Chateau base for our Sri Lanka safari provided the usual personalised welcome that we had become familiar with, the General Manager was there to greet us and introduce our stay curator. This was to be a short one-night stay so after arriving by seaplane we had in mind a relaxed lunch followed by an afternoon massage, with a game drive early the next day.
On the topic of the massage, curiously my Balinese masseuse Manda appeared vaguely familiar. Coincidentally it was her Mum “Mega” who massaged me several times during our earlier visit to Cape Weligama! One does sense that the Dilmah family-owned Resplendent Ceylon Resorts prioritise employee wellbeing. At all levels of responsibility from the gardeners, housekeepers, restaurant waiters and management, their visitor facing staff seem very happy, enthusiastic, and proud of their work.
The tented “cocoons” are astonishing, comfortable architectural masterpieces. Constructed using the most sustainable processes and materials they comprise a bamboo structure, covered with insulated stretch tented fabric, are fully air conditioned with all the modern plumbing and sanitary functions, four poster bed with top quality linen and towels. Our cocoon featured a private swimming pool and deck area that was delightful to freshen up after our journey.
The safari was well executed, we previously experienced several in Africa against which the attention and quality of the game drive in Sri Lanka compared well. We had been a little spoiled having seen all the “big 5” animals in Africa, but the game drive whilst not offering such a huge variety of beasts as Africa fully met our expectations. Our nominated ranger, the six feet tall “Evinka” was very informative and passionate about his work, we always felt safe, and he managed to get us within 3 metres of a mother and baby elephant, he well communicated in such an enjoyable way.  Other highlights were beautiful Peacocks dancing, Crocodiles resting, and lots of colourful wild birds.
Back at the Tented Lodge we enjoyed a classic English breakfast, even served with my favourite HP source which I had mentioned to the Resplendent Travel booking agent at the time of our reservation. Resplendent facilitated the “vital sauce” was available for us at every breakfast during our multi-destination 12-night visit!  In general at Wild Coast Tented Lodge, we found the food quality and offering to be of an acceptable standard. Although not the level of fine dining we experienced at Ceylon Tea Trails where it is a major focus, here the “jungle” experience is the main feature and this fully met our expectations.
We were so inspired by our “cocoon bathroom” that we decided to incorporate the design and plumbing into our never-ending home renovation back in Mediterranean Europe!","Luxury in the jungle","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r989772653-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Its location within the national park means that movement is very restricted on foot so if you enjoy a walk along the sand dunes you will not get far without being turned back by security. Elephants and other animals pass by regularly and you need to be escorted to your tent and back by staff. 

The tent pods and decks are cute and well kitted out although if you f joy the sound of the waves or fresh air turn tough, because you can’t open any windows. 

Our safari ranger was excellent and we visited two parts of the park. Block One is extremely busy with jeeps whilst the other was less so. We did see a leopard, friendly and unfriendly elephants; wild boar; grey monkeys; herds of spotted deer and the odd sambar deer. There were also a few fresh water crocs. We saw evidence of bears but did not see one.

The service was speedy, friendly and efficient, and the game drive vehicles and conservationist guide were top notch.  
My only complaints (and the reason for a four star, rather than five star review) would be the live music on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were overly loud, making it difficult to chat with family; the restaurant seemed understaffed for holiday dinners, and the limited menu could have provided better for vegetarians; and there was a lack of indoor common areas (beside the pool) to enjoy chatting with other guests, a feature we enjoyed at Ceylon Tea Trails.  But this is ultimately nitpicking; WCTL was truly a spectacular experience, and even though it is at (or over) the top of our price range, it felt like it was worth every penny.","A Truly Special Experience","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r987617964-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Do not be put off by the very unimpressive entrance off the main road. Once you reach the hotel everything is very well laid out and maintained.  Our villa Shakti (they do not have room numbers) had a reception area with very comfortable seats and a mini kitchen including a full sized fridge well stocked with drinks.  The main bedroom area was very spacious with a large sitting area leading onto a large patio with no fewer than ten different seats incluing two bean bags on the patio and two sun loungers in the garden area. The bathroom area was very large and well equipped.
During the whiole stay the housekeeping team maintained a very high standard of cleaning and the garderners and pool staff attended everyday.
We were on a half board package which we seemed best as we did not see any other restaurants nearby.  The food and service were excellent for the whole stay.

I arrived late evening when it was already dark and the interior of the hotel with the cozy lighting was astonishing. Aditiya is a wonderful place to relax with a beautiful sea view during the day and of course the elegantly designed and lit up common areas at night.
The meals are prepared to your own choice and you are free to dine at any time of the day, which is a unique feature at Aditya. If you like SriLankan food, my recommendation is go for it and you will not regret.
The bedrooms are large and comfortable with all amenities included. However, I believe the interior of the rooms needs to be upgraded to align with the common areas and the toilets redone. This would help to maintain the overall standard of the hotel in one level.","Relax in Total Silence beside the Sea","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d606377-r996465360-Aditya_Resort-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

We asked the chef to have a seafood feast on our last night and they delivered. 2 lobsters, 8 prawns and some crabs. You can dine in the main dining area, no airconditioning but lots of fans. Overall a great relaxing trip. Everything was clean, our rooms are cleaned everyday, water refilled. The men came around at night to refill any water bottles and the mini fridge/bar inside your room.

Mai bis zum 02. Juni 2025 besucht. Der Aufenthalt war fantastisch. Schon bei der Ankunft wurde man super freundlich willkommen geheißen. Es gab zur Begrüßung einen Blumenkranz und einen traditionellen Farbklecks auf die Stirn. 

Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels sind alle durchweg super freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wenn man morgens nur in Richtung Pool oder Strand ging kamen sofort die Mitarbeiter an und tragen einem seine Handtücher nach. Immer wieder wurde gefragt ob man irgendwas zu trinken oder Essen haben möchte. 

Die Zimmer waren geräumig und alles was man benötigte war vorhanden. Die Sauberkeit war sehr gut. Im Badezimmer wurde man des Öfteren von Geckos besucht 😉
Das Essen war super lecker, morgens wie auch die meisten Abende gab es Buffet mit großer Auswahl auch an einheimischen Essen. Der Schärfegrad war teilweise herausfordernd 😉

Der Strand war wunderschön und super sauber, genauso wie das Meer. Keinerlei Müll am Strand oder im Wasser, das war ein tolles Erlebnis. Für mich einer der schönsten Strände die ich bisher besucht habe. 

Zuletzt noch ein herzliches Dankeschön an ALLE Mitarbeiter diese hervorragenden Hotels. Hier kann man keinen herausnehmen, sondern alle waren einfach nur Klasse.

From the moment we arrived he had the kids smiling and from sun up to sun down they were entertained with creative arts, board games in the games rooms, themed adventures and outdoor play including cricket and volleyball. 
Every day the kids came back with huge smiles each day full of stories, smiles, and excitement. 

The activities were thoughtfully planned and age-appropriate, balancing creativity, learning, and fun perfectly and we loved that it included many local childhood games that Rutchira played as a child.  

His energy, smile, warmth and genuine care for the children was immediately apparent. He went above and beyond to create a safe, engaging, and joy-filled environment where every child felt special and included.

If you have children and are looking for somewhere to go as a family then I highly recommend recommend this resort as Rutchira will make you feel like family.

The rest of the staff were incredible also.  The rooms were cleaned each morning with great care and fresh water supplied at a call whenever we needed it.  A special mention also to Rupan who had laid out our towels each morning at the pool in our preferred location without even having to ask and he knew our names from day one.

Besonders möchte ich Ruchira hervorheben, der als Animateur einen tollen Job macht. Er bringt selbst unsere schüchterne Tochter mit anderen Kindern in Kontakt, lässt sich immer neue Spiele einfallen und ist dabei nicht aufdringlich. 

Das Hotel ist im Stil eines Fischerdorfs aufgebaut. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und stilvoll eingerichtet. Es gibt kostenlos Trinkwasser, das bei Bedarf nachgefüllt wird. 

Die Anlage ist komplett mit Sand aufgebaut. Neben dem großen Infinitypool gibt es einen kleineren im Schatten gelegenen. Außerdem lädt das warme Meer mit einem tollen sauberen Strand zum Baden ein. 

Wer möchte kann Wasseraktivitäten buchen. Haben wir allerdings nicht gemacht. 

Das Essenangebot ist vielfältig. Wir haben à la Card gegessen. Es gibt aber auch Buffet. 
Im Umkreis sind einige weniger Restaurants ebenfalls erreichbar. 

Erwähnen möchte ich auch das ayurvedische Spa-Angebot. Auch hier sind kompetente und freundliche Mitarbeiter tätig. Ich kann die Fußreflexzonen-Massage besonders empfehlen.

The introduction to the property was given by your staff (our comrade Rajendra Wattowita). This introduction & the package made us to select your property for our event.

Though this is a new property…
From the inception, it gave a different perspective.
The hotel security staff guided us correctly to our parking spots in an orderly manner & guided us correctly to the vast property.
Front Office: 
Staff were courtier and did the checking in /out fast. Guided us to our rooms. Good job.
House Keeping:
Staff were professional and attended to all our requirements. Good professional work.
F & B:
Staff was good & the spread was large,  but the taste of the food has to be improved… 
In the morning breakfast certain items in continental / English breakfast were not available in the spread. When inquired the answer given was not suited for a five star property (but later on the requested item was provided). Good attempt…
Hence professional cookery aspect has to be enhanced to suit the client’s tastes.

Thank you for sharing such a touching review. We are truly delighted that your experience with our Life Explorers Kids’ Club added so much joy and ease to your holiday.

Charundi and Ganga will be overjoyed to hear your kind words—it's clear their genuine care and warmth made a meaningful impression. Creating a safe, happy, and engaging space for our youngest guests (and peace of mind for their parents!) is at the heart of what we do.

We're deeply grateful for your appreciation and hope to welcome you and your little one back soon for more cherished memories at Cinnamon Life.

Thank you for taking the time to share your reflections on your visit to Cinnamon Life. We’re delighted that the interior décor, artistic displays, and thoughtfully designed spaces left such a strong impression on you.

Our goal has always been to create more than just a hotel—but a destination where architecture, design, and experience come together. We're especially pleased you enjoyed the ambience of the vertical garden and water wall, as well as the spectacular night views from the Dreams and Beats terrace.

We hope your next visit gives you even more time to explore and enjoy all that Cinnamon Life has to offer.

You might not realise this, but just as you do, we eagerly anticipate your every return - from your second visit to your next. I for one thank our lucky stars you came to stay in the first place and see the place as your home from home. You have supported us magnificently since that first visit and the truth is, the reason you feel you 'fit in' is because you do - perfectly, both of you. You have become special to us and other guests too, some, I’m sure expect you to be here whenever they are! You make the place extra special. Evenings are fun because you make them so, just as the restaurant has a sophisticated atmosphere whenever you dine in it.

We love the pair of you and can’t thank you enough for coming back every year and without fail, following up with a truly fabulous review. Thank you again for your exceptionally good custom (we don’t take it for granted) and for giving a special mention to unsung heroes who work here as well as me personally – I’m humbled. Above all, thanks for being spectacularly nice folk – they don’t come better than you two!

It sounds like a bit of a cliché, but this place really is a home from home.  The rooms are spacious, the beds large and comfortable, air conditioning excellent (and quiet), the gardens are quite extensive, well maintained and home to various interesting birds and animals all of whom seem to quire enjoy being photographed. The pool is also well maintained, the surrounding area is a wonderful place gather and make new friends. There is a swim-up bar in the shallows, and they are always happy to make cocktails to your specification as required.   The breakfast, lunch and evening meal menus offer a wide variety of cuisine styles, and, in the unlikely event, you don't see something you fancy, the chefs will happily cater for your needs. The hotel is located  within the Rekawa village, and if you take a late afternoon walk (when the day is a little cooler) you will be able to observe village life where people are often happy to chat and to direct you to points of interest. The hotel provides bicycles (free), so you can venture further afield if you wish. As a base for excursions, Marissa for whale watching is close by, as is the local turtle watch, Yala safari park is also easy to get to and Galle is great for sightseeing and shopping. The hotel manager, Kalpa, and his team will be happy to advise you and arrange for transport. The evenings are always fun at BP, the restaurant transforms, it has an enticing, sophisticated atmosphere where you can dress up or down, enjoy a quiet table for two or, as quite often happens, join with other guests to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.  Nick Buckingham (the owner) is always around to ensure that any celebration becomes an ‘occasion’ whether you are a first-time guest or a ‘returner’ like us.   Finally, a word about the staff, the service at this hotel is first class, every single member of the team at BP work hard to ensure guests have everything they need, and they always do so with the warmest smiles. And, if any maintenance issues do arise Chamadu and his housekeeping team work quietly and efficiently to address them.   By the way, there are also a couple of canine members of the team (Bella & Gracie), both are very used to meeting new people and will let you pat them - when they feel like it!   We have, of course, booked for next year.","Love this place","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r997115496-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Laying down some Chardonnay for next time…

Or was it, laying down with some Chardonnay?! 

Notwithstanding tempting bribes of other guests in the meantime, Madams name is scrawled across a couple of cases in the cool room for your next visit. Will you please convey my humble apologies for running out mid-stay? I fall on my sword for our faux pas, heads will continue to roll. Further, at Buckingham Place the customer is ALWAYS right - Mongooses it is, or they are, plus, if you really want to call Buckingham Place your ‘home’ I am delighted to concur. 

As ever, it was a pleasure to welcome you back. Time did fly, which hints perhaps at a much longer stay next time? Goodness knows how you’d fit a longer stay into your hectic non-stop-travel schedule, or how much Chardonnay we’d need to ship in, but we’ll happily do the needful to make it happen.
 
Thank you for coming back, and for yet another great review. A little less from the superlative factory this time but of equal eloquence and substance, and a perfect read to boot. I’m not sure if I told you this but for me your stays all morph into one. Like it or not, you have become part of this place now and we’re all as happy as can be with that too – indeed, long may the Chardonnay flow! 

Until next time and always, I wish you endless happy travels and a blissfully happy and healthy life.      

Heaped thanks!

It's always great to catch up with Nick, Kalpa and the team to learn what has changed and more importantly, what has not.
The weather was a bit changeable but it just didn't matter. All of the extensive array of wildlife that we enjoy seeing was in evidence. More mongooses (yes, it really is) around this year we thought and more peacocks too. The lemurs swung by, many with young, as they often do. 
On the domesticated front, Bella ensured that she got around to see the guests every day even accompanying some guests down to the beach in the mornings but Gracie has become reclusive.
A new welcome addition is Sanjaya who comes in to play the piano every few days in the evening. He can add a blues spin to anything and has his own natural and improvised style. 
When we needed to obtain some asthma medication unexpectedly, the staff swung into action. They quickly located a product with the correct active ingredients and obtained it from a pharmacy in the local town in double quick time.
We will undoubtedly be back at Buckingham Place in the near future. Long may the Chardonnay flow!","Home and Away","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r996814236-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Having read your review again, I’m as bowled over as I was the first time, by its depth, integrity and reassurance for those in your footsteps. I believe however, whether I would be bowled over or not was irrelevant, you use Trip Advisor as it was intended; not to be nice or mean to an establishment, but first and foremost to advise travelers as they do you, with their own submissions. We are extremely fortunate therefore, to be viewed so favorably by an expert, with nearly 900 reviews under your belt you should be taken seriously!

Reviews aside, although yours is spectacular – thank you, it is no more so than the two of you, whom we have come to know well, respect, and are privileged to call friends of Buckingham Place, ‘returners’ you call them or as I do, the lovely folk who come back.

Two more gentle, classy, old-school travelers are impossible to imagine. You stay long enough to absorb and be absorbed, finding something in which to participate or instigating something yourselves. You add your own magic, lots of it, being as warm, friendly and sociable as anyone who has ever arrived on our doorstep.

Your interest in the team touched all of us, you took time not only to learn staff names, but also about their lives and roles they play at the hotel. You engaged with them as you did me and other guests, with everyone enjoying your company and feeling at ease in your presence. 

I’ll leave it there for now but say this, any hotel would be improved with you two in residence; thank you for coming back to this one - please, keep on being those lovely folk who do! 
   
Big hugs and thanks,

Warm wishes from us all

The rooms are deliciously spacious all with nice views over the lake. Each room is nicely equipped with comfortable beds, good linen, a TV, little fridge with a few goodies to welcome you and wonderful bathrooms.  Early morning tea can be ordered to deliver to your room.    There are a mix of guests - with all ages loving this place. I think there is restriction on young children under 12.    It is a place to come and chill and truly relax, perhaps have a stroll on the beach, sit and watch the birds and occasional monkey, mongoose or lizard, but especially I adore the pool which is about 24 metres long and a place where people chill and relax.   The breakfasts are superb and there are lots of good snacks that can be ordered throughout the day and then a wonderful evening in the dining room is not to be missed.  The food is interesting and the team work hard to develop new dishes - but there are many great favourites as far as I am concerned.  The bar is a great place to meet before supper to meet other guests and have a good chat.  If you don't want to be sociable it is easy to relax too.

Your friends returned for a few more days as you know, and as I write, they are completely ‘with the program’ – the last ones down for breakfast bless them! 

I am so pleased your second stay measured up to your first, especially as you arrived with the friends you had kindly recommended the hotel to. I am also delighted that added an extra night to your stay, I only wish we could have offered you more availability in the first instance. 

I’m proud to say, we have welcomed so many familiar faces this season, in fact, not a day has passed without there being several former guests in residence – on some days occupying half the house or more. It’s great to now add your names to our long list of returnees, aka Friends of Buckingham Place, and I thank you on behalf of us all for your loyalty and for recommending us so highly. All of you together were a joy to host, it really was a pleasure to meet you again and welcome you back. With an abundance of ornithological and other experiences to be had, I hope you’ll keep on coming and that Sri Lanka keeps on giving. I can promise this, so long as you return soon, your wife won’t need an entirely new wardrobe - I don’t plan another repaint (just yet!).

Thank you for your good custom, smashing review (and photos), and your excellent company. Until next time and always have a blissfully happy and healthy life.

The breakfast is ""bottomless"" and the cuisine is very satisfying classy with a varying menu. All in US$ and definitely not overpriced.  
Relax and enjoy the lovely pool and the surrounds. The bar is small but with quality beer, wine and cocktails. 
This is the perfect base to visit the Lagoon Bird Sanctuary. Go early in the morning and enjoy the glorious sunrise. Right in front of the hotel you may time it right to watch turtles coming ashore to lay eggs on the beach.

I pinch myself even now, more than 14 years since reading our first perfect review. I didn’t imagine then and almost can’t believe it now, how frequently and highly the hotel, its team or myself personally are praised. Moreover, I am so touched to realize that Buckingham Place has found a place in so many hearts. Some have asked whether I tire of replying to guest reviews but always, my answer is the same, how can I? Reading a perfect review is a great way to start the day – any hotelier will tell you! Therefore, sending my thanks as I do herewith is as natural and rewarding as reading the kind words you’ve written. Reviews this good are tremendously important to a hotel and, especially for us, being as we are somewhat off the beaten track and an independent local business without the back-up of an international or Sri Lankan ‘brand’. 

I’m delighted because you enjoyed yourselves so much and we measured up well enough for you to consider coming back. We would be delighted to welcome you back as I you must realize. The moment you’re in need of a ‘fantastic relaxed atmosphere, extreme comfort, mouth-watering food and exquisite staff’ please, just get packing!

Thank you for your valuable good custom, perfect review and excellent company. On behalf of the team, I hope you will give us the pleasure of welcoming you back soon.

Our huge open plan room (12) overlooking the large lagoon, was beautifully appointed with a very comfy bed, inside/outside bathroom and polished cement ‘titanium’ flooring with ‘Happy Anniversary’ thoughtfully spelt out in tiny flowers on the floor.

Our first evening at dinner was a rather raucous affair as it was a fellow guest’s 60th birthday, complete with a lively performance from the house pianist and an impressive display of beautiful and dramatic Sri Lankan folk dancing topped off by fireworks.

Our meal the next evening was also lovely and the restaurant decorated our table with flowers, candles and a beautifully stitched, ‘ Happy Anniversary’ silk banner.  It was very touching indeed.

Nick, the very kind and interesting English owner, quietly floats around in the background meticulously ensuring that everything is just so. The hotel - with its funky, minimalist architecture, vibrant artwork and exceptional infinity pool -  is very much his baby and he has a wonderful Sri Lankan team to pamper each and every guest.

The kitchen is a delight and the wine list thoughtfully selected and reasonably priced.  The cocktails in the attractive, poolside bar are superb.  My wife deemed her Watermelon Martini the best she’s ever had and trust me, she’s had a few!

Finally, many thanks to the hardworking team, in no particular order; Sheehan, Ruwan, Aruna, Swee anee (excellent massage therapist), Maru and Madu.

Your review is a fitting and timely testament to a hardworking team, and whilst I thank you graciously for humbling me too, yours and every perfect review underline teamwork, secure and year-round, as the essential ingredient to the hotel's sustainability, as it enters its fifteenth year no less. As you know, many who work here joined during the construction phase, pre 2010 opening, and so long service is commonplace. For all 57 of them, I take this opportunity to thank you and every other kind guest for your empathy and immense respect towards those who served and cared for you during your stay; without its team the hotel is but a pile of bricks.

First and foremost Nick and his team go out of their way to ensure you have the best holiday ever, it’s relaxing and really friendly
The rooms are well equipped and spacious, the bed was really comfortable and waking up with spectacular views of the lagoon was truly breathtaking, it’s also the little details that make this place amazing, like the rechargeable torch  in your room to light you on your way back after dinner.
The staff at Buckingham Place was awesome, nothing was too much trouble, their attention to detail was incredible and they really made us feel at home.
The food was excellent, every meal felt gourmet. I’m a vegetarian and will admit to being a little bit fussy but every day we had different delicious choices which I loved, well done Chef and team 
The pool area is lovely, and swimming in the infinity pool stopping occasionally to take in the back drop is a little slice of paradise
The grounds are kept immaculately clean, the staff work really hard to keep everything looking amazing, we really enjoyed seeing the wildlife with monkeys, peacocks, mongoose, water monitor and the most fantastic birds, there’s even a book in the room to help you identify them

A dog that can speak is rare I agree, but a hotelier that barks is nothing new!

When guests return so many times, staying up to a month at a time, there’s an inevitability that friendship will blossom but also, that things will go wrong occasionally. How many times have we all experiences a disastrous overnight hotel stay or a dreadful meal or service? Therefore, despite 1,190 unbelievably fabulous Trip Advisor reviews (as of today), there are 12 that are not, suggesting things go wrong here too, occasionally, and we are only human.

So firstly, thank you in heaps for what is surely the mother of all reviews?  I can’t recall one written deeper from the heart. But moreover, thank you for your spectacularly loyal good custom, empathy and friendship, plus the sublime Belgian chocolates and forgiveness always for occasional (if inevitable) small disasters and us being human - and thus fallible, albeit rarely!
 
There are simply not enough words to express how highly we regard the pair of you. You are in the DNA of Buckingham Place through and through, and in our hearts and happy memories, always. 

Thank you.

So does the proverb go. Well a boutique hotel in Sri Lanka where one can sip Champagne with the owner, Mr. Nick, whilst listening to live music being played is even rarer. 

No wonder I returned for the 12th time to this little gem hidden near Rekawa (Tangalle) beach (where the giant turtles come to lay eggs) in the southern part of the island. 

It is a kind of heaven for those travellers looking for something extra. Your own private villa, a beautiful garden, 2 pools, no horrific music or tacky plastic chairs. No, here you get an army of professional staff catering for all your wishes. 

The villas are superb. You have your own balcony, a full complementary minibar, fully equipped bathroom, a safe, tv, huge bed, airco and VERY VERY CLEAN. Even so, if you want something extra they gave you a phone to call reception to bring an extra towel, water kettle, bottle of wine or whatever you can think of.   

One of the things I particularly like is the breakfast till late. You only woke up late morning? No problem at all. I’ll have that macchiato with a freshly squeezed (with a whatever you like) juice now please.  

There is a path next to the huge infinity pool that leads directly to the beach. Where,  with a bit of luck, you could see a huge mama turtle laying eggs or even sweeter a nest of mini turtles hatching from their eggs running towards the sea. 

Another prime bonus here is the professional spa. It is clean, has airco, a complete program of treatments and really good therapists. Discuss the treatment you want, choose the oil of your liking have the pressure adjusted… it is all ‘normal’ @ Buckingham Place. 

All day long you have an open kitchen, so whenever you are peckish call one of the waiters(yes they all speak English) or have their mixologist surprise you. 

Culinary highlight is the diner. Proceed for a pre diner cocktail in the bar or go direct to the table, oh the agony of choice. The kitchen is good and uses local ingredients. Fish is caught right in front of the hotel so any fresher is impossible as it will swim back to the sea it came from. Veggie choices are also available. 

There is a wine list available with wines ranging from 35-50 usd a bottle, wine by the glass is also possible. If you are not into alcohol a whole range of possibilities are also available. I strongly appreciate the availability of several sparkling waters. 

Mr Nick has been a hotelier for over a quarter of a century on this island, and runs his hotel like a Swiss clock. Thanks once again for a wonderful stay.","A dog that can speak is rare, Buckingham Place is even rarer","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r993725561-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

I'm overwhelmed by your very special review this morning and will share it with the team. Thank you very much for your kind support.

Every so often something touches my heart, and this is exactly what happened on the evening we helped the pair of you celebrate your anniversary. Your obvious, very genuine appreciation for everything the team did was in abundance, as was your kind respect for me that evening. You expressed this so sweetly at the time, making any effort we put in all the more worthwhile. Simply, it is so nice to give folk a treat that makes them smile all night, and, to know when they return home it will be with an enduring fond memory.  Often the simplest, most spontaneous ideas work best and are remembered.
 
It was our pleasure and privilege to host you, we'll remember you fondly and be delighted to welcome you back – soon hopefully, and for a longer please? For now, I take this opportunity to thank you for your valuable custom, this special review and your excellent laid-back company. I send my thanks and respect too for your civilized, commonsense view over a meal that may have upset you. We will never know and can’t rule it, so on behalf of us all I’m sorry if it did.

Until next time, I wish the both of you (and mum!) safe and happy travels and a blissfully happy life, always.

We were personally approached by the owner Nick (an English man) on many occasions who took a genuine interest in all his guests. The staff were 100% attentive, knew the guests by name and took the utmost care with everyone. On the evening of our anniversary the staff had hung a ‘happy  anniversary’ banner above our table, decorated it with flowers and gave us a handmade card signed by all the staff, a beautiful touch.
The rooms are, as Nick described, a sanctuary for his guests and they a very roomy, very comfortable and styled beautifully. The bathroom featured an open air shower and a covered tub area. We had a balcony where we could sit and look out over the lagoon.
We thoroughly enjoyed the live piano by Sanjaya a local musician and the atmosphere was relaxed. We truely felt like we were being looked after in the best way possible, everyone made us feel so comfortable and at home.

Where to start? 

A little potty perhaps, but I still hold my breath as I read a review. I then pinch myself if they are as perfect as yours, so thank you for making me pinch myself.

Before becoming a hotelier, I could never have imagined guests taking us into their hearts, supporting us with regular good custom, or heaping praise on us afterwards as you’ve done - again. As ever, rarely do I know what to say when good folk say nice things about me but I will try again. If you see me at my best, it is because the both of you bring it out in me - not only in me but in everybody. 

This may be your happy place, but you make it everybody else's too. You are huge fun to have around and have become part of the place, as much for your sense of humour as your fascination with wildlife - even our frogs are missing you!

I’m thrilled - we all are, that you still come to stay and enjoy yourselves so much, and, that your stays are getting longer. Thanks for assuring me that as the place evolves it changes for the better and still feels like home, and that you still find interesting critters to follow around the garden and something nice on the menu after four visits.

Thanks again for coming back, for being great sports, and for your loyal support for the fourth time. We hope you’ll keep on coming as others do and continue doing your bit to keep this place a happy space for all.

The food choices, quality and service were, as ever, excellent. The dinner menu has changed since our last visit, giving more options for those staying for longer than the 5 day menu rotation. We have our menu favourites  and to be able to choose these on multiple occasions made us happy. As always all food is fresh, well cooked and presented, having pre-dinner nibbles and drinks in the bar talking to other guests was nice. Both pools are immaculate, bed chairs and towels are clean and comfortable. The evening frog and toad journey through the pool, restaurant and bar kept me entertained. The rooms, we stayed in 2 due to availability, were cleaned daily, large and perfectly adequate, if you need anything just ask!
There are plenty of places to walk to see the wonderful wildlife that Sri Lanka has to offer, do ask Kalpa to arrange a visit to the Rekawa Turtle Sanctuary next door, or Kalamatiya bird sanctuary both are great value.

Thank you very much.

Many thanks for your wonderful review, I’m delighted you enjoyed a relaxing stay and felt good! From myself and on behalf of the team that does all the work, thank you for your sharing your observations and great compliments, it was a pleasure and privilege to host you, and to ensure you got the best from your stay. Thanks too for a timely swimming advisory, which, can never be given too many times. We include one on our website; the online booking platforms; and advise all travel agents that whilst our beach is one of the most spectacular on the south coast, its waves are not for swimming! Accessible sea and a good swim are never far away however, if Rekawa’s rock-pool (c15-minute walk) or our swimming pools don’t quite meet ones needs.

Your review is second to none, very helpful, and genuinely appreciated. Thank you for sharing your experience and so positively, and of course for your valuable good custom and excellent company.

Please come again, until then and always I wish you happy and safe travels, and a blissfully happy life.

I am very happy to say, Sri Lanka tourism has finally rebounded, and the hotel has remained in full swing since mid-December, thanks in very large part to fabulous recommendations like yours – thank you. Since early December and until the end of season, not a day will pass without us meeting folk we’ve hosted before. Many like you, rarely return anywhere, let alone to a destination far from home. But, many do, as I hope you will – if you are already thinking about it then you are halfway here!

Thank you for your respect and lovely compliments for the team, they will be chuffed to be recognized, when they eventually get a moment to catch up with reviews for the season. Your kind words for me too are humbling (I never know what to say but thank you) and I accept them graciously on behalf of those who pull out all the stops to make Buckingham Place a standout memory for all the right reasons – and a key reason to return to the Paradise Isle.         

Your good custom and fab review are genuinely respected and very much appreciated. Above all, however, thank you for your excellent company. It has been a pleasure and privilege to host and serve you.

Until next time (?) and always I wish you safe and happy travels and a blissfully happy life!

Our warmest regards,
Nick & the Team

The thing that stood out at this hotel was the amazing staff and atmosphere.  It wasn't your typical boutique hotel that concentrates on style alone.  It has a vibrant and welcoming feel and the service was first class.  The staff were friendly and Nick the owner made you feel part of the family as soon as you arrived.  If you wanted to be left to yourself that was not a problem either but if you needed anything it was not a problem and always done with a smile.

It was my birthday while I was there and my husband arranged a number of surprises on the day with the help of Kalpa that made the day all the more special.

The room (standard) was comfortable with a large bathroom including shower and bathtub and balcony.  The breakfast menu was extensive and included lighter options (such as fruit and toast) as well as good mains.  We also ate here in the evening and the menu varied daily and had a selection of meat, fish, veggie dishes.

We also had a massage while we were here (arranged as part of our trip) which was fantastic.

I am delighted you enjoyed your stay so much that you review the hotel so enthusiastically and aim to return - like so many do I'm proud to say. Your aim to return is obviously the ultimate compliment and so reassuring, as it is only the continuous kind patronage of local and overseas travelers that sustains 55 permanent jobs at Buckingham Place including mine, plus an estimated 200 livelihoods in this and surrounding communities. 

I take this opportunity to send warm regards to all our Australian friends, including those in the hotel as I write. We look forward to seeing you all back in Sri Lanka very soon.

With the fabulous festivities behind us, we settle into 2025, our 15th year. Your smashing review, the first this year, reminds me how blessed we are to still boast some of the best guest lists on the island; lists not of big celebrities but of bright stars; not of millionaire jet set types but more discerning ones, for whom, the value of sanctuary is greater than its price tag and opulence, and that contribute so much to the conviviality of a gathering of likeminded souls.

In short, Buckingham Place is for folk like you two; laid back, interesting and a joy to be with. I am so delighted you came, I and everyone you met enjoyed meeting you, and Christmas will be all the more memorable for your presence. So, thank you for coming, and for writing so eloquently about your time with us. Thank you for telling the world you can’t wait to return (that would do it for me) and for your respected, valuable good custom. Above all… thank you for your excellent company, it was a privilege and joy to host you.

Please return, the sooner the better is fine with us, in the meantime (and always) I wish you happy travels and a blissfully happy life.

Warm regards and respect - and a big hug from us all!

Rooms are spaced out in the gorgeous grounds, ensuring peace and quiet and privacy. They're well appointed, very spacious and beautifully clean. The bed was comfy and the open air bathroom was a cool feature.
Staff are quietly attentive, anticipating what you need, whether it be a foot stool for your feet, another drink, or a fresh towel for your poolside lounger.
We had breakfast provided as part of our deal - a lovely variety of choice, so we worked our way through the menu.
The dinner menu was of a high standard and changed nightly, with both Sri Lankan and European/fusion choices, so the food also become one of the highlights of our stay.
The pool is gorgeous, the swim up bar well tended and all in all, we couldn't fault our stay. Well worth the cost for a relaxing, pampered time.

Breakfast is a piece of art and delicious!!!!!","Perfect place to stay","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d11925680-r992357754-Kings_Pavilion-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",

Having travelled in many countries in Asia and generally the world, we always choose to stay (when there is one) in hotel chains like Aman Resorts, as we believe that the standards are guaranteed and we know what to expect. 
Ad a result, when arriving to Kings Pavillion we were a bit sceptical, but the moment we stepped in, our second thoughts were gone. The place is absolutely beautiful and very well taken care of, but the highlight was the staff and the personalised experience they provided that was even to the Aman standards. The food at the restaurant of the hotel is also a highlight.

Отель находится в красивом месте, павлины, бурундуки и обезьянки рядом.
Персонал старается сделать пребывание гостей максимально приятным. Бронировали напрямую через менеджера. Сначала увидела этот отель, потом захотела на Шри-ланку.
Были конец октября. Дождики непродолжительные имели место, океан мутный из-за волн.
 
Был номер с видом на море suite. Через 2 дня предложили переехать в king. Он больше, нам не принципиально, согласились из-за закрытой душевой. В suite душевая открыта и вода попадает на пол общего пространства комнаты, не очень удобно. На мой взгляд доплата за номер с видом на океан стоит этого.
 
 
Номер: мыло, шампунь, гель для душа, кондиционер. Разовые зубные щетки, бритвенный набор, лосьона для тела нет.
Тапочки резиновые (не новые).
Пляжные полотенца у бассейна можно взять.
Особенность отеля: много лестниц и крутой подъем к нему. Если есть сложности со здоровьем, имейте это ввиду. У супруга травма колена, тук-тук выручал, пешком было тяжеловато.  Несмотря на это, отель вспоминает с большим теплом, готов вернуться.
Пляжи рядом описаны ниже в отзывах. На ближайший ходили утром или вечером окунуться, а так уезжали на Turtle point в Диквелла. На Silent beach не смогла даже зайти, супруг купался, но он хорошо плавает.
По советам блали завтрак (8:00-10:00) + ужин (19:30-22:00).
Завтрак: фреши, фрукты, глазунья, омлет, каша, выпечка, кофе, чай, блинчики (с бананом), рис, курд, джем, сладости.
Ужин: рис, паста, салаты, фрукты, овощи печеные. Рыба, кальмары, краб, креветки выбираете из представленного, и вам приготовят. Помимо вышеперечисленного, из мясного  есть курица островатая. Все было свежее и вкусно.
Это 3-й отель на острове за это путешествие, понимаю, почему сюда возвращаются.
Экскурсии: мы приехали в этот отель уже после 2-х дневной экскурсии. Ниже много отзывов про гида Прасад. Нам не повезло, был не он лично, а ""брат"". Как гид он слабоват, только как сопровождающий. Он хуже говорит по-русски, дает минимум информации. К организации маршрута вопросов не было, все чётко: авто, водитель, маршрут по моим пожеланиям. Поэтому если будете пользоваться его услугами -уточняйте этот момент. 
 
С радостью вернемся в этот отель. Огромная благодарность всему персоналу.","Чудесное место и отель","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r980585374-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

The value for money was incredibly good. 
Mayavee resort is very well located, it's newly built on a small hill overlooking Unakuruwa, which is a beautiful beach. The views from this resort are stunning, as are the spectacular sunsets. The beach below is easily accessible by foot from the resort and it's not crowded. It offers good swimming and also has a good surf break. Surfboards are available for hire on the beach. There are at least two bars/ cafes on this beach.
Nearby are the famous Hiriketeya and Unawatuna beaches, all accessible via the readily-available and well-priced tuk-tuks.
Mayavee has two swimming pools and a restaurant with bar, which serves delicious and abundant food from both Sri Lankan and European menus. 
All the staff at Mayavee are very welcoming and hardworking. They are always eager and ready to help with whatever needs one may have. 
A particular mention goes to the resort's owner, Mr. Nurwan, whose hospitality is legendary. We were treated by him like royals! 
A special mention also to the manager of Mayavee, Mr. Asanka, who worked tirelessly to make our stay as luxurious as possible. 
The rooms were spacious, air-conditioned and luminous, the beds and pillows were super-comfortable, the modern and very clean bathrooms had all the necessary toiletries.
This has been one of the most relaxing and restful holidays in our family's history, and we do love to travel as a family.
We'll definitely be back again!","Truly, this is a Tropical Paradise","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r978465624-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Мы прилетали в Коломбо, по прилету после прохождения паспортного контроля и получения багажа (это не долго) вы проходите в большой вестибюль из которого уже выход на улицу и тут прямо по середине стоят несколько стеклянных будок, это обменник валюты обмен такой вы с одной стороны подаете паспорт валюту и становитесь в очередь с боку и потом вам там подают паспорт и их валюту- рупи, смотрите в основном все меняют доллары старые, новые без разницы, курс в аэропорту немного ниже чем в городе, но это копейки я был в сентябре 24-го, разница со 100 $ была 150 рублей, менять много смысла нет т.к. в последующем вы свободно поменяете их по мере необходимости (подробно напишу ниже) вообще с обменом не партесь !!!. И так поменяли сотку и проходим дальше там стоит будка с надписью на английском Диалог, тут продают СИМ карты, вот симку я купить советую т.к. в отеле вай-фай есть но немного поттупливает, да и всегда будете на связи и ориентироваться по картам где находитесь, я купил и звонил по видео через ватсап и кино смотрел короче удобно, симки есть на 30 Гб стоит 1700 рупи и 100 Гб стоит чет около 2000 рупи, (сумму в рупи делите на 3 и получаете рубли), при этом если летите через тур оператора то смотрите там уже бегают встречающие с табличками которые вас встречают. Так вас встретили (автобус с кондишкой и бутылочка воды ), привезли в отель, сам отель абалденный я об этом писать не буду до меня там уже все дифирамбы спеты. Едем далее в отеле в номере 4-е полотенца два больших и два маленьких, что то типа ""Раптор"" от комаров уже есть стоит в розетке, переходники в розетке на наши зарядки подходят, есть одноразовые зубные щетки, одноразовая бритва, три флакона толи с мылом толи с гелем для душа, все здорово. Если попросите то принесут халат и тапочки НО!! тапки будут простые шлепки чистые но не новые (я не знаю почему) . Так же есть чайник чай в пакетиках сахар, кофе и вода 4-е бутылки по 0.3 литра что ли, -это бесплатно есть холодильник в нем кола, спрайит это платно, воду пополняют каждый день , воды идет много т.к. климат жаркий и влажный. Пляжные полотенца тоже есть но они не в номере а там есть комната как идти в ресторан, короче увидите. После заселения мне предложили поменять номер на более крутой что ли но с доплатой, я отказался т.к. номер и так классный с балконом и видом на океан. Теперь про пляжи, первый у самого отеля называется Унакурува, (запомните! это так же название автобусной остановки у отеля) до него идти пару минут его видно из отеля там небольшие волны можно искупаться, там учат серфингу (как уж не знаю но занятие что то около 6000 рупи), да и туда тоже приплывают черепахи только немного подальше от берега мы лично что бы поплавать с черепахами ездили в Диквеллу (это город недалеко от отеля) . Второй пляж Сайлент до него идти минут 12-15 неспеша, это большой пляж очень красивый НО большие волны !!! купаться практически нельзя, будьте осторожны, я познакомился с ребятами с Урала парень в первый же день там сильно травмировал ногу, так же будьте осторожны с солнцем очень активное до экватора 600 км, у нас ребята Москвичи обгорели в первый же день было не комфортно, до этого пляжа для ленивых от отеля ездит тук-тук бесплатно по времени как вы закажете. Так, тут вроде разобрались. Теперь про Тангале, если надо туда съездить то можно от отеля на тук-туке он вас отвезет за алкашкой, в магазин еще куда надо и привезет обратно это что то 1200 рупи, но можно съездить самим это круче, я советую съездить сами на автобусе по времени автобус едет минут 10-15. И так, отель стоит недалеко от трассы которая идет вдоль побережья океана от Тангале до Галле и дальше, как я и сказал недалеко от отеля (3 минуты ходьбы) автобусная остановка название Унакурува, там садитесь на автобус (это отдельные впечатления ) билет стоит 50 рупи, и едете в сторону Тангале, первая остановка примерно через километра 1,5 это -Сайлент (да,да так же по названию пляжа про который я говорил), вот там есть магазин с одеждой и сувенирами но дорогой, но там есть ювелирная лавка где можно поменять валюту, да там еще есть небольшая будка с фруктами наши туда пешком ходили за кокосами. Ну ладно, приехали в Тангале на автовокзал он в центре (вообще городок небольшой и все расположено  вокруг центра ), там рядом с автовокзалом есть маленький магазин чая (я покупал как подарок знакомым ни чего особенного да и при выезде из отеля вам подарят большую пачку), магазин спиртного Вайнстори что ли, как то так, (из крепкого не плохой ром Калипсо 0,7  5500 рупи, да дороговато, вино красное с кенгуру на этикетке не плохое, пиво 0.5 470 рупи, говорят что рисовое но тоже среднечек пить можно ). Более в магазинах вы ни где алкоголя не найдете !!, ну что поделать буддисты. Но ! ребята советую сходить на овощной рынок, это да, впечатление незабываемое, мы там покупали манго нормальный ценник будет 600 рупи 1 кг., только пожалуйста не кушайте там ни чего на рынке !, почему вы поймете когда там побываете. Да если от автовокзала перейти дорогу и немного пройти там будет так же ювелирка где можно поменять валюту это без проблем, так же вокруг центра очень много бутиков с одеждой но это на любителя. Да ! Тангале как бы не курортный город и ценник там относительно нормальный !, в Гале ценник будет в 2 а то и в 3 раза выше. Ну вот в основном вроде и все, да чуть не забыл ! очень внимательно на дороге , движение левостороннее !! носятся как угорелые, правил практически нет. В завершение скажу что отель супер, Шри Ланка просто абалдеть, я думаю вам понравиться, если что  извините за ошибки и  колхозный стиль пытался донести попроще, как то так.","Для тех кто собирается ехать отдыхать в данный отель","2024-09","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r977013529-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Начитавшись отзывов о Шри-Ланке, отдыхать захотелось поехать только туда. Стали искать хороший отель по отзывам, случайно наткнулись на Mayavee Resort and Spa. Покупали тур на Травелате, сперва почитали отзывы там. Насторожило, что отзывы только хорошие, стали читать на других сайтах и удивились снова — только положительные. Были парочка на троечку, но это нас не напугало. Забронировали, выбрали самый простенький номер, не планировали много времени проводить в отеле. Также взяли завтраки и ужины, по советам из отзывов. Не пожалели ни разу.

Начну со встречи. Добирались мы долго, в соотношении время/стоимость выбрали вылет из Москвы с пересадкой в Эмиратах. В общей сложности дорога из Питера заняла около суток, 4,5 часа от аэропорта в отель, прибыли уже по темну. На ресепшене встретили с цветочными ожерельями, дали потрясающие полотенца с эвкалиптом, что с дороги было раем на земле. Зажгли свечи по местным традициям, тут же нас угостили арбузными фрэшами и предложили улучшенный номер за 25$ за ночь, но нам было не принципиально, потому отказались. 

Многие пишут про стройку — да, отель разрастается, но это никак нам не помешало. С самого заселения нас сопровождал потрясающий сервис. Все улыбчивые и приветливые, мы на английском говорим не очень, но с переводчиком никаких пробоем в общении не возникло.

Номера чистые и уютные, убираются каждый день, меняют полотенца, пополняют воду и чай/кофе, в мини-баре пиво и кола/спрайт по 2$ за бутылку, весьма приемлемо. Все необходимые мелочи в наличии (шампунь, кондиционер, гель для душа, щетки, бритвы, мыло). Переходники на наши адаптеры были, но лучше привезти с собой, они маленько искрят иногда. 

Вся территория чистая и аккуратная, персонал целый день работает как улей, ни к чему не придраться. 

Еда была хорошая, ничего супер-острого не было, ребята стараются делать разнообразные гарниры и салаты. Завтраки — яйца, блины, овощи, фрукты, сладости, фреши. Особенно шикарны фрукты — свежие и спелые, объедались целыми днями. На ужин креветки, тунец, кальмары, курица в разных вариациях, много гарниров и снова овощи, салаты и фрукты. Обедали тоже в отеле по аля-кард, по ценнику все равно что за пределами отеля, огромные порции и готовят хорошо. За отдельную плату на ужин можно взять свежую рыбку или крабов, но нам хватало и того, что подавали на шведском столе. 

Кофе не зашел лично мне, американо добить не смогла. Чай, хоть и супер-советовали, не попробовали (не знаю почему), но по отзывам — шик. 

До конца так и не смогли привыкнуть к тому, что за тобой везде принесут тарелочку, отодвинут стульчик — такая у них концепция, очень приятные все вокруг. 

Океан — три минуты пешком до небольшой бухты со спокойной водой, где можно просто поплавать, чуть правее серфят, прямо на этом пляже можно недорого поучиться стоять на доске. Тут же покупаешь в баре колу и пользуешься лежаками (самобытными и аскетичными, но шмотки бросить окей).

Пять минут ходьбы до пляжа Сайлент— красивый, с бушующим океаном и волнами, там пляж уже более оборудован, можно также купить напиток и пользоваться лежаками бесплатно. От отеля на этот пляж бесплатно возит тук-тук, но мы ходили пешком, не напряжно. Все местные здороваются и улыбаются.

Пишут про подъем в гору — да, но нужно понимать это, отель на возвышенности, нам труда не составляло. 

В общем и целом, отель — просто райский уголок, где тебя ежеминутно окружают хорошим сервисом, днём по крышам бегают обезьянки, прилетают павлины, на балкончик пробежит бурундук, а целыми днями приятно поют птички. Бассейн с видом на океан, который открыт круглосуточно. Недалеко от отеля есть пляж с черепахами, с ними можно поплавать, до города 10 минут на тук-туке за смешные деньги. 

Ездили на неделю, прилетели в мой день рождения, на ужине вынести тортик со свечами и поздравили всем персоналом, было очень приятно. На четвертый день переселили в улучшенный номер с балкончиком и видом на океан бесплатно, хотя нам было хорошо и в своем. Ещё один плюсик. 

В последний день нашего пребывания открылся второй бассейн, шикарный.

В отеле есть чайная лавка, ювелирная, ценник приемлемый, ниже, чем в тех, куда вас завезут с экскурсий. Об экскурсиях можно договориться с местными, которые возят вас на тук-туках. Также в отеле вам обменяют доллары на рупии по хорошему курсу, что тоже удобно. До достопримечательностей ехать далековато, но мы намеренно ехали на чилл и расслабон, если захотите потратить денёк на поездку, то без проблем посетите основные места, мы решили, что поедем в следующий раз и обязательно посмотрим, потому что посмотреть есть что. 

Огромная благородность всему персоналу, менеджеру Асанке за чудесный отдых. Надеемся вернуться снова, и желаем ребятам сохранить эту потрясную атмосферу и камерность.

По вечерам часто была живая музыка, а также каждый вечер интересовались, все ли у нас в порядке (Мужчина в белоснежных одеждах и шляпе)), в последний день подарили чаечек и деревянного слоника. 

Выбрав этот отель, вы точно не пожалеете ❤️

Великолепное обслуживание, персонал бегал как пчелки, даже когда в отеле было очень мало людей. Асанка (старший менеджер) всегда помогал в любых вопросах. Уборка номера ежедневная. Брали завтраки и ужины. Всем советую именно так и делать, так как вокруг не особо вкусно в заведениях и будет дороже. Вкуснее всего обедали на Сайлент бич (первое кафе) и кафе на пляже парадис. На индивидуальную экскурсию ездили с Прассадом ‪+94784700761‬ . Очень понравилось! Русскоязычный гид, забрал нас в 4 утра, через 2 часа были у водопада, затем 9-ти арочный мост, поезд, где получилось сделать обалденные фотки, малый пик Адама и чайные плантации. На обратном пути кормили обезьян, Прасад позаботился о печенье! В общем, рекомендуем отель и гида! Также рекомендую ехать в сезон, ближе к середине октября, так как мы попали в межсезонье, были небольшие дожди и беспокойный океан.","Отдых с конца сентября по начало октября","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r973173828-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Вы читаете эти строки, чтобы выбрать отель, а мы побывали здесь уже второй раз! Откровенно говоря, эгоистически думали, что мы первые, кто гостит второй раз. Но нет! Здесь уже были гости и по два, и по три(!) раза. Ну ничего, мы их обязательно догоним)))
Так как все пишут практически одно и тоже, что безусловно очень показательно, и не только пишут, но и оценивают(!) и так же как и мы в своём первом отзыве, то
постараемся выделить то, что может ускользать при первом знакомстве с отелем на второй план. 
Окружающее отель пространство достаточно типично для тропических стран - где-то неухоженность, мусор, выбоины на узких дорогах, соседство приличных вил и лачуг... но поворачивая на дорогу-коридор к Майави вы словно пересекаете невидимую границу и запредельный контраст неизменно ""поднимает"" вас в рай.
Тут даже строгий охранник будто ""апостол Пётр на вратах"", обязательно встаёт и приветствует вас белозубой улыбкой.
Тридцати часовой переход/переезд/перелёт до отеля то ещё испытание на прочность. Но когда на рецепции вас встречают словами ""вы дома, заказывайте чего хотите"", когда главный менеджер отеля лично берёт ваш багаж и препровождает вас в комнату, которая никакая и не комната, а наверно райская обитель с панорамным видом на океан... то не то что про перелёт забываешь, дар речи на мгновение теряешь...
Ресторан как и прежде на высоте. Можно ""захотеть"" чего нет на раздаче и сделают). Сейчас не сезон на мангустины и манго. Но желание гостя ""закон""))) и всё появилось. Можно пожелать дегустацию чая в ресторан и будет! А он, чай, реально хорош.
Рядом идёт строительство. Отель будет больше. Здесь, с увеличением потока гостей очень хотелось бы, чтобы отель не утерял свою камерность. Это действительно изюминка отеля. Руководство отеля это понимает. Посмотрим...
Открыто добавим, что строительство никак не портит отдых гостей. Положение на склоне горы и ярусы растительности великолепно сгасят шум. Специально прислушивались из номера к работе отбойного молотка - практически не слышно. После 6 вечера стройка замолкает совсем.
Любопытно, что строительством руководит хозяин отеля лично. Он видимо мастер на все руки. Здесь, как, наверное, везде на востоке начальник присутствует на производстве постоянно и смотрит за каждым работником. 
Кстати, имя хозяина Nuwan на нашем языке означает ""вперёд смотрящий"", ""видящий дальше других"".
В перспективе отель продлит свою территорию до берега Unakuruwa и обустроит пляж. Nuwan лично обещал)).
При первом посещении мы пожелали отелю раскрыть свой потенциал.
Время показало - это действительно происходит!","Ещё лучше","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r972104196-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Отдельно хочется сказать о персонале отеля. Ребята трудятся как пчелки 24/7, чтобы каждый гость чувствовал себя комфортно. Вы будете окружены заботой и вниманием с 1 дня пребывания. Причем это все не будет навязчивым. Каждый ваш день будет наполнен счастьем, благодарностью и улыбками окружающих вас людей.

Встретили бусами из цветов, церемонией зажжения свечей и приветственным кокосовым соком. Дали влажные полотенчики протереться с дороги - очень в тему, тк в мае климат тяжел:) и пот льет в три ручья:)) 
Номер. Номер у ТО бронировали самый простой. В отеле договорились за 10 суток в огромном номере с видом на океан и джунгли доплатить 300$. В номере большая кровать, тахта, 2 шкафа, тумбочки, тиви, минибар, стол, отличный кондей, чайник, чайные принадлежности, чай, кофе, сахар. Ванная комната - ванна, душевая кабина, 2 раковины, туалет. У ванной и душевой пол красиво оформлен камушками. Деревянная сушилка в стиль отеля. В ванной и раковинах в воде плавают приветственные цветы. Выход на балкон из ванной и из комнаты. На балконе тахта, 2 кресла и столик. Панорамный вид - выше всех похвал.
Бассейны. Панорамный - с прекрасным видом на лагуну, джунгли, в деревьях рядом можно наблюдать разнообразных птиц очень ярких окрасок, попугаев, тукана. В небе парят коршуны и орлы. По крыше гуляют павлины. На деревьях слева любят резвиться обезьяны (не мартышки!). Второй бассейн новый - он как бы в зарослях, длиннее и в темное время суток там зажигают свечи - фонари. Очень романтично. У каждого бассейна лежаки, зонты, полотенца. Глубина 150.
В отеле есть чайная и ювелирная лавка. Здесь цены лучше, чем в сувенирных лавках в местных городках и на чайных плантациях, а так же в ювелирке при шахте лунного камня. Купили серьги из гроздей лунных камней (в отеле 60$, в магазинчике где то в городке 120$, в ювелирке шахты 150. Да да, вот такая разница, сами в шоке. Чай отличного качества в отеле продается и зеленый и черный ( 3 вида) и золотой. НО! в конце отдыха вам подарит отель 2 упаковки этого чая:) и деревянного слоника. 
Еда. Охохохо. Мы потом неделю на морепродукты смотреть не могли, настолько ими объелись в отеле:)) Все свежайшее, наивкуснейшее, красиво подано. Конечно брать нужно питание завтрак и ужин. Две причины для этого : рядом с отелем практически ничего нет, а то что есть не внушает доверия. И вторая - зачем искать ужин в другом месте, если в отеле он прекрасен. В лотке со льдом выбираем морепродукты, при вас готовят. Салаты, брускеты, очень вкусный рис, лапша, овощи. Вкусные бисквиты, кексы, мармеладки, мороженное. На завтрак свежевыжатый сок нескольких видов. Чай, кофе. Омлет. Блинчик с бананом в меде и полит шоколадом. Бекон и сосиски. итп И всегда ты видишь улыбку от души, а не эти фальшивые турецко-египетские лебезения. Буддизм хорошая религия. Добрая. Очень в отеле персонал добрый, отзывчивый, душевный. Это важно. Очень важно. По русски не говорят, на английском или жестами. А вот меню можно было напечатать на русском (учитывая, что 75% отдыхающих русскоязычные). В ресторане хочу отметить Даноса - старается учить русские слова, чуть чуть говорит по русски и очень старается во всем помочь. Они все стараются. Как же там душевно!!! Асанка статный, интеллегентный, решает все вопросы. Мы были в не сезон, поэтому хозяина отеля не увидели, Асанка приехал на 3 день нашего отдыха и угостил нас шампанским (не бадяга газированная, а хорошее шампанское!). На прощальном ужине нас угостили лобстером и шампанским, я плакаль...Последние 2 дня мы оставались единственными гостями отеля - не сезон, небо затянуло, пошли дожди и усилились волны. Но это никак не отразилось на сервисе - номер убирали, в ресторане суетились только для нас 8 человек, лавка с чаем и ювелиркой работала. 
Так, что еще добавить - связь с ресепцией по ватсап, писать можно по русски, они и ответ пришлют на русском. Любой вопрос - решается. Например, на завтрак не можем прийти, тк экскурсия - соберут ланч бокс. Мы свой ланч бокс не нашли, так нам предложили обед в любой день. Нужен тук тук на пляж, рынок, маркет - вызывают, обмениваетесь телефоном с тук тукером и по ватсап общаетесь когда и куда вас отвезти, забрать. Мы здесь в отзывах нашли Рачал контакт ватсап и катались на нем - он рядом живет. Так же с ним брали экскурсию речное сафари. Его друг Томас хорошо говорит по русски - учился в России. Рекомендую. До пляжа Хирикати , потом забрать и проехать через маркет платили 4000рупи. Купались и на Диквеле, но там много камней, а так очень живописно, красивый песок, черепахи, цивильненько. Хирикати такой: коровки, собачки, хиппи, серфы. Но купаться идеально и природа красивая. Если плавать, то надо справой стороны. Волна вроде идет на тебя огромная, но вдруг раз и перед тобой расползлась. Волшебство какое то. А слева серфы волну ловят. Вообще каждый пляж разный, уникальный. Сайленд безумно красивый, но там не поплавать. Вот в гамачок с ромчиком и медетировать - никого народу вокруг! и такая райская красота! Пляж в ближайшей бухте, вот не знаю кому он нравится, мы там полчаса провели и все, больше не ходили. Хоть и нет там волн, какой то он не комфортный. И заход плохой. 
Зверушки - бурундуки тут везде, как у нас белки в парках. Обезьян 3 вида. Мартышки - это низшая каста. Белолицые уважаемы. И черные обезьяны- дважды видели, по одиночке они в основном. Одна черная к нам на балкон спустилась - и мы испугались и она нас. По крышам гуляют павлины, но не надо думать что постоянно - мы видели когда днем были в отеле. Так же и обезьяны резвятся на деревьях, их днем видели. Птичек очень много необычных, ярких, очень ярких. И орлы и коршуны парят красиво. Змей не видели. Скорпионов тоже.   
Варанов видели, но не в отеле. Один по Галле расхаживал как король по набережной. Второй дорогу переходил не торопясь, когда в аэропорт ехали. 
Алкоголь и сигареты дорогие. Сигареты очень крепкие. Алкоголь качественный.

Горшка в номере для ребенка не было, попросили, сказали часа через 2 будет, видимо специально ездили покупать горшок. Попросили для ребенка приготовить куриный бульон с лапшой, сказали без проблем сделаем, хотя в меню его не было. У нас были только завтраки, ужинали мы в отеле, 20 долларов с человека, за ребенка не брали, на ужин по шведскому столу выбираете гарнир, а там уже в открытом холодильнике лежит рыба, крабы, креветки, тунец, выбираете и готовят тут же и приносят! Едя вся вкусная, качественная! Каждый ужин живая музыка. Завтраки тоже отличные, блинчики, яичница, омлет, что захочешь, готовят при вас. Каша, рис, мучное, свежевыжатые соки, фрукты, мороженое. 
На заключительном ужине в подарок дали 2 бокала шампанского и сказали, что можем не оплачивать наш ужин.  В середине отдыха предложили переехать в номер выше категории без доплаты. Сотрудники отеля сделали все, что бы наш отдых пошлел на высшем уровне! 
Вид из номера это что то невероятное! 
При выезде из отеля дали нам подарки, слона и чаи! Так же организовали трансфер по адекватной цене. спасибо огромное всем сотрудникам отеля, мы такой сервис еще не встречали! Теперь нам будет сложно угодить. Желаем отелю процветания!","Великолепный отдых","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r949987085-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Шри Ланка – отеле MAYAVEE RESORT&SPA TANGALLE. 
Всегда стараемся путешествовать самостоятельно, без привлечения турфирм. И отель предоставляет возможность забронировать номер в нем самостоятельно. Такой способ бронирования организован не через сайт, но найти, как это сделать, в общем-то, можно. И так, отель бронировали через управляющего Асанку, коммуникации осуществляли через whatsapp (правда на английском языке, благо есть онлайн-переводчики), внесли частичную предоплату рублями на российскую карту партнеру отеля, оставшуюся же часть можно было внести наличными USD или картой. Правда с картой UnionPay от Россельхозбанка не задалось (на Шри Ланке где-то оплата по ней проходила, где-то нет).
Трансфер из аэропорта заказывали через отель, добираться от аэропорта Коломбо около 2,5-3 часов. На ресепшене радушно встретили с соком кокосов и фруктами.
Номер Deluxe Honeymoon Suite sea view просторный, в котором очень понравилось наличие деревянного пола в комнате, приятно ходить босиком, полотенце меняют каждый день, халаты по запросу, наличие веранды с шикарным видом на океан, в номере всегда была горячая вода. Wi-fi отлично работал, единственно не загружался Телеграмм. 
Проживание брали в формате ВВ (с завтраками), завтраки очень вкусные, блюда европейской и ланкийской кухни, всегда разнообразие свежевыжатых соков и фруктов, выбор чаев и кофе. Ужины организовываются в отеле в романтическом стиле при свечах с живой музыкой. На ужинах акцент на морепродукты (свежайшая рыба, креветки, стейк тунца, кальмары, крабы), очень вкусные супы, салаты и гарниры, на десерт пирожные, фрукты и мороженное. Ужины покупали уже в отеле, причем, посмотрев меню и цены в ближайших кафе, твердо решили ужинать здесь. Рекомендую сразу взять формат HB, это получится дешевле, чем покупать ужины дополнительно.
Персонал очень вежливый и любезный, всегда готов по возможности помочь. Для экономии времени на рутинные поездки по рынкам и магазинам, которые находятся в                 Тангалле по запросу за разумную плату отель организовывал покупку фруктов с доставкой в номер, фрукты все свежие и спелые. В отеле есть своя чайная лавка с различными премиальными чаями ручной работы, которые мы не встречали ни на чайных фабриках, ни в чайных магазинах острова.
В непосредственной близости от отеля находится пляж Surf Beach, к сожалению у отеля нет своих лежаков на пляже. Но на пляже есть пара кафе, располагающих лежаками, на которых можно расположиться, купив что-нибудь в баре. Минутах в 10 пешком, хотя можно воспользоваться и тук-туком отеля, находится пляж Silent Beach, пляж красивый с длинной береговой линией, но с очень сильными волнами.
Отель располагает к спокойному и размеренному отдыху, рядом нет шумных улиц, увеселительных заведений.
Особо хочется отметить владельца отеля мистера Нувана и управляющего по имени Асанка, которые прилагают максимум усилий, чтобы нахождение в отеле было комфортным и запоминающимся.","Райский уголок","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r946368853-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Бассейн с классным видом на океан 🌊 второй бассейн тоже готов к эксплуатации 🤩 отель маленький, нет большого количества людей, если хочется тишины и уединения- лучше места не найти! Рядом с отелем пляж Surf beach, там нет волн, можно всегда купаться, мы брали уроки серфинга там же, 25$ с человека за час занятия. Чуть подальше (10 минут пешком или 2 минуты на отельном тук-туке) пляж Silent beach, очень красивый, но с большими волнами, думаю с детьми там невозможно купаться. В другую сторону (10 минут) есть так же пляж Paradise, каждый пляж прекрасен по своему 💛 
Самое ценное, что есть в отеле Mayavee это его сотрудники, радушные, добрые люди, которые всегда спешат помочь. Хозяин отеля Мистер Нуван каждый вечер в отеле, интересуется как проходит отдых, подходит к каждому гостю, менеджер Асанка - всегда готов решить любые возникающие вопросы.

По приезду поинтересовались возможно ли поменять категорию номера. Доплата 10 долларов в сутки за номер. Показали на выбор пару номеров из которых мы выбрали 102а. Разместили всех довольно быстро, ждать не пришлось. Вид из номера на океан и практически тропический лес, отделяющий отель от океана. Номер большой, чистый, большая ванная комната (душевая, туалет, раковина, фен) с огромным окном, вид из которого хотя и ограничивает, не полностью не перекрывает близко растущее дерево. В номере чайные принадлежности, сейф (бесплатно). Пакетики с чаем и кофе пополняли каждый день. Убирали номер вполне хорошо, без претензий. Wi-Fi также в номере. Сервис: отель не большой, видимо поэтому персонал пытается найти подход к каждому гостю. Администратор (зовут Асанка) решал любые вопросы, вплоть до обмена долларов на местные рупии (кстати, курс у него хороший). Пару раз вырубался Wi-Fi. Персонал решал это проблему считанные минуты. Телевизор в номере включали лишь раз: каналов так и не нашли, можно под своей учеткой войти в нетфликс. Больше не включали. Что-нибудь смотрели на планшете - Wi-Fi тянет отлично. За сервис твердое 5! Месторасположение:. Отел расположен в пригороде Хамбантоты. Мы брали за 1200 рупий Тук-Тук, что бы поехать в город. В эту цену он нас возил на рынок+супермаркет+алкомаркет и обратно в отель. Отель расположен на холме - отсюда прекрасные виды на океан из номеров отела, бассейна и ресторана. Рядом с отелем 2 пляжа. Не большой пляж справа и большой (санлайт) слева. На правом пляже (мин 7 ходьбы) лучше купаться (по ходу движения из отеля) в его конце рядом с кафе Мунривер. Там меньше камней в море. Да и в Мунривер хорошо готовят, если Вы не берете обеды там и можно пообедать, что бы не возвращаться в отель. Также, при покупке напитков шезлонг занимаешь бесплатно (например, на черепашьем пляже 500 рупий за шезлонг). Слева (минут 15 ходьбы) большой красивый пляж, но из 12 дней нашего пребывания мы на него ходили раза 4, 3 из которых была большая волна. И о минусе отеля: он на холме, подъем на довольно крутой холм пешком. Молодежи это не по чем, но человеку в возрасте будет сложно каждый день взбираться на этот холм. Питание: Брали только завтраки в отеле. В округе есть несколько кафе. средний ценник 15-25 долларов за блюдо. Блюда преимущественно морепродукты, курица. Через пару дней докупили в отеле ужины 15 долларов с человека ужин. В отеле ужин, шведский стол: креветки, тунец, кальмары гриль - каждый день, овощные салаты, кари, еще какая-нибудь запеченная рыба, сладкий стол (не Турция, так что сладости своеобразные и ассортимент не большой). Из досуга по вечерам выступают местные музыканты, после их программы караоке для гостей. При выезде из отеля персонал подарил полукилограммовую пачку черного цейлонского чая. (Дома заваривали - оказался очень вкусным, а главное вкуснее, чем чай, который покупали на фабрике чая на экскурсии).

Бутиковый отель с индивидуальным подходом к каждому гостю, располагается в 200 метрах от тихого пляжа и скрыт от глаз в гуще тропических деревьев. На просторные балконы залетают павлины, по утрам поют птицы. Вас встречает дружелюбный, услужливый персонал и во время пребывания выполняют любые просьбы. Главный менеджер по имени Асанка, внимателен и обходителен, хорошо говорит по-английски и очень оперативно решает все вопросы. 
Номера новые (отель 2022 года), просторные, уборка качественная.  Гости отеля практически не пересекаются между собой, так как входы в номера располагаются с разных сторон здания ввиду неординарности постройки из-за расположения на склоне.Брали полный пансион, питание понравилось, особенно ужины (креветки, крабы, кальмары, свежая рыба). Ужины сопровождала живая музыка, было очень атмосферно и романтично. Каждый вечер на ужине присутствовал хозяин отеля и приветствовал каждого гостя. 
В зоне ресторана располагается бассейн с видом на океан и ближайшую бухту, где мы и купались. У бассейна лежаки, зонты и полотенца. Пляж тихий до обеда, после поднимается волна и вода становится немного грязной из-за листьев. На дне есть небольшие камни. Кроме этого пляжа, Советуем съездить на пляж с черепахами в диквеллу (6000 рупий туда и обратно, 20 мин в одну сторону). 
В отеле 24 номера. Строится еще 20 номеров и большой бассейн. Стройка совсем не мешает проживанию. 
Есть массажный кабинет, делают расслабляющий массаж, очень понравилось. 
До городка Тангалле 10 минут на тук туке, который быстро организуют на рецепции. 
Рейс лучше всего смотреть до аэропорта хамбантота и индивидуальный трансфер (45 минут до отеля). В здании аэропорта  есть бизнес зал (26 долларов), кормят вкусно.

Очень хорошие официанты, особенно хочется сказать спасибо менеджеру Сукуну, очень милый молодой человек. Вообще весь персонал очень, очень хороший. Рядом с отелем невероятный и самый красивый пляж на шри ланке-Сайлент Бич. Шри ланка поразительна, невероятная природа, чистый ,безумно красивый океан, очень добрые люди. Мы нашли супер классного водителя, который организовал нам решение всех вопросов, возил в магазины, поменять деньги, в рестораны,организовывал экскурсии . Рачал-+94715543567. Рекомендую экскурсию в национальный парк -Яла, наблюдать слонов в природе -это невероятно. Рядом с отелем есть еще один небольшой пляж на котором мы плавали с черепахами (справа). Природа острова захватывает, павлины прилетали к нам на балкон, бегал бурундук, по дороге в отель встретили мартышек.

This resort did not disappoint in any way.
A boutique hotel with facilities and layout that would shame many larger hotels.
The staff were all amazing, from reception, waiting and bar staff, and cleaners - everyone had a smile and took the time and effort to remember our likes, dislikes and routines.
Special mention must go to - in my opinion - the unsung and unseen heroes in the kitchen. The food was superb and beautifully presented.
Nothing many hotels can boast what is effectively its own beach with a subtle lifeguard on hand in case the surf misbehaved. We truly relaxed.
Nothing was too much trouble for anyone and we enjoyed a wonderful four days.

Our family just returned from what can only be described as the best hotel experience we’ve ever had! From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional hospitality. The staff, who made up about 70% of what made this stay so unforgettable, were absolutely incredible. They went above and beyond in every interaction, from the front desk to the housekeeping team. Everyone was not only professional but also genuinely kind, which made us feel like we were staying with family.

As for the hotel itself, it is truly wonderful. The facilities are top-notch, with clean, spacious rooms that were perfect for our family. The amenities were well-maintained and the overall atmosphere was so relaxing and inviting. The location was also perfect for exploring the area – close to everything we wanted to see, but peaceful enough to relax after a busy day.

The property itself is very beautifully organised with lovely pieces of vintage furniture dotted all over the place. The villa rooms (Aditi and Vaayu) are incredibly spacious and includes a kitchen area, bar island, mini sitting room, pool/jacuzzi, and equipped with almost everything you can think of - from all the necessary amenities and quite a few electronic gadgets as well (soundbar, portable speaker, TV). Probably the most spacious bathrooms in Sri Lanka!  The food was delicious and the chefs took a lot of care in preparing the varied cuisine dishes from an extensive menu.

Пассикуду выбрала по рекомендации знакомых - в апреле там нет волны. Отель выбрала по отзывам на сайте. Все правда. Отель замечательный. Очень компактный- на 40 номеров, номера большие, с верандой, ванная комната так вообще потрясение. Просто огромная. Все есть: халаты, тапочки, гель, крем, шампунь - на масляной основе, кожу не сушит. Номера убирали ежедневно, приходили еще вечером , узнать, нужно ли добавить воды, чая, кофе. Я брала завтраки и ужины. Этого достаточно. Кормили вкусно: ланкийская кухня и европейская. Мясо, рыба, фрукты, сладости, мороженое - ежедневно. Официанты работали отлично. 
Пляж песчаный, 50 метров от номера. Лежаков в избытке. Народу немного, очень комфортно. Аниматор ежедневно агитировал народ на волейбол, развлекал детей. Скучно не было. 
Массажистам из СПА- особая благодарность. Достойный массаж, ежедневно бесплатная йога, можно и масочки поделать, и паровую ванну принять и все это с маслами аюрведческими. 
Персонал очень доброжелательный, как будто я родственница, которую очень ждали в гости. 
В самой Пассикуде смотреть и брать нечего, но основные туристические локации рядом, часа на 2-3 пути ( по меркам Шри Ланки): Сигирия, Элла, Канди, 9-ти арочный мост.

As I did want to have a detour before we checked in to the hotel, we did travel more distance than travelling direct, which lead to us being on the road double the travel time. 

Reached the hotel on March 13, 2025 around 6 in the evening, and was greeted by a person from the hotel staff with a warm and friendly smile and was directed to the front office staff. The staff greeted us, and Chamara the front office manager was the first person to speak to us. He was friendly and was very helpful, in getting our checking in process done in a timely manner. One thing that was great was the cool towels given to freshen up, and the absolutely super passion fruit sorbet which was really a super pick me up for a person who has been on the road for 12 hours, and in hot weather condition. We were welcomed with a garland of flowers, and according to the Tamil traditions. 

The front office managers duties did not end at the point of checking in but he was the person who escorted us to our room, and showed where everything was within the room, so the we do not have to spend time thinking or looking. The room we stayed was super, spacious, and everything was clean and neat. We would also like to thank the hotel team for the lovely decorations done in our room wishing us for our anniversary. 

During our two day stay we had an awesome time, waling on the beach, the dip in the sea to the time spent in the pool, where the water was warm and nice (to be honest I didn’t want to come out of the pool in the evening).

The food at the buffet was super and a good spread of which I did enjoy the roasted pork with pineapple sauce, and the baked tune with garlic butter to name a few (however, whilst the spread of food was great, wish you guys had more seafood). On the second day, we were too full and did not go for the buffe but just ordered two portion of food that would go along with a beer to enjoy. The food which included a Devilled Pork (which was one of the best I have had), and a hot buttered cuttlefish (which I would not recommend as it was batter fried cuttlefish rather than what it is supposed to be). However, this did not mean that we were let down. 

One more great thing was the fact that Chamara the front office manager, and Janaka the F&B manger paid attention to each and every guest, and did speak to them on a daily basis to ensure that he guest were being taken care of, and to attention to any needs. 

A big thank you to both as well as the entire team at the hotel. Will never hesitate to recommend you guys… keep up the good work.","A Stay Worth Every Penny: Pure Bliss from Start to Finish","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1001419419-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",

Beim Eintreffen dieser wundervolle, offene Blick durch das Gebäude auf den tollen Pool bis hin zum Meer war wundervoll!
Unser Zimmer gefiel uns sehr, besonders das gemütliche King-Seize-Bett und unser Balkon mit herrlichem Ausblick zum Meer.
Im Bad besuchten uns abends die niedlichen Geckos.....wundervoll!!
Besonders hervorzuheben ist auch das sehr sehr gute Essen. Leckere Currys, viel Fisch und Meeresfrüchte. Für manche vielleicht zu scharf, aber wir mochten es sehr!
Wein war nicht all incl. und sehr teuer, tranken dafür aber die sehr leckeren Cocktails :-)

Animationen gab es keine, was wir auch nicht vermisst haben.
Im Maalu Maalu gibt es Ruhe, Zufriedenheit und Genuss in hohem Maß! Keinen Kampf um Liegestühle, Handtücher,Sonnenschirme..ect.
Der Strand war superschön und sehr sauber!
Das Spa haben wir oft in Anspruch genommen ,Massage am Strand einfach herrlich!
Wir sind der Meinung, dass man unbedingt eine Tuktuk-Fahrt machen muss. Ein tolles Erlebnis! 
Die Rezeption steht für alle Fragen rund um Aktivitäten sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit zur Verfügung!

Transfer zum Flughafen dauerte 6 Std., es war die Mühe aber definitiv wert!

Zu guter Letzt möchten wir uns sehr herzlichst beim ganzen Personal  und auch dem Management bedanken, die mit ihrer außergewöhnlichen zuvorkommenden und freundlichen Art den für uns bisher perfektesten Urlaub bereitet haben!

We were welcomed with a drink and check in was very quick. The common areas of the hotel are furnished in colonial style and the bedroom was very large and simply decorated and furnished. Huge comfortable bed and plenty of storage. There is good aircon in the bedroom but not in the bathroom which has open windows to the outside.  We slept very well.

I think the hot water is on solar so plenty of hot water for a shower in the evening, a bit less so in the morning. Towels could do with being replaced as seemed a little old.

The hotel only has 5/6 rooms and is on a 50 acre estate. The adjacent gardens are very well maintained and the estate is well worth a tour producing a lot of the fruit and vegetables that are used in the meals.

Staff are really helpful and very attentive at all times. As others have mentioned short tours of the area and the estate are conducted and well worth doing.

Food is excellent. Breakfasts are substantial and very good. We ate Siri Lankan dishes in the evening and it was some of the best food that we had in Sri Lanka.

Drinking a gin and tonic on our balcony watching the fruit bats as night fell is a memory that will not fade.

Thank you for your thoughtful and beautifully detailed review. We’re delighted to know that your experience at Cinnamon Life was both memorable and enjoyable.

It’s truly heartening to hear that our high-tech comforts and modern luxuries enhanced your stay, and that the warmth of our team left a lasting impression.

We also appreciate your constructive feedback regarding the check-in process. Your observation is well noted, and we will take steps to ensure our front office colleagues are more comprehensive in their welcome briefings moving forward.

It’s wonderful that you enjoyed our culinary offerings – especially the traditional Sri Lankan sweets. Our chefs were thrilled to receive your compliments.

Thank you once again for choosing Cinnamon Life. We look forward to welcoming you back for another exceptional stay in the heart of Colombo.

The hotel is equipped with very high-end technology and offers a modern, comfortable experience.

The staff were extremely friendly and always greeted us with warm, beautiful smiles. It truly made us feel welcome.
However, one small suggestion – the front office staff could improve a bit by providing more information during check-in, especially about the hotel facilities and in-room amenities.

The buffet was excellent, with a wide variety of tasty dishes. We especially enjoyed the Sri Lankan traditional sweets – compliments to the chefs!

We also tried in-room dining, and it was an outstanding experience. The person who answered the call was very professional, and the food was delivered promptly. The staff who brought the food was knowledgeable and polite.
Special thanks and high recommendations to Kushan and Sandun from the in-room dining team – great service!

Housekeeping also did a fantastic job. The room was always clean, fresh, and well-maintained. A big thank you to the housekeeping team for their great care.

Overall, I had a pleasant and memorable stay.

The service standard was excellent and impeccable.

The Walawwa property and the location are absolutely gorgeous and gives one the experience of a rainforest's calm in the surrounding atmosphere and a tranquillity you would never feel in the suburbs of any city. The staff are extremely polite and helpful and do absolute justice to the luxurious boutique experience you offer.

One among them stands out above the others, perhaps because he was serving us from our afternoon tea of the 23rd onwards. Whatever educational background he stems from he has mastered his spoken English so well that one would think he is fluent in same... And he (almost) is. It's not just his language skill but his attention to pander us with our order and requirements (and I am a nit-pick / detail-freak), and to double check details from the kitchen, etc were well noted and highly appreciated. 

Any negative detail -had there been any- could be easily overlooked with the overall ambience on offer. To indulge in Breakfast with a view of a large, idyllic lawn while hearing Edith Piaf sing La vien rose was perfect. Hearing this enchanting music at the poolside (ever so softly) was the icing on the cake. There was some awesome jazz (I’m sure I recognized Stefan Grappelly, Django Reinhardt, etc) all of which was a bonus.

We recommend this gorgeous property to any traveler / visitor looking for that blissful idyll away from the bustle of city life one. You will be ensconced in tropical enchantment whilst pampered in the lap of luxury.

La habitación fue simplemente extraordinaria: espaciosa, cómoda y con un aromas que me fascinó desde el primer instante. La cama muy cómodo. El baño, también amplio, era un verdadero oasis, y lo mejor de todo fueron los jabones, con olores refrescantes. 

Una mención especial merece el Z Spa. Probé el masaje, que es absolutamente imprescindible, salí como nueva. Además, participé en el programa Recharge, de bienestar, que incluyó sesiones de Vikasa Yoga, baños de sonido y Reiki. Recomiendo dedicar al menos tres días a este programa, es una experiencia revitalizante que vale la pena. 

La comida fue otro punto fuerte: deliciosa y presentada con mucho esmero. Aunque el servicio es pausado, esto contribuye a disfrutar cada momento de la experiencia gastronómica. El personal, siempre atento y servicial, se asegura de que cada detalle de la estancia sea agradable.

Our first night was in the Mountbatten suite, the latter two in the family room. Both rooms were immaculate, spacious and comfortable. The hotel has such a relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. The staff here are all so helpful and kind. 

The hospitality in the restaurant is first class. The dining is so flexible, the menu is varied with a good mix of western and Sri Lankan cuisine. We throughly enjoyed every breakfast lunch and dinner that we ate here. We’d like to give special thanks to Kapila, Rick and Lishanth in particular for taking such good care of us. Remembering us from our first night and asking how our tour had gone when we returned. We were so grateful to Rick for giving us a tour of the garden, definitely try to do this if you have chance during your stay. 

We were extremely grateful to have had a late checkout which allowed us to make the best of our last day in Sri Lanka, enjoying the pool and gardens here. Thank you so much!

We are already planning our return to Sri Lanka next summer, of course beginning and ending our journey here at the wonderful Wallawaa.

This is our second visit to wonderful Wallawwa. 
We have recommended this property to countless family and friends over the years. 
Regardless if your arriving at Colombo airport Sri Lanka, or on your way home, don't miss a stay at this boutique hotel which is only 20 min from the airport.
We stayed two nights this trip so we could do a day trip to Colombo and really enjoy the property.
Our first visit 8 years ago was purley transit so we only stayed for one night as a family. We did not want to make that mistake again, one night is not enough. 
This trip was in conjunction with our daughters destination wedding so Wallawwa had many of the extended and immediate family staying at various times. 
All family members who stayed at Wallawwa could not believe how special it is. 
As with all the Teardrop Hotels, Social Hour is a great time to enjoy an evening GnT in the beautiful pavillions or garden. Wallawwa boasts an impressive bar with 5 star service. 
We especially love the relaxing pool area.

Best place we have stayed in Sri Lanka. Stayed for 2 nights. Wish I could have stayed for a week. 

Service is impeccable. Its currently a smaller place (due to expand) so you feel
so well known and cared for. They anticipate your needs and delver with joy. 

Rooms (villas) are amazing. So spacious. Beds are comfortable. Minibar is free- yes, you read right. Super safe (gated). The walk down from your villa is beautiful. And who doesn’t want to wake up to monkeys crossing your roof in the morning. 

Food is a standout. Please try their pastries- could have eaten them al day. Curries are divine. Breakfast is substantial (remember the pastries!). We tried to eat the whole menu. They have their own herb, vege and fruit garden on site so you know it’s fresh! Definitely eat in and give the food a go. 

Activities are plentiful. We had a ball trying out the air rifling and archery. Billards and table tennis. The pool
and spa. We didn’t use the gym - climbing up Sigiriya was enough exercise.

Location was fabulous- easy to get to the main sites and they can assist with transport if you need.  We also used their laundry service - done perfectly and in time. 

Traveled with family in a group of seven. Two week tour of Sri Lanka mainly staying at 5 star properties. This is a standout.","Perfect stay.

I am so pleased to have had an opportunity to thank you in person for this perfect review. Nothing I could write here could possibly express how much we all appreciate your gracious support, valuable custom and fine company. 

Over the years, I have become less frustrated by my inability to speak a language other than English. I have learned, the spoken word is only part of the story, conversation is about so much more. Actions, expressions and body language are generally enough to tell me and most people about someone – and I have become an expert! So, despite not sharing a common language it was easy to determine we were hosting two genuine, gentle, delightful, highly appreciative guests, both of whom with an empathy and immense respect for my team. Without language we figured out what you needed and how to get along nicely, and our week with you here was a happy one as it was for you. So, I thank you for choosing Buckingham Place, for bringing good custom to us and, supporting us magnificently with a ‘big thumbs up’ review. It was a pleasure and our privilege to host you both so it could go without saying, we would be happy and proud to serve you again. I am so pleased the hotel gave you what it gives me each day; the calm serenity of nature, the honest warmth of a welcome, and people who genuinely care. 

Thank you on behalf of us all, please do come back, in the meantime I wish you both a healthy, safe and blissfully happy life! 

Warm wishes & respect,

Наслаждение природой, прекрасно продуманной посадкой растений и цветов на территории, где вы можете наблюдать множество птиц, пальмовых белок, милейших обезьян, попугаев, павлинов, варанов, белок, бабочек, а также на пляже огромных черепах и их малышей. Номер просторный, роскошная ванная комната с тропическим душем под открытым небом. Чай и кофе на террасе с потрясающим видом на лагуну, панорамный ресторан с вкуснейшей кухней и видом на океан, чистейший инфинити-бассейн - все это великолепно организовано Ником Букингем, именем которого назван отель и который делает все, чтобы ваш отдых был незабываемым, все продумано до мельчайших деталей с любовью! Команда отеля- высокопрофессиональные люди, от чуткого внимания которых ничего не ускользнет. Чистота везде и во всем! Территория ухоженная, ни один листик не останется без внимания, идеальный газон, свежее белье и полотенца! Я -люблю путешествовать и для меня ленивый отдых неприемлем, но это место заставляет расслабиться и забыть все проблемы и отвлечься от суеты! Завтрак лично для вас приготовят в любое время дня, ужин ежедневно абсолютно разный, в течение дня предлагают вкуснейшие коктейли и воду.
Всегда с заботой вас ждут с пляжа со стаканом ледяной воды. Кстати, калитка на пляж закрывается в 18:00, но это не проблема, можно пройти через проход, где находится экскурсионное агентство .
 Дизайн отеля - это отдельный вид искусства! Яркая палитра, фантастические картины, атмосфера уюта, умиротворенная музыка, живые цветы, свечи -  создают  незабываемое чувство радости и тепла! Слово депрессия здесь будет искоренено!
Магазинов рядом нет, есть множество кафешек, но желания в них есть нет, кухня отеля настолько изысканная!

I never cease to be amazed by the sheer enthusiasm of our guests, and their heartfelt appreciation for what do - which is simply to encourage everyone to relax, enjoy a self-indulgent few days, and to not feel guilty about it! 

Your review truly is heartwarming - thank you; you compliment everything I also like about being here; a friendly and helpful team, the hotels calm ambience, abundant wildlife and verdant gardens – and not forgetting the dogs, but you praise me mercilessly too! To be truthful it is a loyal committed team of 55 that does all the hard work and deserves the accolades, but I accept graciously and thank you on behalf of them all. 

I try not to forget how fortunate I am to live here year-round and promise readers of my reply, one rarely tires of being here, not even after 22 years. So go ahead, book a long stay with confidence, and reach a level of relaxation we rarely treat ourselves to.        

Thanks again for bringing your valuable custom and good selves to Buckingham Place, and for your kind words of support which I’m thrilled to see on an online booking website this morning - twice as helpful. Your support comes at a critical time of year, the commencement of our winter season. Thank you, you reassure us we are ready, while instilling confidence in those in your footsteps to come. 

You were delightful guest, so we would be over the moon to welcome you again, preferably for longer as you say! In the meantime and for always I wish you a healthy, peaceful and blissfully happy life!

Sincere thanks for your patronage and kind support.

Warm regards & respect,
Nick & the Team

It's such a peaceful place with amazing staff and an extraordinary owner who really looks after his guests and ensures the best quality in all areas: Our room, the tree house (honeymoon suite), was very spacious, super clean, with a good bed, a comfortable sofa and views of the lagoon. The open-plan bathroom is wonderful, with a palm tree towering into the sky in the centre. Bathroom amenities smell so good and are provided in ceramic bottles. No plastic in the whole hotel! This is how it should be 👍🏼 From the balcony, you can watch the peacock dance and countless birds. The birdsong is the only thing you can hear here. If you are looking for absolute peace and relaxation in a perfectly manicured tropical garden, this is the place for you. There are two pools, we had the smaller garden pool all to ourselves - only an iguana kept us company. An attentive member of staff even brought us a delicious fruit juice. 
In general, the hotel offers a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️star service. The guest is really looked after here, always with the utmost discretion. Many thanks to the whole team! The food in the Oceanfront Restaurant is excellent, you eat in stylish & colourful surroundings, quiet and private. Room service and fresh coffee in the early morning are free of charge. 
Everything is just right here, the attention to detail makes all the difference. Nick, the owner, runs the hotel with passion and skill. Never before have we experienced such a committed hotelier - and we travel very often. He has an exceptional personality and is a pleasure to talk to. The whole team is top professional and always with a warm smile. Special thanks also to Kalpa for being such a friendly, reachable and reliable manager! We also immediately took Bella the dog to our hearts, she accompanied us on the wonderfully wild and deserted beach. Thanks to Nick and his team for two unforgettable days.

Thank you for staying with us, and, for your wonderful compliments and kind congratulations. You reward us all, noticing the details (many are ideas from our guests) and expressing gratitude for the dedication of my Team. I do wish I was multilingual however, so I might converse fully with everybody I meet - this very much came to mind when we met. A guest said recently “smiles on our faces is all the communication you need”. So, I will judge by your smiles and this perfect review, that the hotel speaks in other languages including Spanish, and is as welcoming of all nationalities as rightly it should be!  

I am delighted you were satisfied with the hotel and all of us. Thank you for telling fellow travelers of Spain, and indeed all travelers of the World! Finally, Thank you for your valuable custom and delightfully kind words, we much appreciate both.

Please come again, in the meantime I send Seasons Greeting and wish you both, a blissfully happy life.

Thank you for making us smile (again) with your second fabulous review, another in a long series, I hope?

Having been well and truly through the mill over recent years, you arrived at Buckingham Place more than ready for a holiday. In fact, I swear had we allocated a broom cupboard you’d have been happy with it, just to have the past behind you and two blissful weeks ahead – which they certainly were for us.

Those of us in the house from your previous stay looked forward to welcoming you back, and any new members soon discovered for themselves that to host and serve you is a joy and a privilege. Always ready to share some lighthearted banter or engage fully, you make everyone around you feel at ease and genuinely appreciated. Then there’s the generosity, and your enthusiasm to help out. I can’t thank you enough for answering my prayers with the sherry, but as if that wasn’t enough, many thanks for arriving laden with Christmas goodies to surprise us. I absolutely promise not to share them!! Simply, you are non-stop lovely to us all day long, even before the airport check-in counter and after your hols, by going to considerable lengths to write a comprehensive review to support us and help fellow travelers. Everyone one you’ve made mention of by the way, is chuffed to bits!

Thank you again for your valuable custom, two fabulous reviews (so far), two weeks of excellent company, and, for being such thoughtful heroes. We thoroughly enjoyed your stay and look forward to the next, the question is, have YOU packed yet? 

With fond regards, respect and great big hugs!

When we left in 2019 we already knew we wanted to return. This is unusual as we generally take the view that there are so many places to visit all around the world. Also, in instances where we do thoroughly enjoy ourselves there is a concern whether a second visit would be as enchanting and do we risk spoiling the first visit memories. Fast forward 5 years, through a pandemic, retirement, losing family members and life in general and we were ready and able to return.
On arrival to this 5 acre site, you are immediately greeted by genuine, warm, friendly smiling staff whose sole aim is to ensure you have the best possible stay. The sense of tranquillity is immediate, and we were taken straight to our large accommodation comprising open plan bedroom and seating area, with separate room containing a wardrobe, safe, storage area for luggage and fridge (stocked daily with water, ginger beer, complimentary nuts and sweets). There is also a huge bathroom area with sink, w.c., bidet, sunken bath and separate shower, the latter two being open air so you can bathe or shower and look at the stars.  Many of the rooms enjoy the benefit of views across Rekawa Lagoon.
Although the entire property has been repainted and refurbished since our last visit, many things remain the same. The staff are still attentive and keen to look after you. The restaurant still produces a wide range of breakfasts, which can still also be enjoyed in a location of your choice and at a time that suits you. There are also snacks available during the day and evening menus catering to vegetarian, local and European tastes. The menu changes over the course of a few days. Additionally you can request a starter be made into a main course. We were fortunate to be staying 14 nights on this occasion and found no difficulty in choosing interesting dishes each day, all of which were freshly cooked and delicious.
As you will gather from reading a number of reviews of BP, this is a place to relax, unwind and allow others to take care of you. The owner, Mr Nick Buckingham has created a well thought out, serene , boutique hotel, ably and willingly supported by a team of between 50 and 60 staff. Nick fell in love with Sri Lanka and made it his home. His staff and their families reliant upon the success of BP.  We intend to continue our support as we are already planning the next visit.
Our gratitude and best wishes to Nick, Kalpa, Chamindu, Madu (day 6 when we arrived), Deepal (No.1 Commander), Ruan (No.2 Commander), Assan, Arsan, Aruna, Niluka, Madu, Sharnika (accounts), Vajiray and Srianne at the Spa.  We apologise to the Garden, Housekeeping and Restaurant Teams, some of  whom we met but whose names we do not know.  Collectively, you have succeeded in delivering a truly memorable holiday that felt like a loving, warm embrace.
We are off now to start packing for our return.  Ayubowan.","Have You Packed Yet?","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r983049618-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

After reading your spectacular reviews (with great pics) this morning, our day can’t possibly get better. Thank you, your kind words are pinging around the hotel as I reply.

A more enthusiastic or empathetic couple I struggle to recall - you are remembered fondly for being so. When we first met, I did wonder whether our slow pace would suit you but clearly, I needn’t have worried at all. The sanctuary of Buckingham Place was just what you needed. As for me, I was in my element having cool, interesting folk to natter with. I appreciated your interest in the hotel and its back stories as much as your genuine kindness towards us all. For the team, every member who met you, your warmth and admiration for them all were in abundance, simply you made everybody's day. Some travelers overlook or worse, lack patience for hotel staff who work their socks off adapting to our culture and language, invariably as they indulge our peculiar whims! Not so you, far from it, taking time to ‘shoot the breeze’ with everyone regardless of status, genuinely, with empathy and respect, touched us all.

Your unequivocal thumbs up for what we do warms our hearts and makes us smile, and your good custom is highly prized. That you chose our hotel for a week of your honeymoon was a pleasure and privilege for us, but that you made time for us all makes you truly memorable, so I thank you for this above all else.

Please return someday soon, in the meantime and always, I wish you happy travels and a blissfully happy life together.

With respect and affection

Nick, Kalpa, Chamindu, Madu and the entire team.

Never been much of a beach dweller but Buckingham place allows you to truly switch off. Waking up to the lagoon and lying on the Indian Ocean through the day. The place is a menagerie with peacocks, monkeys and mongooses trotting around the property - amazing to watch their routine from the terraces. 

The team led by Madu, Kalpa and Chamindu couldn’t do enough for you, whilst not being overbearing but preempting your every need with minimal fuss. Just heaven. 

The owner Nick and his lovely dogs Bella and Gracie gave the place a homely feel and their love of Sri Lanka was infectious.

Perfect guests, perfect review...

The team and I were thrilled to read your perfect review this morning. On behalf of us all, thank you for your kind praise and for taking time to bring smiles to our faces! 

Every single review helps. We deeply appreciate yours, along with all of the incredible support we’ve been blessed with since 2010. Recent and unqualified recommendation however, from an experienced traveler, can help that little bit more. Reinforcing what others say will reassure fellow travelers making plans for the upcoming winter season, and underlining our website swimming advisory helps keep everyone safe! On this, throughout the year we suggest safer beaches for swimming nearby, although none are quite as empty or quite as beautiful as Rekawa’s, nor prime nesting grounds for 5 species of sea turtle. 

I’m delighted you enjoyed your stay (as did we all) and add personal thanks for being such sociable guests. Thank you for your valuable custom, a perfect review and your excellent company - I hope we have the privilege to welcome you back one day but until then and always, I wish you happy travels and a blissfully happy life.

REVIEW MASTERCLASS – SINCERE THANKS

Thank you for coming to stay, and for your eloquent, resounding thumbs up for us all as well and the hotel itself. Your review could not be better or better timed to be frank, with winter season almost upon us. All praise, even constructive criticism is welcome and greatly appreciated, however, your masterclass review could not be more so nor make us happier!

To have created a place that in its fifteenth year is still on point and making people smile has become the pinnacle of my working life (so far), but I’m not finished yet, not by a long way. To their credit, it’s actually the team that does all the hard work at Buckingham Place. So, whilst I graciously accept your fabulous praise I do so humbled, and on behalf of them all.

I believe you discovered, spending just a couple of days with us can leave some folk wishing they’d booked for longer. We’re lucky to host every traveler we meet and for however long, but I do hope next time sees you kick of your shoes for a lot longer, if for no other reason than to swap more stories! It was a pleasure meeting you both and our privilege to host you. Thank you for your valuable good custom, sublime, masterclass review and excellent company. 

Until we meet again and for always, I wish you happy travels and a blissfully happy life,

We’ve been called worse but add, by none better; if ever we’ve hosted a couple whose stay was too short you win hands down.

In a world of beige, mainstream mundane, daring to be different is a little risky I admit, a tad bonkers even - but then again, is it? So long as we continue being blessed by great guest lists, fill the house each season, and still enjoy what we do after 14 years, why sell-out?

Heaped thanks, for your valuable custom, this bonkers (but fab) review and for choosing us, we could not have wished for better company albeit it too brief.

Unexpected moments often remind me of my good fortune and privileged life as an hotelier. One privalege, loafing around in the bar with a glass of wine in my hand, swapping stories with the interesting folk that I meet, came to the fore spending time with you both. We are kindred spirits in many ways I think, so thank you for sharing your time, you are a joy to host. 

Your eloquent praise on this forum and in person is heartwarming, humbling and second to none and I sincerely thank you for it. But, it is your superb company and old school good manners (a rarity these days) that I shall remember always. Needless to say, you will always be welcome at 'Oceanfront @ Buckingham Place' (cheeky, but please feel free to copy your fab review to our restaurant listing!) and I shall look forward to your return.

By no means their spokesperson, I thank and toast you both on behalf of Rekwa’s nesting sea turtles and human community. Whilst many in the community are yet to fully appreciate your conservation initiative and, your effort I know seems akin to having teeth pulled, progress does come with each visit, slowly but surely, visible or not.

It was an unforgettable experience in the most breathtaking surroundings. It was apparent as soon as we arrived that a great deal of thought and love has gone in to creating such a magical place. From the luscious tropical gardens to the glorious design and decor of the dining and bar area it managed to feel exclusive yet extremely welcoming. It is the kind of setting where I imagine Bond and Hemingway would happily settle. We started the evening with superb cocktails in the bar/lounge area to a soundtrack of the Indian Ocean and some magnificent jazz. Unobtrusive yet wonderfully atmospheric. We then moved to the airy dining room which looks out onto one of the pools surrounded by palms and the white sands below. I ordered the sesame crusted tuna salad with fresh mango and a miso/wasabi dip which was one of those dishes I will forever try to recreate but will never come close to succeeding. It was exquisite and I would return to Sri Lanka for that alone. The service was also superb. The staff were attentive but not overly so. They seemed to appear when we needed something but were not watching our every move. I can not recommend Buckingham Place highly enough. I plan on returning there as soon as I can.

Thank you for coming to stay, and then taking time to post a truly helpful stand-out review. We are proud to read it this morning and I am reminded personally, how fortunate we are to still boast the best guest list on the island in our 14th year.

Many one night stay guests have become regulars over the years and folk we see as friends. Most tell me they rarely or never return to a hotel only ours, so I hope you will as they have, and you’ve found a sanctuary that remains in your hearts always. 

Thank you for your valued custom and good company, moreover, thank you for your respect and kind empathy for us all. Until next time and always I wish you happy travels and, a blissfully happy life!

Thank you, for coming to stay and then following up with a helpful review, one both complimentary and objective as one expects from seasoned travelers. I’m delighted by your positive comments and will try addressing your observations by means of explanation.
 
First, especially through rainy seasons, Sri Lanka’s fascinating (to me) bio diversity can occasionally come too close, irrespective of the lengths those of us with open air facilities go to in order to sanitize and prevent it. Even during hot dry periods in the tropics, wildlife can present challenges to guests and hoteliers alike; often we can fear the unknown in my experience. To give you perspective and reassure others, I have lived on the property for 22 years and to my knowledge, nobody has experienced more than minor insect stings and thankfully mosquitoes are rare due to regular fogging and frequent inspection of gutters, gullies, rooftops and drains.
      
Boarding options. I agree with you, B&B is (generally) best option, unless one normally eats heartily three times daily or prefers travel with a fixed meals budget. Extensive breakfast and lunch menus are complimented by five short varied menus rotating over five nights, with bespoke cooking an option at every meal time. We encourage guests to take advantage of a late breakfast and all day dining and often, due to this and generous portions, some find two meals more than adequate. As all meals are al a carte and prepped/cooked freshly to order from scratch, timing can be an issue I agree, but most dishes can be ordered and eaten within an hour except for some of our local options. I’m sorry you missed desert so as not to miss a turtle, during peak nesting months (Feb-Jul) turtles are more plentiful and thus, one need not let one get in the way of desert! I have made note to provide more clarity on this in future so thank you for raising it.

Thank you for taking time to share your experience here on Trip Advisor. I hope overall you felt comfortable, safe and and at home with us, and have returned home with fond memories of your stay. Finally, thank you for your valuable custom, kind feedback and fine company, please come again soon - hopefully the pool will be a bit warmer next time!

The room is extremely large, with an even larger bathroom - which had both a round tub and a large shower. The shower area is open-air, which can be definitely romantic, however, we did have some friendly birds get trapped inside the bathroom, and some insects roaming around as well. 

The staff and owner (who lives on site) are very friendly, and there is a snooker table as well as board games for those rainy days in. Dinner and breakfast are a la carte, so it may not make sense to purchase half board, as opposed to just ordering what you want to eat on the day, as the menu is the same. If you want to go watch the turtles after dinner, make sure you ask for an early dinner slot. We were told that 1 hour was enough, but we had to skip dessert because 1.5hrs into the meal we were still not served. 

The infinity pool is gorgeous, and very relaxing (although a bit cold).","A very colourful place to stay","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r967335723-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

I proudly share your heartfelt review with the team this morning, as it underlines for us all that we are still ‘on-message’; that a hotel can be more than a bed for the night if only it tries.

Your kind words of support touch us all, thank you, and will surely inspire others who seek a sanctuary aspiring to send everyone home with fond memories, memories of a country I am lucky to call home.

Keeping everyone happy all of the time is a lofty aspiration to say the least, given the diversity of a travelers needs, their age, expectations and past experience, so, when we see it on their face and are told that we have our efforts are all the more worthwhile. Thank you for sharing your happiness with us and the world on this forum.
 
Lastly, thanks again for your valuable good custom and great company, we enjoyed your time with us but wish it had been longer. I wish you and your family a very healthy and blissfully happy life – and hope you keep us on the ‘must return’ list always - and yes please, for a longer stay!

"1","962023581","en","1943029",,"Owner","962316704","en","2024-07-29","Buckingham Place","Exceptional review, exceptional guests...

Sincere thanks on behalf us all. Thanks for returning, bringing your friends, for supporting us magnificently with your custom and this second, truly exceptional review – above all, thank you for becoming part of this place and our lives.

We all use hotels, have our favorites and occasionally return, but rarely do we expect or find more than a bed for the night and (usually) something to complain about! Often, our ‘baggage’ goes before us to make us cynical and wary of what to expect of the hotel, its staff and fellow travelers. Thus, we keep our guard up and ourselves to ourselves, invariably missing what’s in front of our eyes including the good company of others. Not so with you! From the minute you arrived for your first stay to the end of your last, you made yourselves at home in every sense, endearing yourselves to the entire team, other guests and me personally. To read your remarkable accolade ours is your 'second home and the absolute benchmark by which we judge elsewhere’ I am genuinely moved. Yes, we see you as regulars already, but there was no question by the end of your first stay you would become so, and I look forward to sharing Christmas with you both and then welcome you back next July. You are the very first to book another two stays before leaving the hotel – this is an amazing compliment, I thank you again.            

All guests are special, nothing is too much trouble and everyone deserves to go home with fond memories has become our ethos. Some folk however, as you do, sprinkle a little magic of their own to make their holiday happier, both for themselves and others. You bring out the best in us with your empathy, sensitivity and not least, sense of humour, especially when we get it wrong as inevetbly we do at times. Personally, sharing time with you is not just ‘my job as host but a privalege – even when you’re a grumpy old man!!    

Thanks for your valuable custom, great company and OUR happy memories. Until next time, take care of yourselves, keep living life to the full while sharing the magic you are as a couple with every soul that you meet.  

Big hugs from us all

Thank you, for coming to stay, for being so sociable and, for this perfect review. We certainly could not have wished to host a more delightful family, only you had been able to stay longer. We meet far too few Danish travelers so your review will help change that I hope. To those who might read this and know us already, warm greetings from Rekawa please come again soon. For other contemplating a visit please be assured of a warm welcome and memories for a lifetime!

Your kind empathy and respect for the team and me personally was second to none. I am so pleased you met us at our best and enjoyed an experience not just another bed for the night. I hope you will return and discover Sri Lanka is a much bigger island than it looks on a map, but for now, I’ll simply say we were privaleged to host you and wish you always, happy and safe travels and a blissfully happy life!

Sri Lanka surprises most on their first visit, and for many, continues doing so time after time. My own early experiences of the islands glorious diversity, idiosyncrasies and welcoming spirit are what brought me back and hefted me to the island for the last 22 years. There is so much to do, even within a short radius of the hotel, and the same can be said of pretty much everywhere here. I’m delighted you’ve sampled this for yourselves with a wonderful holiday, but also that this was only the first of many equally wonderful visits.

I only wish we could have stayed for longer than 3 nights as it is the perfect place to kick back and relax. The rooms are extremely spacious (the large redundant space in the bathroom is calling out for a freestanding bath!) and comfortable. 

We loved the pool area and the pool table in the games room was well used by my sons. The beach is accessible through the hotel grounds - although the sea was too rough to even paddle during our stay, it’s a lovely stretch to walk along. We were even accompanied by Bella the very friendly hotel dog on one of our walks!

The food in the vibrant restaurant is fantastic - there were some great alternatives to curry which we’d rather had our fill of by the end of the trip. The breakfast crepes and the seared tuna were delicious and my boys were very appreciative of the Marmite and Heinz Ketchup! 

The staff at Buckingham Place are a real credit to the hotel - attentive, accommodating and hospitable throughout. 

Thank you Buckingham Place for a magical end to a wonderful holiday in Sri Lanka.","Repeat visit required!","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2260795-d1943029-r960200216-Buckingham_Place-Rekawa_Netolpitiya_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",

Thank you very much indeed, we are over the moon this morning having read your review – it is pinging’ around the team as I write! 

Yours is a delightful family and a genuine pleasure to host. Everyone enjoyed serving you and appreciated your empathy and sincere respect. It could go without saying really, we would be thrilled to welcome you back.

As you know, we can keep guests busy if they want to be, but most are similar to yourselves, they simply yearn a place to slip off their wristwatch and kick off their shoes unashamedly, a place where a little laziness is embraced. It was a joy seeing you relax, or as I say go-with-the-program, So thank you choosing us for some feet-up time, and for following up with this beautiful review. Your kind praise is perfectly timed and will certainly help us, as folks in you footsteps begin planning their winter hols. As for it being a dream to return? Please keep reminiscing until you make that dream come true - you would be surprised by how many do return, the really lucky ones come year after year! 

Thank you. Until next time and always I wish you safe and happy travels, enduring fond memories and, a blissfully happy life!

Thank you for being lovey sweet guests and such good sports...

We are all proud to read your perfect review this morning and, delighted you enjoyed your week at Buckingham Place so much. That you can recommend the hotel so highly (even during our off-season) is hugely reassuring for those in your footsteps, it was a pleasure and privalege to host you and so terribly easy! Your presence was akin to having a couple of old friends to stay - fun to swap stories and relax with. I politely suggest however, don't leave it so long before your next holiday? Even I need to take one occasionally - we all do!!

Your review is as good as they get and truly helpful written in your language This year we’ve welcomed the gradual return of travelers from your country and send warm wishes to all our friends in Germany, old and new.

Thank you again for bringing your valuable good custom to us. and, for your excellent company and a perfect review. It’s a big world filled with choice I know. Nonetheless, I hope you’ll return to Sr Lanka and stay with us again – there is much more to see and do on the island and we’d be thrilled to welcome you back of course. In the meantime and always, I wish you good health and much happiness from us all. 

Warm wishes and hugs,

Nick & the Team

Das Hotel ist ein wahres Paradies. Die Zimmer sind stilvoll und geräumig, und der Pool lädt zum Relaxen ein. Besonders hervorzuheben sind die vielfältigen Frühstücksvarianten und die flexiblen Zeiten, die es uns ermöglichten, ganz entspannt in den Tag zu starten.
Die Küche bietet sehr raffinierte Zubereitungen und hat uns immer wieder begeistert.

Die leise, aber stets präsente Aufmerksamkeit des Teams hat unseren Aufenthalt perfekt gemacht. Wir können das Buckingham Place wärmstens empfehlen.

As I ‘ping’ your wonderful compliments around the team this morning, they are replying with ‘smileys’ and ‘thumbs up' plus, you humble me mercilessly so I’m blushing!!

It’s our off-season as you know, so you’ve seen us at our worst, grey skies, rain an’ all. That you enjoyed your stay no less and write so passionately about it is both testimony to the hotel and your experience as a well seasoned traveler. I am so pleased that you had a good time and your stay gave you some much needed feet up time. 

Your review is simply spectacular and as good as they get. It reassures everyone in your footsteps or wavering, that Sri Lanka is good to go whatever the season. Rarely are visitors inconvenienced by the weather in Sri Lanka, not unless they come purely for a sun tan, if anything it’s rainy seasons that keep our gardens and this wonderful island lush and beautiful.

Thank you for coming to stay and for supporting us so eloquently and passionately. Everyone whom you met enjoyed spoiling you both, whilst I enjoyed your enthusiasm and great company immensely. So now you’ve found us, please don’t be strangers.

Until next time..

I call it a property but it's way more than that...for me it's so relaxing and inviting, you actually don't want to do anything but forget everything and bask in the warmth and kick back and chill. The rooms are beautiful, bathrooms are wonderful, the food and ambience just tremendous. This is a true GEM and not to be missed. Nick you open your arms to everyone what a beautiful quality and it really is home.

While swimming in the pool, the bar staff approached me at just the right moment to offer a drink. I had an arrack-based cocktail, which was absolutely delightful.

The evening sundowner was a luxurious experience, sipping cocktails while watching the sunset and the campfire. At night, I was able to see countless stars, creating a very romantic atmosphere.

The safari tour was also incredibly enjoyable. A knowledgeable ranger, well-versed in the behavior of the animals, guided us to many wonderful encounters. Although it was disappointing not to see a leopard, I felt very fortunate to spot a rare sloth bear.

One small issue was the communication with the hotel’s dedicated staff via WhatsApp. Responses were not always timely, which caused some inconvenience during luggage handling at check-out.

From the moment we stepped out of our transfer vehicle we were greeted with smiles and the warmest of welcomes, and this heightened level of hospitality continued throughout our entire stay. Our curator was Rohan, who made our stay even more exceptional.
The rooms: we had a family suite which consisted of a master lodge and a smaller adjoining lodge. Both were decadent, and gave us and the kids a sense of being an explorer in times gone past. Leather and copper abounded the rooms, and clever designed and opulent furniture made the room not just aesthetically pleasing, but also functional and not in the least cluttered. So much so that we barely used the second room. The deck was lovely and contained a nice sized 1.3m deep pool which had an extra ambience in the evening. The kids and us loved it, and it was the perfect spot to read and take a refreshing dip.
The food: excellent, even for the harshest critics. A great variety for both adults and children, with options that changed each day. Sri Lanka staples and international fare ensured a difficult decision each meal, as I could have had every meal a second and third time, but forced myself to try a new dish each sitting. The seafood platter was exceptional, and contained locally caught lobster, prawns and crab - to name just a small portion of its contents.
The bar: a great place to enjoy an ice cold beer or a cocktail whilst the kids enjoyed the iconic pool which adjoined the bar and overlooked the stunning beach.
The Safaris: amazing. We had small children and did the early morning one and the evening one, and saw an abundance of wildlife on both, including what everyone comes to see - a leopard. Irrespective of seeing the leopard, the whole experience was unforgettable as we had the most amazing guide Saranga, who had such a wealth of knowledge on not just the animals, but the country as a whole, and truly engaged with both our children and us. The safari experience is tailored to each guest, and this made it even more perfect.
Extra facilities: the didn’t use the spa, but did so at the sister resort in Weligama, and had a fantastic experience there. I can only imagine it would be of a similar high quality. The library was cute and contained plenty of local literature which I found fascinating.
The beach: rugged and beautiful, but you don’t come here to swim in it. There are sundowners each night on the grounds leading up to the beach where you can catch an amazing sunset and whilst being visited by monkeys, spotted deer and even an elephant if you are lucky! We had both of the former, but not the latter. There is also a special beach dinner provided by an open fire where you can experience the delicious food, whilst stargazing and being soothed by the sound of the sea. An amazing experience.
I could continue on, but the above is a small summary of our experience.
Would I return? Yes, in a heartbeat, as would the whole family.
Would I recommend the resort? Yes, to solo travellers, families with our without kids of any ages. This resort is for EVERYONE!
Will we return? I can only hope we do one day, as it is one of a kind and a highlight for even the most well travelled","Rugged and decadent, truly unforgettable","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r985778137-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Clever gardening and ponds shield accomodation pods from one another. It is misleading to call the air conditioned, insulated, double glazed, bug and crawly proof comfort capsules 'tents' but they do feel like it. Just not like tents you would carry on your back. 
We enjoyed a driving safari and on day two a morning nature walk. It's a special skill to interpret a foreign landscape to a visitor. Not merely to guide a safari but add layer upon layer of insight and meaning. Suranga has it. 
And the sharp eye. I had not really expected to see a leopard AND a pangolin on the first pass. 
But the real treat was a simple walk along the foreshore and back into the dunes where he added layers of scent and flavour 'here try it - we use it for diabetes' superimposed on the tracks of a leopard, crocodile close up (it was still a cool morning and we approached from the rear), scat analysis and why it was a leopard and what he had been eating. Then there was the geology, the botany, the sociology of poaching and cultural change. I hadn't realised I was interested in ornithology - but thanks to Su I am now.","Most comfortable tents","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r983155817-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Before our arrival, there was some confusion around the payment process, as the lodge requested full payment despite our deposit already being made. It took several emails to resolve this, which was a bit frustrating. However, once we arrived, any lingering irritation melted away—the lodge is truly extraordinary.

The tented lodges are a masterpiece of design, both inside and out. Stepping into our tent felt like stepping back in time, yet with every modern comfort imaginable. There wasn’t a single thing we needed that wasn’t already thoughtfully provided. The attention to detail is exemplary, making it a luxurious retreat unlike any other.

Now, let’s talk about the food—just delicious! Each meal was a culinary delight, and the quality was consistently exceptional. While the cost per night is certainly on the higher end, it’s genuinely worth it. You’re well taken care of, with food and drink provided to such a high standard that you never feel the pinch of the price.

The only downside to our stay was the safari experience. Unfortunately, our ranger didn’t seem very knowledgeable, which detracted from what should have been one of the core highlights of our trip. That said, Yala National Park is breathtaking. We were lucky enough to see elephants, spotted deer, buffalos, and a variety of birds, though no sloth bears or leopards.

Even with the safari disappointment, I would still highly recommend Wild Coast Tented Lodge for the quality of the tented accommodation alone. It’s an experience I’ll remember for years to come.

We last visited this amazing resort in 2020 and my husband & son were amazed at how they have maintained the resort so well that it still seems as if it is brand new. 

However what always impresses us at every Dilmah hotel / resort is the incredible people working  there and the amazing attention to every detail they put in to giving you better than world class service. 

The team at wild coast has always pampered & spoilt us and this trip has been no different for my husband & son. 

They were warmly greeted at the hotel by Sanduruwan & Sashi the curator who organized their stay. Aishira kept them both entertained with his charm  and ensured they were always looked after with food & drinks in abundance. Aishira’s special & unique fruit mocktails which he makes off the menu is simply fabulous and a must try. No 2 mocktails are ever the same!! Mostly my Husband & son were incredibly happy to have met Chef Chintaka who made them fabulous customized food for their exact dietary requirements which was simply divine. They were overwhelmed by how kind and attentive he was. He spent time talking to my son and understanding his food preferences and helped introduce him to new foods which is something we really struggle with!!

Honestly we keep coming back because no other hotel treats us this well where we feel like we are surrounded by family. The kindness & joy is infectious. You feel better about everything after a night here. 

We can’t talk about wild coast tented lodge without talking about the incredible safari into Yala park. My husband & son had the adventure of going on 2 trips into Yala with the well spoken, highly experienced, extremely entertaining and incredibly knowledgeable Ranger Kasun. With his incredible tracking skills of listening to monkey warning calls and observing tracks on the ground my husband & son managed to see leopards on both trips into Yala. On the 2nd trip they had the rare privilege of seeing a female leopard with her cub drinking water together at a watering hole. 

This place is a must visit for any vacation to Sri Lanka. Be it for family’s, couples or singles. It’s an experience of a life time. 

Many thanks to all the incredible staff who make this experience possible.","The best Yala experience","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r970873288-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Regarding the overall accommodations, all I can stay that it was stunning. The cocoon suite accommodation was so unique and we enjoyed our pool time in the private pool. Staying in the middle of nature, waking up to bird calls was so beautiful and much needed after living in the urban jungle. Watching the mighty Indian Ocean beat against the beach and rocks was mesmerizing; we could have watched this for hours. Secondly, we had the all-inclusive package and had 2 game drives. We did an afternoon and a morning game drive. Our guide, ranger Kasun, and driver, Kumar, did an excellent job showing us Yala National Park and the various animals, including quickly getting us to a leopard sighting one morning. You can tell how passionate Ranger Kasun was about the animals and preserving nature. Lastly, the service and food at the resort was truly exceptional. We had some long drives and the staff made sure that we always had water and to go snack boxes with us.  All the staff at the bar and restaurant went above and beyond in making sure we were taken care of. All the meals - definitely try all the curries - and drinks were delicious. While we did not do the afternoon tea (because we were so full from breakfast and lunch), we did have the amazing Sri Lankan tea. The canapés at the sundowner were also very flavorful. Unfortunately it rained both afternoons we were there so we did the sundowners at the bar rather than the cliff overlooking the ocean. We would love to go back and stay here!","Amazing Glamping Experience in Yala National Park","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r968074713-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Yes, it’s expensive but it ticked off all of our boxes: near Yala National Park, on the ocean, private and comfortable rooms with personalized service, sustainable mission, and all-inclusive safaris and delicious food and drink.  The facility is beautifully designed to blend into the park flora and fauna with as little environmental impact as possible. The unique cocoon suites (most with private plunge pool) are located around watering holes that attracts wildlife.  We watched monkeys frolicking in the trees and watering hole from our cocoon.  Yes, there can be other wildlife around since this is a fence less property: elephants, leopards, snakes, buffaloes, etc.  That is why you have to be escorted by a staff person around the property at night.  But the main reason to come here is the private safaris., and you get one each day. Since you are staying at the Resort, you bypass the line of jeeps waiting to get into the park (and there can be as many as 100 jeeps in that line).  Tauranga was our ranger/guide for our two safaris as well as a late afternoon walk to a nearby tank.  He freely shared his knowledge of wildlife, birds and trees of Yala with us and best of all has an excellent eye for wildlife.  With his help,  we were lucky enough to view a leopard watching a crocodile eating a boar during our afternoon safari, and lots of elephants and birds.  There is no guarantee to see wildlife,  but it’s still a fun and unique experience.  Bring your own binoculars, water and a scarf (it can get dusty on the open air jeep).  After our safaris, we were welcomed back with cool towels, drink and dinner in the restaurant.  It’s a Relais & Chateaux so we were not disappointed by the delicious and varied food and drink selections.  I was celebrating my birthday, so we were surprised by a dinner on the beach on our last night.  This is the luxury way to experience a Yala safari; highly recommended!","Safari glamping to the max!","2024-08","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r967740433-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Our family Cocoon had incredible interior and was spotlessly clean. The cleanliness was maintained brilliantly despite the jungle location by our lovely housekeeper Chathuranga who came twice a day ,morning and evening for turn down. We noticed everything being freshened up and details like slippers and water being put by our bed. The best turn down we experienced  in Sri Lanka. 

The restaurant was fantastic, dining there one would never believe that you were in the middle of the jungle, the choice and presentation of foods was incredible. As vegetarians we were well catered for. The croissants at breakfast were the best we’ve ever tasted outside of Paris!! Our teenage sons are both autistic and they prefer more simple foods. After conversation with restaurant manager Chamika, he kindly allowed them  to eat from the kids menu and allowed any modifications they needed to be comfortable. Chamika is a genuinely warm and caring gentleman and really put us at ease regarding these requests. Thank you so very much Chamika this was really appreciated by all of us as a family. 

Through no fault at all of the hotel one of our sons was unwell during our stay, twice in the restaurant as it happens. The staff were incredibly kind to us, in particular I wanted to mention Tilshan. He walked with my son and I back to our room both times, helped him to freshen up outside of the restaurant and was just generally caring and accommodating. He was often our sever in the restaurant and carefully remembered all of our particular orders, we really are so grateful to him. I also wanted to mention Rhunini in the restaurant, as we understood she is new to the team and currently in training. We found her to be an incredibly kind, attentive and proactive young lady who is so mature and we have no doubt a bright future in hospitality ahead of her. 

We were on the all inclusive package and as a result we had 3 game drives included in our stay. We were extremely fortunate to have been allocated Shani as our ranger. At present the only female ranger in Yala national park!! What an inspiring lady, who was so kind and patient. Shani was so concerned the morning that my husband and son were missing from a game drive after my son had been unwell, thankfully he was better for our final game drive and she went out of her way to make sure he was happy and comfortable that afternoon. Shani has a vast knowledge of all the wildlife, despite being relatively new to this position. Her passion for her country’s animals and birds was infectious. We thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent with her on all three of the game drives, she answered all our questions and along with the two drivers we had; was so patient in allowing to watch, listen and take as much time as we needed to enjoy a moment whenever we stopped. 

We were fortunate to see leopards twice on our last day (morning and evening) Shani was genuinely so happy that my son who had been unwell had also managed to see one after missing out that morning. We also saw a pair of the very rare black neck storks during our final game drive. This was all incredible and we felt so lucky, however we have to say it was such a privilege to see every animal, bird and reptile that we did. Shani we can never thank you enough for 3 amazing drives; giving us an introduction to Sri Lankan wildlife; making us want to visit Yala again and allowing us to create many happy family memories. 

One small negative was the pressure we felt at the end of the stay here by our host to provide a review. We completely understand the importance of reviews particularly in Sri Lanka, however an email to both my husband and I in the middle of our final game drive about this really wasn’t the time! When we returned to the property to finally relax at the sundowners;  with our son feeling much better, wishing to enjoy the moment and reflect on our game drive,  we were approached by the host and asked again to complete a review! In my opinion it would be better to allow guests to enjoy their holiday moments and discuss this at check out. I don’t know if this is happens with every guest or if it was just us at these timings?There were numerous WhatsApps around that time in the group set up by host, for communication during our stay which made us felt it was all about a review. Yet the same gentleman hadn’t cared to check in with us to see if our son was ok the morning after being quite  unwell the night before, when everyone else we saw immediately asked if he was alright. When it was review time the texts were numerous!! We personally don’t appreciate this kind of pressure. As a family we will be the first to give thanks, praise and give feedback verbally when it’s deserved. We almost always write reviews too, but in our own time. We prefer to relax and be present in the moment when on holiday and leave the reviews until we are home. Please take this into consideration! Other than this we really had a lovely stay, thank you to all of the team for your hospitality.","Beautiful Yala.","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d12973489-r967232633-Wild_Coast_Tented_Lodge_Relais_Chateaux-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

отель небольшой , каскадная территория , различный номерной фонд . 
проживали в номере категории  deluxe junior suite with sea view
очень просторный номер выполненный в местном дизайне с добротной деревянной мебелью и  балкон с потрясающий видом на океан и окрестности . 
ванная просторная - есть душ и ванная , ежедневная уборка номера и замена полотенец, чистое постельное белье, мини- бар-платный / ежедневное пополнение. 
Так как отель расположен на склоне горы в джунглях, то на территории отеля обитают бурундучки , павлины , обезьяны и можно увидеть варана по дороге на пляж. 
По питанию : брали завтрак и ужин , ассортимент лаконичный , столы не ломятся от изобилия, но всегда вкусно. 
на завтрак : вкусная каша на кокосовом молоке , индивидуально готовят яичницу и сладкие блинчики, овощи, сухой завтрак , местные фрукты и потрясающие смузи, вкусное кофе- есть кофемашина профессиональная , играет фоном спокойная музыка и открывается потрясающий вид на океан с террасы. 
на ужин: всегда свежая рыба, приготовят для Вас индивидуально , тунец и креветки -на грили, несколько видов риса, картофель, курица, 2-3 салата, фрукты и мороженое , сладости . 
Алкоголь на ужин платный , играет живая музыка - прекрасная атмосфера . 
За каждым номером - зарезервирован стол на ужин, что очень удобно . 
Хочу отметить работу ребят официантов - общительные , шустрые , улыбчивые и очень внимательные.
Отель расположен рядом 3 пляжами, до одного пляжа- спускаемся из отеля и попадаем на пляж- лагуна, большую часть времени океан спокойный, можно спокойно купаться кто едет с детьми или кто не уверенно держится на воде . 
До двух других - можно дойти пешком 20 и 30 мин , или договорится с ребятами с отеля, они Вас довезут и привезут в назначенное время , по стоимости не скажу, так как ходили пешком. На данных  пляжах можно ощутить мощь самого океана и покататься на волнах . 
От отеля , спускаясь в низ к дороге можно на тук-туке или рейсовом автобусе - добраться до городка Тангалле - где есть фруктовый рынок , алко лавки и сувенирные магазины. Рядом с отелем никакой инфраструктуры - нет . 
Отель рекомендую для спокойного отдыха в дали от шума и суеты, кто хочет наслаждаться прекрасным рассветом и закатом сидя на террасе с бокалом вина, просыпаться и засыпать под шум океана и пения птиц.","просыпаться и засыпать под шум океана и пения птиц...","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r941517294-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Breakfast and dinner were included in the stay, breakfast was very nice, especially coffee and tea. Dinner was based on primarily seafood of excellent quality and presentation which my parents absolutely adored. 

There is a stunning beach within 5 minutes of walking distance, it is very safe to swim without any currents. You can rent a lounge chair there for an extra price if you like. The lounge chairs were very comfortable.

There are plenty of opportunities to book a tour (private or with a group). My parents went to Galle (a beautiful city with some Dutch influence).

Я очень долго и скрупулезно выбирала отель для отдыха на Шри-Ланке, изучала побережья, отели, отзывы. И наткнувшись на этот отель, у меня не осталось сомнений: я хочу только сюда и точка. И не ошиблась. Он действительно оказался самым лучшим. Даже больше. Наши ожидание оправдались и даже более, чем мы ожидали!

Самый теплый персонал, который помогает во всем и сразу же решает все вопросы и проблемы. Заказ такси, тук туков – все можно доверить им. Тут реально чувствуешь себя, как дома. Такого я не встречала нигде. 

Персонал запоминает все предпочтения каждого из семьи, если кто-то не пришел на завтрак, то волнуются и спрашивают, где остальные))

Отдельно хочется сказать про хозяина отеля Mr. Nuwan – это человек широкой души. Постоянно спрашивал как наши дела, смеялся и шутил с нами, был в курсе всех наших дел. И очень сильно помог мне, когда со мной случился небольшой казус на пляже. Человек, которому действительно не все равно. Даже наш туроператор среагировал позже и с нулевым энтузиазмом, когда в то же время Mr. Nuwan сделал все, чтобы помочь. Большое спасибо, Mr. Nuwan ❤️

В отеле самые вкусные завтраки: каждое утро фреши, блинчики, омлеты, фрукты. На ужин всегда морепродукты, рыба, вкуснейшие салаты, десерты, мороженое.

Каждый вечер живая музыка, где переодически поет и сам хозяин. Волшебнейшая атмосфера.

Этот отель, отношение хозяина и персонала влюбили нас полностью. Если ехать на Шри-Ланку, то только сюда!

Мы посетили много стран, отелей, но такой заботы не встречали нигде.

Отель только разрастается, здесь будет большой бассейн, еще один ресторан, новые корпуса. 

Успехов и развития отелю и Mr. Nuwan!

А сколько подарков: чай, деревянный слоник нам подариои. Но даже дело не в них. Главный подарок: это атмосфера в отеле и отношение его людей. Это дороже всего ❤️

За приемами пищи пустая тарелка не задерживается на столе дольше минуты, за всеми следят сотрудники и тут же все убирают даже при высокой загруженности отеля. И каждый день живая музыка! Хозяин каждый день находится в отеле и разговаривает с каждым гостем, также помогает в решении вопросов. Это был наш лучший отдых!!! Очень рекомендуем.","Прекрасный отдых в Шри-Ланке","2024-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r939147909-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

С первого дня пребывания, персонал отеля проявлял внимание и заботу во всем что было связано с нашим отдыхом. К примеру, они знали что нам нужно ехать на экскурсию и перенесли время завтрака на 30мин раньше относительно расписания. На второй день пребывания, я попал в больницу из за того что наступил на морского ежа, администрации ни чего не сказал и самостоятельно отправился в больницу, но к вечеру персонал отеля уже был в курсе моей ситуации, администратор приехал в больницу меня навестить а на утро прислали машину за мной из отеля. Отдельно хотелось бы отметить что весь персонал хорошо знает английский и не возникает никаких проблем в общении и взаимопонимании. Расположение отеля на возвышении и вид из ресторанный зоны и номера на индийский океан и нереально красивые закаты - это отдельный большой плюс. Говоря про Маяви обязательно нужно сказать что кухня здесь лучшая из 4х отелей и нескольких баров что мы посетили за время пребывания на острове! А ещё ребята умеют готовить настоящий борщ, не какое то подобие а именно настоящий борщ на свекле, после домашнего, этот борщ теперь в моем личном топе борщей из-за границы))) не хватало только сала) Детей тоже удавалось накормить,  хотя это не простая задача даже дома( у нас их 3е).

Тут случился мой самый лучший ланкийский отдых. Уютные новые номера, отличная кухня, свежейшие морепродукты и фрукты, замечательные люди, приятная живая музыка, рядом самый красивый пляж, бассейн с видом (и строят еще один), коктейли, вино, обезьяны, павлины, зелень… что еще нужно?
При заезде нам улучшили номер, что было неожиданно и очень приятно.
Биг босс контролирует качество предоставляемых услуг и угощает вином)
Я заранее связалась с отелем и запросила возможность нанять водителя-гида и мне всё без проблем организовали.
На месте тоже решают быстро любые вопросы.
Вообще, такого внимания к нам нигде не было. Было так хорошо, что могу прослезиться от воспоминаний)
Мы с мужем очень довольны. Честно рекомендуем этот отель всем путешественникам. Особенно хорошо будет парам.

От аэропорта до отеля путь занимает около 1 часа по хорошей дороге. Сам отель очень удачно вписан в природный ландшафт, расположен ярусами на возвышенности, утопая в зелени, полное ощущение жизни в джунглях. Дорога на ближайший пляж около 7 минут, обратно возращение в горку. Можно на тук-туке доехать до соседнего пляжа - минут 10-12. По дороге на пляж среди кустов встречаются вараны, по деревьям прыгают обезьяны (но совсем не навязчивые и людей боятся), на балкон прилетают павлины, а в океане вдоль берега плавают гигантские черепахи! Природа восхитительная! Сказка! Океан волшебный! Несмотря на волны, мы наслаждались каждый день! Сам отель новый, очень чистый с прекрасными завтраками и очень вкусными ужинами, по запросу возможен индивидуальный обед. Морепродукты на ужине подаются ежедневно, всегда свежий улов, качество превосходное!  По вечерам несколько раз в неделю местная музыкальная группа играет во время ужина, я каждый раз с удовольствием слушала их выступление и даже определила для себя пару фаворитов из популярных шри-ланкийских песен)) Уборка номеров и смена белья регулярная. Очень хорошее качество предоставленных средств по уходу - шампунь и кондиционер для волос с нежнейшим ароматом. Отдельного отзыва заслуживает персонал - абсолютно все работники очень вежливые, отзывчивые и дружелюбные.

Тут полный релакс!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Хочу начать отзыв с огромной благодарности всей команде отеля, а так же владельцу. Вы огромные молодцы, что делаете такую атмосферу, что чувствуешь себя, как дома, в кругу близких друзей и родственников. Мы много путешествовали, но такого подхода и отношения не было нигде. Это действительно кайф. 

Теперь по поводу отеля. Скажу сразу, мы побывали в разных отелях на Шри-Ланке и по местным меркам, именно по меркам Шри-Ланки, этот отель можно назвать лучшим на острове или одним из лучших. Тут и виды на океан, почти с каждого номера, и в пешей доступности разные пляжи, в том числе, один из лучших на острове Silent Beach. Кормят классно, тут действительно можно забыть о том, где ты находишься, в плане еды, так как по большей части везде не вкусно, а в отеле вкусно всегда, пусть не так разнообразно, чем в какой-нибудь Турции, но все что есть - вкусно и качественно. Каждый ужин морепродукты, какие хотите и сколько хотите. От креветок до крабов и лобстеров. Можно попросить приготовить и целую рыбу. Алкоголь по отдельному прайсу, который немного завышен, но всегда можно доехать до винного магазина и купить там все, что угодно. Так же в отеле можно купить отборный Цейлонский чай и украшения. 

Всем очень рекомендую данный отель для спокойного и размеренного отдыха. Тут нет никакой суеты и не будет. Много живности вокруг, в номерах чисто, уборка каждый день. Если есть какие-то насекомые, можно попросить их убрать и они это сделают. Никакого дискомфорта. Все на высшем уровне!","Отпуск удался!","2023-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r930851869-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Также брали пару раз обед в отеле, который был доставлен в номер, что не могло не порадовать. На территории отеля видели павлинов, обезьян, варанов, что создавало особую атмосферу. Насекомые, тараканы в номере отсутствуют( за это очень переживали , так как были наслышаны про это на Шри Ланке).

Нас встретил прекрасный администратор Асанка. Через туроператора мы брали номер с видом на ""сад"". Прочитав отзывы здесь, сразу спросили можно ли взять другой с доплатой и посмотреть. Он нам показал все номера: наш, такой же с видом на океан и балконом и самый классный номер кинг (который тут есть на фото от отеля) - поняли, что наш не отличается от второго варианта (на виды мы смотреть из номера не успевали), а кинг стоил +50 долларов в сутки. Поэтому остались в своем, и вообще ни разу не пожалели. Нас, также как и всех тут писавших, встретили кокосом и ожерельем из цветов) 
Уборка была каждый день, 4 бутылки воды по 0,5 ежедневно пополнялись, зубные щетки и паста были, шампунь, гель и кондиционер пополнялись не каждый день, но мы не израсходовали в ноль, поэтому не напрягало, по 2 полотенца и одно ножное также обновлялись ежедневно. 
Мы постоянно общались с персоналом: просто на завтраке или ужине, просили заказать тук-тук, они всегда были приветливы, что тоже очень подкупает.
Мы планировали поездку в Галле сами, просто погулять. Попросили помочь с этим Асанка - найти трансфер, он нашел, но цена нас не совсем устроила, и он нашел для нас дешевле. Это тоже было очень приятно.
Мы брали только завтрак (советую брать завтрак-ужин), 2 раза отель звал нас на ужин бесплатно, в последний наш вечер на ужине один напиток был бесплатно. Завтраки немного однообразные, а ужины очень вкусные - всегда морепродукты и рыба, невероятный местный рис и много чего еще.
3 раза в неделю живая музыка на ужине.
Рядом 2 пляжа - тут уже много раз все писали, останавливаться не буду.
По поводу кафешек рядом - советую Сайлет поинт бич (там подешевле), напротив отеля кафе Ага серф - все вкусно, много чего брали. но подороже.
Несколько раз общались с хозяином отеля, спрашивал нас, что можно еще добавить в завтраки. Приятно, что интересуется (но прислушается ли, мы не знаем).
На прощание нам подарили 2 пачки чая, и честно, мы пожалели, что не привезли чего-то для персонала, особенно для Асанки - он просто супер)
Мы очень довольны отелем и отпуском, если вы рассматриваете его - езжайте! Да, там есть насекомые, вараны, но это не минус, а факт, если хотите на Шри Ланку, то там везде они. Отель заслуживает свои 5 звезд, я бы и больше дала. У нас остались только положительные впечатления от пребывания в этом отеле.","Прекрасный отель с прекрасным персоналом","2023-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g16744467-d23926606-r926877427-Mayavee_Resort_Spa-Unakuruwa_Southern_Province.html",

Отель находится выше уровня моря, как только поднимаешься к бару-вид на океан просто завораживает!!! Отель построен в 2021 году, номера расположены на разных уровнях, что выглядит очень современно и стильно, можете наслаждаться закатами и океаном прямо из номера, отель очень «камерный», примерно на 20 номеров, буквально утопает в зелени, пальмы разных видов, бамбук, много цветущих деревьев и кустарников, где прячутся птички, павлины ходят по крышам, милые бурундуки приходят в гости на веранды. Сами номера отлично сделаны, хороший ремонт, есть кондиционеры, смарт телевизоры, и вентиляторы под потолком и конечно отличный Wi-Fi. Мебель добротная, кровати новые, матрацы не пролежанные, сантехника современная.
Очень позитивный и невероятно доброжелательный персонал. При нашем очень слабом английском, но «активном» языке жестов-нас всегда понимали и старались во всем помогать!!!! Особое спасибо хочется выразить хозяину отеля- невероятно внимательный человек, ВСЕ просьбы гостей старается выполнить, даже самые незначительные, внимание к гостям просто КОЛОССАЛЬНОЕ! Он каждый вечер лично обходит на ужине гостей и каждому старается уделить внимание.
 Мы с друзьями жили в отдельных номерах на 1 этаже и обратились с просьбой к хозяину отеля заменить нам номера на высоких этажах, если будет такая возможность. У нашей подруги 10 ноября был день рождения, так узнав об этом- хозяин сделал нам ГРАНДИОЗНЫЙ подарок- предложил занять поистине КОРОЛЕВСКИЙ ЛЮКС -семейный номер с 2 террасами, джакузи, 3 отдельными спальнями, 3 санузлами и бассейном с рыбками в номере с существенной скидкой на доплату. Когда мы осмотрели номер, у нас не было слов, чтобы описать наши чувства от увиденного в нем, только немой ВОСТОРГ, все места и номера, где мы ранее отдыхали ни в какое сравнение не идут!
Огромное спасибо шеф-повару отеля: еда в отеле очень вкусная, без огромного количества специй, характерных для Азии, но так оригинально приготовлена, что не приедается. На ужин всегда было несколько видов рыбы, креветки, кальмары, тунец, которых Вам пожарят в любом количестве, без ограничений.
В этот отель хочется снова приехать и никогда не уезжать!! Рекомендую всем, кто хочет отдохнуть и посмотреть страну, именно его!

We stayed in the spacious Vayu Pool Villa, which was well-maintained and provided a tranquil retreat with a pristine private pool. The villa’s layout offered comfort, luxury, and privacy—ideal for a relaxing holiday.

Breakfasts at the resort began with a fresh fruit platter featuring a delightful selection of local fruits, a wonderful start to each day. The Sri Lankan breakfast with flavorful beef and fish curries was a standout, showcasing authentic local cuisine. For lunch, our parents enjoyed a delicious serving of fish and chips, while the southern-style fish in banana wrap was splendidly prepared and packed with flavor.

Dinner arrangements were memorable, with the first night set up on the beach for our family of six, including our parents. The beachside ambiance paired with a delicious meal made it an evening to remember. On the second night, our dinner in the garden, surrounded by candlelight under a starry sky, was truly magical. The fish was perfectly prepared, and our eight-year-old son loved the fish and chips so much he wanted it again!

To end the meals on a sweet note, we indulged in the chocolate chip sundae for dessert, which was absolutely fabulous and worth every bite.

The serene beachfront, attentive hospitality, and Aditya’s overall ambiance make it an idyllic holiday getaway. From the front desk to the restaurant team, the staff’s genuine warmth and dedication made us feel truly at home.

We had the pleasure of staying at Adithya Boutique Villa on the 7th of September, 2024, with a group of friends to celebrate a special occasion—our friend’s 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like celebrities! We were warmly greeted with beautiful aralia garlands and a refreshing passion fruit juice as our welcome drink, setting the tone for what would be an incredible experience.

The staff at Adithya Boutique Villa went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. They were not only attentive but always smiling, creating such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Their hospitality made us feel truly at home.

The villa itself is stunning, with its charming décor and serene ambiance making it the perfect getaway. We stayed for just one night, but it was an experience we’ll remember for a long time. Thank you, Adithya Boutique Villa, for an unforgettable stay. We can’t wait to return!

From the time I chose Aditya and made a reservation I was given the maximum support by the General manager Mr. Shamindra Fernando and the resident manager Mr. Susil. Every aspect of the arrangement were discussed and arranged to my absolute satisfaction. 

On arrival we were garlanded with fragrant frangipane flowers and served delicious fresh passion juice….there followed a wonderful tea service in the garden… we then chillaxed near the bar and the pool and thereafter dressed up for evening cocktails with delicious canapés and a super al fresco 4 course dinner under the stars. 

The staff, the service, the ambience, the decor,  the quality of the meals were amazing. 

On returning to my suite my room had been decorated to resemble a fairyland of candles with a wonderful banner wishing me a fabulous birthday. I have never been this spoilt and was truly touched by the care taken to make this day so special for me. 

Thank you Aditya for  making my dream of an amazing birthday come to life.

The place itself is quietly extraordinary: large and shady palm thatched huts in the depths of Sri Lanka, surrounded by wilderness; shared meals of delicious organic vegetarian food, lovingly cooked over fire by the radiantly kind villagers, with a rainbow of veg picked from the garden. 

The luxuries are simple and involve many hands: lanterns hung each evening to light the ways (there is no electricity at Ulpotha), pathways swept several times daily, so no shoes required. 

No internet or phone signal encourages deep rest, connection and conversation. 

And then there was the yoga journey led by Melissa Smith (@Melissa_smith_yoga on instagram). Melissa wove her deep knowledge of yoga together with a tender somatic approach: a combination that landed me in my practice and my body in new, subtle yet profound, ways. 

Two weeks at Ulpotha was medicine for the mind & body, spirit & soul.  I flew home feeling re-connected with myself, the natural world and my fellow humans. 

I intend to make Ulpotha an annual pilgrimage home to myself.","A time of deep re-connection, body and soul.","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r998732091-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

It’s hard to describe the magic of this retreat, where nature, yoga, and community blend so seamlessly to create something truly special.

The yoga classes were transformative and reinvigorated my love and passion for my practice. Georgia’s Iyengar sessions offered a depth and focus that pushed me to grow in ways I hadn’t imagined. The atmosphere she created within the group was equally powerful. Plus her ability to adjust and shift to the different needs of individuals was amazing.

The massages were pure indulgence. Sophie and Boris worked wonders.   It wasn’t just relaxation; it was like they were unlocking tension I didn’t even know I was holding.

And the food! Every meal was a burst of fresh, vibrant flavors, lovingly prepared with local ingredients. It wasn’t just sustenance; it felt like part of the healing process.

Mark’s care and attention as host ensured everything ran smoothly and I felt confident that we were in very safe hands. The villager's smiles and openness made me feel like I wasn’t just visiting—I was part of something bigger.

Ulpotha is more than a retreat. It’s a reset, a reconnection, and a reminder of what truly matters. I left with a lighter heart, a clearer mind, and a profound sense of gratitude.

Luckily for me Georgia Marnham was teaching who I had previously been taught by, and because she is such a wonderful teacher it was an easy decision to make.

Before I travelled I did some research, and everything I read filled me with high hopes. However once I arrived I’m very happy to say it exceeded my expectations in every regard.

No electricity, no WiFi, no mobile coverage might not be everybody’s cup of tea, but it suited me right down to the ground.

To have a complete digital detox (no screens for a fortnight!) was a brilliant gift to myself. I cannot recommend that aspect highly enough 

And that’s just the beginning!

The yoga, under the gentle, kind and knowledgable instruction of Georgia rekindled my love for the Iyengar methodology, another gift.

The food! Was a sumptuous feast of deliciousness at every meal. In my normal life in London I’m an omnivore, but the beautiful vegetarian food was so nourishing and made me feel so healthy that I would eat like that every day for the rest of my life if I could.

The accommodation had an elegantly creative simplicity to it. My hut was on the edge of the village, and I’d look out over a lush paddie field, with a horizon of jungles and hills stretching into the distance.

And everything was so green! 

Which may sound trite, but the lushness of the place combined with the absence of the sounds of traffic, or flight paths, or modernity is unbelievably relaxing.

Everyone who is a part of Ulpotha was hospitality personified, but I must make special mentions;

Mark, our host, was charming, friendly, professional, extremely knowledgable and endlessly patient. Nothing was too much trouble.

Boris and Sophie, the massage therapists were highly skilled and very therapeutic. Even more important (to me) they were great company! Boris especially had me in stitches all the time, and Sophie has a lovely gentleness of spirit.

I have already mentioned Georgia, but I must thank her again because without her I never would have attended Ulpotha.

I will most definitely be returning.

I’ll finish with this: in my normal life it’s all push, rush, scramble. Being in Ulpotha was a lesson that life doesn’t always have to be that way…","Best Iyengar retreat outside of Pune","2025-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r992729999-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

This isn't your typical yoga getaway; it's a working example of how tourism can actually benefit local communities and ecosystems.

What struck me most was their commitment to traditional farming practices. The retreat cultivates rare varieties of rice without chemical fertilizers, using water buffalo instead of tractors (which not only preserves the soil but creates zero emissions). The organic vegetables grown here supply the kitchen, and the traditional pest control methods they use - from neem seeds to ritual offerings - show how farming can work in harmony with nature rather than against it.

Accommodation is in traditional wattle and daub huts - naturally cooled and surprisingly comfortable. There's no electricity in the guest areas, which initially seemed daunting but quickly became liberating. The evening oil lamps create a magical atmosphere. The lack of modern amenities isn't about deprivation; it's about experiencing a lighter environmental footprint while connecting with a simpler way of life.

The yoga and Ayurveda treatments were excellent, but what really sets Ulpotha apart is how they've integrated these practices into a broader vision of sustainable living. The retreat employs local villagers, maintains traditional water management systems, and practices reforestation - they've planted thousands of trees since the project began.

A word of caution: if you're looking for air conditioning and infinity pools, this isn't your place. But if you want to experience how tourism could (and should) work - supporting local communities, preserving traditional knowledge, and treading lightly on the earth - Ulpotha offers something truly special. 

The most valuable thing one takes home isn’t just relaxation or better yoga practice, but a deep appreciation for how traditional wisdom might help us address modern environmental challenges. Seeing how this ancient village system naturally incorporates water conservation, biodiversity, and zero-waste principles was eye-opening.","An Authentic Eco-retreat That Sets the Standard for Sustainable Tourism","2024-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r990792306-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

We stayed one week and took part in Wade's excellent yoga classes two times a day (about 3 hours per day), as well as doing a 5 day Ayurvedic treatment.  We went as a blended family with our 4 kids (aged 19-28) and it was a huge success.  Being effectively 'off grid' for a week with no electricity or wifi (there was an area you can charge phones and get a tiny bit of wifi if you choose, but we didn't) was just fabulous - enabling a total disconnection from our daily lives, creating a glorious sense of freedom and head space that just isn't possible when running around in our usual busy lives.  Time to read, write, sleep!  Be pampered and learn about the healing power of Ayurveda. The yoga classes were excellent and delivered with professionalism and a big dose of humour so everyone could it enjoy it whatever their level and experience.  The food was heavenly and the local community who run this very special place were unfailingly warm, friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Brilliant front of house Mark was superb and looked after us at all times - nothing was too much trouble.  And Flo and Boris provided the most fabulous massages that we were able to enjoy - one free with the week's retreat and others in addition and worth every penny!  Honestly, we just loved every minute - and all the bickering monkeys, pottering peacocks and the odd snake added to the feel of really getting away from it all!  We will be back (again - it was a second visit for four of us).  Thank you Mark, Wade, Boris, Flo and all the wonderful local team for a fantastic start to 2025!","Unforgettable and very special week in a little slice of Paradise","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r989469252-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

Ulpotha does not advertise so the only way to discover it is via sites like this. The cost of a 2 week stay seemed quite a lot and it took me at least 2 years of procrastinating before I finally acknowledged the little seed that had lodged obstinately in my brain. Now, barely 3 weeks since I said goodbye to my fellow retreat companions and the unfailingly gracious team the makes up Ulpotha, I am optimistic that the fresh perspective on life that was gained over this extraordinary fortnight in such sublime surroundings has reset my vision of what is possible, forever. It's harder to ignore the increasingly grave difficulties facing the world now than it was when I first started wandering around the planet almost 60 years ago, so when an example of what is possible when humans choose to live in harmony with their surroundings, well, it would be churlish not to make that discovery transformational in one's own daily activities.

Under Georgia's guidance in her two-week Iyengar yoga course, I noticed significant progress in my practice. The transformation in both body and mind started happening after the first week, marking an improvement I hadn't anticipated. Additionally, her ability to attract such a wonderful group of individuals to join her retreats added an extra layer of warmth to the experience.

And then there were the massages by Sophie and Eva—absolute bliss. Their skilled hands seemed to know exactly what my body needed. 

One of the highlights of my stay was undoubtedly the food. Every meal was a culinary adventure, showcasing the vibrant flavours prepared with fresh, locally sourced ingredients.

Our host, Annalisa, exuded passion in every interaction, ensuring I felt cared for throughout my stay at Ulpotha. Additionally, what truly distinguishes Ulpotha is the genuine warmth of its villagers. Their heartfelt smiles and eagerness to assist created a uniquely special atmosphere.

I stayed there for two nights and that was my first trip to Jaffna also it was one of the best stays I’ve had.

 Even before I reached Jaffna, their amazing staff Mr.Wijekumara, Rajiwvan and Pradeepsan arranged things for me based on my requirement considering those as their own requirements. 
Also provided relevant information about how to reach to the hotel after I got off from Yaldeevi.

Yes, they welcomed me with a warm welcome and made my stay comfortable with their excellent hospitality.

Also, I had one of the best and the delicious vegetarian Jaffna food there at Heritage Jaffna.

Comfortable room, great room service, calm environment, friendly staff, the explanations they provide you about the ancient city Jaffna definitely makes you feel like you are having another home in Jaffna.

Once again many thanks to Mr. Rajiwvan and Mr. Pradeepsan for making my trip memorable, comfortable and amazing. So why not, I would definitely visit you guys once again!!

Ulpotha was perfect!  Every day, I said to my friend ""I am so happy!"".  Ulpotha is a beautiful jungle oasis.   I've been to many yoga retreats around the world, and Ulpotha is the best - bar none.   The accommodations are in open huts, so you are able to see the scenery and be at one with the environment.  How lucky were we that we had elephants walk by our hut at 4am?  The villagers keep an eye on the huts, so we felt safe and protected.  Every night, our beds were turned down and our mosquito nets put in place.  We were delivered hot water bottles in the evening to warm up our beds after the rainstorms.  Very thoughtful.   :-)

The food was fabulous!  Traditional Sri Lankan vegetarian meals set up buffet style on a bamboo mat floor.   Every lunch and dinner had a new unique dish introduced to add to the vast selection of dishes.  You will not go hungry. 

The yoga was top notch!  We were graced with the lovely Samanta Duggal from Mumbai.  Samanta is an exceptional teacher of yoga and breath work.  Every class was unique.  The morning classes - she offered the foundation to Hatha Yoga - continuously providing the building blocks to a successful Hatha practice.  The evening classes were a mixture of Yin, Restorative, Yoga Nidra and Chanting.  She is such a talented instructor - she brought tears to my eyes and I've been a practioner of yoga for 20 years. 

The Ayurveda treatments were beautiful.  The offering of traditional Ayurvedic treatments in local villages have been declining over the years.  Ulpotha is helping keep the village Ayurvedic practices alive by offering several packages to purchase.   You will receive a traditional treatment by local villagers using methods of their ancestors.  We booked a 3-day Happiness treatment, and it was perfect.  I believe you can book up to 10 days of treatments if you wish.  Highly recommend - Do it!

If you find your way to Sri Lanka   - visit Ulpotha.  It will be transformational.  Trust me.

Located far from the humdrum of the modern world, it offers eveything one's body and soul require to recover and find wellbeing. From the wonderful waters of the 'wewa', to the organic food grown on the farms, to the various offerings of yoga and ayurveda, each of the elements will bring one back to balance. Cut off from electricity, gadgetry, and distraction, one's body will find it's innate rhythm again. The only noise is of wildlife, the only sights whatever nature deigns to offer, which can sometimes, to everyone's delight, turn out to be wild elephants. 

I found my sleeping patterns resolved themselves after a mere two nights, and my systems found calm and rejuvenation in just 'being'. Oftentimes, the most satisfying pastime was to go on walkabout, connecting to the land and letting go of all projections I had for life. And then, of course, to paddle along the lake, for is there anything more liberating than lying in the middle of a body of water, staring up at the vast, endless sky, whilst mountains enclose one in the safety of one's own paradise? 

The people of Ulpotha, a true empowered community, are clearly the beating heart of the place. Without them, their friendliness, and their gentleness, the place wouldn't be as half as successful.

Unlike its main man, Peter Thorpe, I’m neither a disillusioned investment banker nor was I in search of an estranged lover, after a one night stand. In fact, I’ve had my feet firmly on the ground to know that no retreat would be a niche for nirvana seekers, in the third world, never a quick dose of euphoria to escape midlife crisis, nor  even an antidote for my lingering inter-covid-wave depression. 
But I have always been fascinated by their spiritual quest, peace and bliss pursuers of Findhorn, the dream retreat of new age bon-bons: the bourgeoise bohemians whose life stops at the edge of Scottish highland wilderness. My emaciated, graduate student wallet deterred me from being part of the Findhorn family back then, in mid 90s. Yet, I’ve always been on the look out for something akin, for I’m convinced that my mortal coil deserves such rejuvenation. 
Thanks to a dear friend of mine’s proposal, I jumped at the idea of taking refuge at Ulpotha. Its eponymous name alone made me feel giddy with excitement, when contemplating the escape - whilst I felt trapped in my usual, all-devouringly white, tundric landscape during a Nordic winter. ‘Ulpotha’, its sonorous ring made me wonder what its distinct source is. No sooner did I land in Sri Lanka, than I left for Ulpotha. A ripe banana colour clad, nondescript man greeted us as we descended from the jeep, after a four hour drive from Colombo. Yet his very insouciant look, elevated by his sartorial simplicity made me a captive audience. Above all, his sedate tone of enunciations when greeting you, with his whole being devoted to you made me question whether he was trained at the Wharton school of U Pen. No, Sundar Pichai of Google never learnt any such benign communicative skills. Viren, whose name I learnt later, is the founder of Ulpotha. He took personal interest in every guest and ushered them into much ease,  not just with the  trivial banter but sharing the local lore, showing them around and above all, making all of us, jet-lagged or otherwise feeling battered, feel at home. 
Coming from little sunlight to the powerful evocation of the glowing sun over the verdant fields of Ulpotha was life-giving. William Turner back in early 19th century would have been in awe, in capturing the blurred effects of dissolution and transcendence.  I was immediately convinced that I needn’t feel guilty for not signing up for the yoga programme. True, it held the juju. Yet, all what I wanted was to totally submit to this ethereal place where I could do nothing: sit idly, hug a tree, skirt around the body of water, known as the tank, for sure, built by the ancient Anuradhapura Kingdom kings. I had no agenda. Five days of immersing with people wearing their natural smiles, instead of shielding their faces with masks, like everywhere else in mid Dec in Covid-riddled Lanka, enjoying the healthiest array of dishes among a host of like-minded souls, and above all, spending long hours with precious of friends mine whom I missed for two years were all the prerequisites of a heavenly stay. 

From the very first minute, I felt a sense of affinity. Remember the feeling of going to your grandparents’ place which you loved as a kid, and now when returning, nostalgia of love, joy and warmth they shoved you with would rush back in waves. I shouldn’t hesitate to say that’s how I felt. . Ulpotha shook me to the core. There were times I could scream of joy And I did! Since I was one of the very few who could commune in Sinhalese with the staff, I took every opportunity to hear their story and share mine. What was mind blowing was that all the ones I spoke with exhibited a sense of pride in being a part of Ulpotha. They were not mere employees. Their commitment was a labour of love. No, none of the grand tourist resort personnel’s attention to detail can hold a candle to the pervasive modesty and sincerity the Ulpotha staff discharged their duties with. 
I knew I would have to defend to a few unreflective souls when I returned to Colombo, about what I did for five days, for I was missing in action, left out in the sticks, sans electricity, sans attached bathroom and sans anything which would bring staples of joy, according to their books. I felt elated with the challenge. It’s the very presence of the absence of the aforementioned amenities which made me feel liberated. 
Hermit am I not, let alone a vegan. In fact, I love food. I travel the world to eat. Here’s the rub. Ulpotha doesn’t demand you to renounce anything. The lunches, the mega meal of the day - served in the open air pavilion painted in orange as if it were a mandir in Uttarakhand, set in breath takingly, conspiring with the maturing sun seeping through the thick foliage  - lulled you to spend much time you want, eating as slowly as you want by yourself, ensconced in a corner-meditating over every morsel you savoured, or howling with friends in frenzy  you have met over the previous meal.  I felt gripped by a sense of ineffable joy. 
The communal spirit Ulpotha offered was nonpareil. The Snack shack which fed us in the morning with nutrients like fresh kola kanda, green decoctions and locally churned, rustic, organic grub to get the day started was a perfect place to strike a conversation over a glass of king coconut. I was so sad to learn that the shack offered snacks between meals as well, something I missed out because I was so engrossed in my walks and talks. Anyone who may wonder why I spent a good chunk of holiday here at Ulpotha, instead of shacking up with the sun n sand sheiks in a soulless sun resort, I decided to recite Keats’ ‘Endymion’: 
‘A [place] of beauty is a joy forever: 
Its loveliness increases: It will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health and quiet breathing’   1818","Ulpotha: 'A thing of beauty is a joy forever'","2021-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r828022290-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

Arriving in the dark, I was carefully guided to my mud hut through the jungle. Waking up to Nature's bird songs, sounds of running river and wildlife of the lush jungle everyday is so lovely. Every corner of Ulpotha is an art, even the toilet (a place for letting go) and the outdoor showers here are uniquely and individually crafted into the surroundings. Very well thought furnishings that blend very well into the theme such as claypot dustbin, brass basins and taps, wooden table, wooden flush knob and toilet seat, partly roofed and partly open sky uniting the inner and outer worlds. Greeted by freshly decorated flower mandalas around the main house and Ambalama were also my favorite. The vegetarian cuisine here is mindfully created healthy slow food. Love the fact that our food is organically grown from the gardens, prepared with traditional ways like stone mortars and hand grinders, cooked with fire and served in claypots and coconut spoons. Around 15 different dishes are prepared in every meal, making our plates so colorful and so pleasing for the eyes. My body feels so nourished by the freshness of the food. Sometimes it's even hard to believe there's no fridge at sight in the kitchen. Everyone that comes on the retreat bonds so quickly and intimately like a family. The founder Viren is such a people person and a great character. It was a pleasure to meet him. We have daily yoga classes in the yoga Shala and outdoors nature. There are Ayurveda treatments and various therapy to go to. We also have fun time swimming in the lake where the locals also take their bath at. Easy trails for walking and exploring. Nighttime in kerosene lamps, off the grid from the digital world, Ulpotha is a fairy land for fireflies and million stars, making the whole place more so romantic. We had a great Friday night party with local music and everyone danced into the night. There's really so much to talk about at Ulpotha but you have to come and experience it yourself.

It was amazing, as always. Although we like to explore the world and discover new places it has been our third time there. Because this place is truly unique.

You immerse yourself in pure nature. Nestled in an amazing stretch of land, the village is surrounded by impressive rock formations, jungle and lakes.

It was 14 days of doing my favorite things: 
Spending time with my missus, practicing yoga, swimming in a lake (absolutely crocodile-proof), watching nature (monkeys, birds, giant squirrels, …) while relaxing in the sun.

And eat! The food is amazing. Mostly plant based and healthy as far as I can tell. With fruits and vegetables you’ve never tasted before. Everyday there’s something new to explore for your taste buds. 

The yoga was outstanding. With great teachers and two classes per day I made real progress within our two weeks stay. The massages do an amazing job in supporting these yoga efforts so that you always feel relaxed and never tense.

Beyond all those things it’s the people who make the difference. The communal aspect of the experience is very special. We enjoyed sharing the time with our co-guests. Always fascinating to meet people with different backgrounds you would have never crossed ways with otherwise. Same with the fine people of the village who took great care of us. As always, they were happy to share their culture with the guests. Like cooking over fire, harvesting rice or their harvest ceremony. 
Thanks to their effort and the management of the resort things run smoothly although you’re in the middle of nowhere.

The only thing I can’t really speak to is the Ayurvedic treatment because I never did it. Just not up my alley. But we’ve heard many guests talking highly about the treatment.

Even without Ayurveda treatment Ulpotha is perfect for detoxing of any kind - electronics, smoking, stress, unhealthy food. 
So, as much as we want to find new places on this big planet I’m afraid to say that we’ll most likely be back in Ulpotha soon. Can’t wait.","A unique place - no, really.","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g15192343-d598155-r751406485-Ulpotha_Yoga_Retreat_And_Ayurveda_Resort-Ulpotha_Village_North_Western_Province.html",

We arrived early at 5:00 AM, and Vijay
 graciously accommodated our early check-in. To our delight, they also offered us a complimentary breakfast that morning, setting a warm tone for our stay.

The hotel’s colonial-style interiors are impeccably maintained, reflecting a blend of tradition and comfort. Our room was spotless, and the premises, including the pool which is cleaned daily, exuded tranquility. The upstairs open veranda was a favorite spot of ours, perfect for stargazing and unwinding after a day of exploration.

Breakfast was a culinary delight, introducing us to the rich flavors of Jaffna cuisine. The hotel’s location is also ideal, being in close proximity to landmarks like the Jaffna Library, Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil, and the Jaffna Fort.

The property perfectly matches the photos posted on all booking websites—no surprises or disappointments. It is conveniently located in the center of Jaffna, making it easy to arrange rides via the PickMe app. It’s also within walking distance of the Nallur Temple, which was very convenient.

The WiFi was excellent, fast, and reliable throughout our stay. The food was strictly vegetarian but absolutely delicious, with plenty of choices. Though we didn’t get a chance to swim, the pool looked very inviting. The place is beautifully decorated, and I would give five stars for cleanliness.

I have come away feeling calmer, stronger, happier and deeply grateful for the experience. I also feel so much better equipped to deal with the madness of the world we currently inhabit.
 Living so close to nature and the removal from the modern world can take a bit of getting used to for some people but it is the best thing for the soul. Sit back, relax and let Ulpotha work her magic.

The villagers insisted on visiting me daily - even though it is a 2-hour drive one-way - bringing me healthy Ulpotha food, clean linen, moral support and also helping me to navigate the intricacies of the Sri Lankan hospital bureaucracy.  They did this even when I said it is not necessary.  This is just what they do!

Ulpotha offers a real, jungle experience, enabling a digital detox of the best kind. The traditional hut-style accommodation is basic and without electricity, however, each hut is beautifully designed and serviced daily. The cold water, outdoor showers hidden from view in inventive constructions within rock crevices, are both liberating and invigorating. It's amazing how quickly it's possible to adjust to needing very little and embracing this opportunity to simpy 'be' in this jungle paradise. Swimming in the freshwater lake was one of the highlights, along with walking to the top of the nearby rocks to meditate and take in the panoramic views and sounds of nothing but nature. Another highlight was the opportunity to meet many fantastic people from all corners of the globe who came together to participate in the retreat and share in the Ulpotha experience–beautiful bonds and ongoing friendships were founded.

The hotel features a lovely rooftop poolside restaurant, perfect for relaxing with a drink or enjoying a peaceful dinner with a view.

The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and always ready to help—true Sri Lankan hospitality. One small area for improvement is the response time when calling the main operator (dialing 0); it sometimes took two or three calls to get through.

Breakfast was also enjoyable, offering a good variety of international and local cuisines.

I recently visited **Jaffna** with my family, including my twin kids, and we stayed at the **Jaffna Heritage Hotel**. It was a simple yet superb experience. The staff was incredibly friendly, attentive, and maintained a neat environment.  

What stood out the most was the **authentic Jaffna cuisine** they served. The food was outstanding—prepared naturally without any artificial colors or additives. They’ve done a fantastic job of preserving the **traditional Jaffna flavors**, which made every meal a delight.  

The hotel is conveniently located **very close to Nallur**, making it easy to get around. Architecturally, the hotel is beautiful, well-constructed, and showcases a prestigious design that reflects Jaffna’s heritage.  

One thing that surprised me was my mother’s reaction. She’s usually critical about food wherever we stay, but for the first time, she genuinely appreciated the **authentic food heritage** offered throughout our stay—it was truly mind-blowing for her.  

I also noticed that the hotel operates with great routine and discipline. The pool, located in the middle of the driveway, adds a refreshing touch to the overall ambiance.  

I am extremely satisfied with my stay, and without a doubt, I will choose **Jaffna Heritage Hotel** again for my next visit. I highly recommend this place to everyone—it’s truly worth the experience!

A special mention goes to Vijay and Pratheep for their exceptional service. They were quick, attentive, and ensured all my needs were met with professionalism and a smile. Their efforts truly enhanced my stay.

The breakfast buffet was enjoyable with a good selection, but I would suggest adding more variety to the dinner menu for an even better dining experience.

The rooms were equipped with all the necessary facilities, and I had a comfortable night's sleep throughout my stay.

The triple room we had was huge, lovely comfortable beds and pillows and a very powerful shower. 

The room had a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. There was a smallish pool which we did not use but looked nice. There was a good breakfast included in the price with local curries but also fruit, bread and yogurt. 

The hotel is attractive with a colonial feel and large first floor balcony. The location is good, near to the temple but a little way from the centre.

Ravindra and the housekeeping staff is also outstanding.
Only issue that we have to mention is the restaurant and the food.
No variation, and taste is unbelievably very low.
Hopefully we will come again with others to experience the quality of environment of the great Amaya lake hotel.
Belive that mentioned issues at the restaurant would be rectified at your earliest.","Experience at the Amaya Lake","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r1005175148-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",
