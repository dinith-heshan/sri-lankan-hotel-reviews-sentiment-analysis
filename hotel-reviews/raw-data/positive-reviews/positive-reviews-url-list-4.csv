The sparkling pool is always inviting and so is the rooftop terrace restaurant. A huge bonus is the fair pricing structure of the daily room rate.

The review sums it up...it's a cute colonial bungalow with a spacious garden...the room is well restored but was rather puzzled with the choice of tacky heat panels....

It's situated within a functioning tea estate though the factory is abandoned. 

There is also a view point, couldn't really find it though with the poor signage, but nevertheless had a nice short hike...

The staff was efficient and experienced. The real downside was the food. Dinner was a set menu. The chicken was so-so and the margarita pizza was burnt... The breakfast (local option chosen) was slightly better, but extremely spicy (even for us locals) and with only a few accompaniments. 

The Google map directions are accurate and road is in good condition upto the bungalow.

The rating is rounded up only because we found the place to be quite picturesque and charming....","Cute colonial bungalow","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d14902717-r996534721-Oliphant_Boutique_Villa_By_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Starting off with the receptionist Pabalu, She always had the nicest smile and attitude, welcomed us with a warm smile and showed us around the hotel. Really grateful that we met her 🥰. 

Then the gymnasium staff Kasun, took us on a tour to show us around more places , including Ayurvie where we had the opportunity to take nice photos and enjoy calm surroundings. He made sure to capture the nicest moments which we will cherish forever. He introduced us to the pottery session where we were able to make clay items. This was an experience I missed on previous times I came to Aliya but thanks to Kasun, this time we were able to enjoy a nice poetry session and also the nature room, Pala, yoga area, kumbura and many more. 

Bartender Induwara made us amazing cocktails including one that is not even on the menu but a request. He was super nice to us and delivered an exceptional service.

There are also pool area and grounds were just gorgeous. Brightly painted walls, lots of plants and art. A cool oasis on even the hottest days. 

We opted for the Sri Lankan breakfast, which was absolutely delicious with a gorgeous fruit plate, followed by string hoppers, dhal curry and much more. Since we couldn’t come close to eating it all, the staff nicely packed it up and we had it for lunch!

This was not a problem though as we were still able to spend four nights with the minor inconvenience of having to change rooms for the last night. It was extremely accommodating of the staff to allow this and it meant we could acclimatise and get organised prior to heading up to Jaffna. We are grateful to Damith, Danu and Harsha for their flexibility!

The resort is located up a quiet street about 300 metres from the frenetic beach road and so quiet however conveniently located to restaurants, cafes, taxi services, etc. Having said this the staff will organise tuk tuks and drivers for you so you can avoid the hassle of negotiating on the Main Street.

We spent the first three nights in the Red suite, which was extremely comfortable and has a fabulous bathroom and balcony overlooking the garden and front entrance so it was very quiet. 

The last night we spent in the Orange room which is on the ground floor and still a good size room with a serviceable bathroom however not as luxurious as the suite. 

The swimming pool is great and my husband managed to swim his daily 1-1.5 kms as it is not busy.

Finally, I would like to mention the delicious food and lovely staff - Damith, Harsha, Danu, Desican, Mahinda, Dilhen and everyone else whose names I have forgotten - sorry! Together you all make this boutique hotel very special and an extremely welcoming experience.

Our room/suite was very spacious with a magnificent bed with such wonderful pillows that gave us the best sleeps ever. The hotel is decorated and furnished in a quirky style which is charming. There’s also a magnificent pool to dip into when the heat from the sun is just too overwhelming! Staff were extremely friendly and polite and couldn’t do more to make us welcome and cared for. Breakfast is superb with fresh fruit, fruit juice, tea/coffee and a comprehensive choice of cooked dishes.

The Hotel is spotless and the grounds are beautifully maintained , the pool is cleaned every  day , there are comfortable sun beds with pads and towels are provided . 
The food is beautiful both a selection of traditional Sri Lankan and western dishes .
The food is freshly cooked by wonderfully confidant and skilled kitchen team . 
You can even have Sunday lunch should you wish we had it it was brilliant 
We had the Jasmine room which was well appointed with a lovely veranda overlooking the lake which is situated next to the hotel .
It was wonderful to see a beautiful  selection of parrots king fishers being our morning visitors 
Dale the owner greeted us on arrival with complimentary drinks the staff could not do enough for you . 
Dale  arranged  a fantastic trip to Ella taking in the local National Park which was wonderful seeing a host of animals in their natural environment Crocodiles Elephants  Water Buffalo Mongoose Hawks , Eagles to mention just a few .

The pool and the grounds are just beautiful, I loved the bell next to my sun bed for when I needed service… such a lovely touch.
The food was also amazing here. It was so good that I hardly ate anywhere else on this latest trip to Sri Lanka! Not only do they serve some beautiful and tasty Sri Lankan dishes but if you fancy a Shepherds Pie, a Sunday roast or other British home comforts whilst there you’re in the right place.

The hotel is owned by Dale, a lovely English guy that knows all you need to know about trips, transport and just general advice on the area… He checked in on me everyday to make sure I was ok. I’ve never felt so looked after and I will definitely be returning.

I would highly recommend Asian Jewel Hotel. The attention to detail, the attentive staff, the stunning food and beautiful grounds/views were faultless.

A special mention goes to Viraj, who consistently made our mornings by being incredibly attentive and accommodating at the adult pool after breakfast. His professionalism and genuine hospitality made a lasting impression and added so much value to our stay.

This resort has not only set a new standard for service, but it also made our time in Sri Lanka feel extra special.

Villa stay

1012966745

We spent 4 nights at Anantara Kalutara Resort in a villa with a private pool and had an absolutely amazing time! Throughout our stay we were welcomed and taken care of!  At the main entrance four lovely ladies performed a traditional dance, which made for such a warm and memorable first impression.

Our villa had a fresh fruit basket waiting for us, filled with the most delicious tropical fruits, the mini bar was stocked with refreshments and we had a tea and coffee station. The resort itself is stunning, with the river on one side and the beach with its wild waves on the other, such a unique and beautiful setting.

The resort offers a lot of activities , but we especially loved the sundown yoga and a wonderfully relaxing couples massage. The weather was pleasant the entire stay, with just a brief tropical shower that cleared up quickly and only added to the experience.

The attention to detail and the service were truly outstanding. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, welcoming, and incredibly helpful. A special thank you to Ishara Disanayaka, Assistant Guest Relations Manager, and Lashan Liyanage, Front Office Manager. Both Ishara and Lashan, in particular, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying every moment.

Even on the day of our early departure, the team kindly packed us a breakfast to go, such a thoughtful touch!

Our only regret? That we couldn’t stay longer. Sri Lanka we loved visiting your beautiful country.","Villa stay","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1012985260-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

The food was very tasty. There were many choices, and everything was fresh and nicely made. We especially enjoyed the Sri Lankan dishes.

We also enjoyed the swimming pool, beach, and the spa. It’s the perfect place to relax and enjoy nature.

If you are looking for a quiet and luxury place to stay in Sri Lanka, we highly recommend this resort. It is good for couples, families, or even solo travelers.

Its far more than what you see on camera. You have to be there in person to explore and enjoy the amazing vista of this property. I was treated like a king!!! Amazing guest services from the reception, management and restaurant. The entire staff was very well trained, courteous and displays the srilankan hospitality at its best. 
Very humble management (Nadun and Ishan), they took their time to come to me in person few times to check up on me. Restaurant staff was very nice too. Restaurant manager and Dikli who was my personal butler gave an amazing service. I was relaxed and enjoyed at its best. Don't to take a dip in Kuda Oya. Special thanks to Kalum (Pool Boy) who guided me to river and help to spot a nice location to have a nice dip! Amazing experience!

Also a special thanks to the Geeshani from the reservations team as well with the inquiries that i had with the property.

Although we booked Jetwing Kanduruketha, we were a little apprehensive initially, as the rooms were not airconditioned and since buffet was not available... However, our worries soon disappeared as we entered through the hotel gate. The hotel is build in a 50 acre land plot and is completely surrounded by trees, paddy fields, and farm lands...Rooms are basically separate Cabanas. Personal Bicycles were available next to all rooms, which we could use if required. Our room was right next to the paddy field, which was lovely... It was sooo peaceful, and quite. 
Although there was no AC in the room, it was quite cool, and there was no need for one...Although there was no buffet, the staff was willing to honour our special meal requests, even when it was not on the menu...Food was exquisite in presentation and taste. The hotel arranged a personal butler, who took us on a guided tour of the area.. 
Everyone was smiling, courteous, and helpful. 
We accidently left one of our phones in the room and noticed it half way to Colombo. When we called looking for it, the reception immediately confirmed that they  found it and was willing to courier it back to my home.. We were amazed that we got it back in Colombo in just 2 days...This shows the integrity of the staff and the genuine care for the guests...
It simply was one of the most relaxing experiences...
Thank you everyone at Jetwing Kanduruketha for making our stay a memorable one...","One of the most relaxing experiences...","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r1012706726-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

Only one negative is that it has no A/C as it is an Eco-friendly resort, but it’s manageable.

The food (Full Board) was absolutely delicious with generous portions, offering a great variety of flavours that kept every meal exciting.

The serene surroundings, lush greenery, and scenic paddy fields created a peaceful atmosphere that immediately made us feel relaxed and at home.

The eco-luxury dwellings were both spacious and beautifully designed, blending comfort with nature. Dilani and all the staff including Nadhun the General Manager, Saduni, Maheshika, Faizal and Maduwanthi were incredibly kind and attentive, always ready with a smile and eager to help in any way. Special mention to Subath and the culinary team – every meal was a delight, with fresh local ingredients and both traditional Sri Lankan and western meal options.

What made our stay even more special was getting to take part in the traditional Sinhala New Year games organized by the hotel. It was a wonderful cultural experience that the whole family enjoyed – from tug-of-war to musical chairs and other fun local traditions and treats. It was heartwarming to see guests and staff celebrating together. We also enjoyed the guided nature walk in the morning viewing many birds with the naturalist.

Jetwing Kaduruketha is more than a hotel – it’s an experience of Sri Lanka’s natural beauty and warm culture, made even better by a team that truly cares.

Its beautiful, though you have to remember that you are in the middle of a very humid location -- so things feel a little damp.  It s the reason you book it...course. There is no aircon (eco) and the fans are enough even in the 33 degree heat, however, while its lovely to hear the critters, birds and so on all night, you kind of dream of AC from time to time.  Did not have an issue with mosquitos though we did use the net in case.  Rooms come with umbrellas and torches too.   For coffee lovers, there is a Keurig..a welcome relief for my partner. Bathroom is outdoor concept, probably the only place I thought they could have done a better job cleaning out and it felt as though the toilet was leaking.  This could very well be 5 star, but that would also double the price!   Restaurant setting is lovely, you are taking care of by a ""butler"" and the food is organic, tasty and interesting.  As usual, the wine is not great (Sri Lanka).  The pool was lovely, while swimming we saw a couple of peacocks and a monitor lizard, hornbills, yellow orioles and kingfishers.

Rooms: The room is more like a villa. There are two types to choose from. Forest dwellings are situated in a wooded area near the river and gives a slight jungle vibe. Paddy field dwellings gives a more airy and sunny vibe. On our first visit couple of years back, we opted for the forest dwelling and also had a bit of a hilarious peacock encounter. Loved it's semi open washroom. This time, the place was fully booked and only the paddy field dwellings were available. It was also pouring (unusual for that time of the year) and we loved the airy vibe of the room. While I am a big fan of open showers, the fully covered washroom (it was part of the room and only semi partitioned off) was more convenient with the rain. 

I cannot recall whether there was an Ac in the room since the weather was quite cool anyway but there was definitely no TV. While we are not the type to stay in hotel rooms watching TV, the heavy rains left us with nothing much to do. So we opted for a session at the spa which turned out to be a lovely experience. But there was only one lady at the spa, so we had to take turns and wait in the library.... The spa, the library along with the reception are housed in what used to be an old ""Walauuwa"" (a term used decribe a mansion). The library had a TV but it's collection of book could use some new additions.

There is a pool right next to the restaurant. When the place is fully booked, the pool area can get a bit crowded and noisy. 

They may offer some activities but we've stayed only for one day each time and never ask. There were bikes parked at other villas but not at ours. Again didn't really bother since it was raining anyway.

The majority of staff are young and from the vicinity with a sprinkling of more seasoned staff. We went on the day of the traditional new year and the younger ones did look a bit overwhelmed having just finished Avurudu festivities in addition to maintaining a full house. But they did get back to their sunny smiling versions by the evening. Special mention must be made of the property manager who made a point to personally welcome each guest even in the caos of many check ins and check outs and who also personally manged the check in process which didn't even take 10 mts. There was also a senior server at the restaurant (unfortunately i cant recall his name) who kept constantly checking on our needs and made sure the service was perfect. 

Jetwing properties always offer a massive breakfast spread and Kaduruketha was no exception (Its not a buffet but like a 6 -7 course meal). Throughly enjoyed the breakfast. (It has become something to look forward to on our visits to Jetwing properties.) Lunch and dinner (four course set menu) were beautifully presented. Portions were large. Loved some items, others not so much. But all in all quite enjoyable. 

The Google map directions are accurate. There are two routes, one from Ella side, other from Moneragala side. Both in good condition. 5 minutes to Wellawaya town and from there you can easily get to Yala, Arugambay, Ella, Udawalawe and roads are in excellent condition for the most part.

Удобное расположение, недалеко от пляжа , но вдали от шумной улицы. Великолепный дизайн , номера очень просторные и уютные с современной мебелью и качественными матрасами, виды с балкона номера потрясающие!
На территории есть 2 великолепных бассейна.

Персонал отеля – просто находка! Они лучшие!  всегда готовы помочь с любыми вопросами, горничные поддерживают идеальную чистоту, а на ресепшене говорят на нескольких языках. Особенно впечатлило, как быстро они реагируют на любые просьбы.

Ресторан, расположенный в отеле, поражает своей изысканностью с первого взгляда. Уютный интерьер  создаёт идеальную атмосферу для  ужина . А веранда - просто идеальное место для вечернего отдыха в отеле.

Шеф-повар творит настоящие кулинарные чудеса! Особенно впечатляют блюда из морепродуктов — свежайшие и очень вкусно приготовлены. Заказывали часто креветки, блюда из тунца, белой рыбы  — это было просто божественно!
Это именно тот отель, где хочется остановиться снова. Рекомендую этот отель всем, кто ценит комфорт и качественный сервис.

Я б снова вернулась) Современный, ухоженный уютный отельчик, локация красивая, народу не много, не толпятся. Завтрак разнообразный. До моря пройтись по джунглям минут 7, и что классно - оживленная улица прямо в 2-3 минутах от отеля, а сам отель в очень тихой зоне! Персонал реагирует на просьбы, помогает при необходимости. Понятно, что не все идеально, но главное в том, что на все твои простые реагируют и идут навстречу. 

В номере убирался юный парень Dilshan, спасибо ему за чистый номер и настроение! Уже знал, что и как нам больше нравится по быту, старался сразу учитывать) ну а где не замечал, по первой просьбе все в лучшем виде) Ты нам создал очень классное уютное ощущение, пока мы там отдыхали! Спасибо за твое внимание)

Ресепшн отзывчивый, на связи всегда. Отдельное огромное спасибо от всей души юной девушке с кудрявыми волосами, я к сожалению забыла имя!(( Может потом найду и дополню отзыв! Она и на завтраках внимательна к нам была, и с местной связью сколько мы разбирались - имей ей удалось решить проблему 🙏🏼

It’s not the kind of place with dramatic views or luxury features, but the surroundings are quiet and refreshing—trees, open sky, and the kind of calm that makes you slow down without trying. It’s a good choice if you want a simple, relaxing stay away from the noise.

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and have all the basics you need. Nothing too fancy, but everything works well and feels thoughtfully put together. There’s a sense that the place is cared for, both inside and out.

What really stands out is the staff. Everyone we met was friendly, down-to-earth, and helpful without being overbearing. Whether you needed directions, tips on where to go nearby, or just a quick chat, they were always ready with a smile. It felt more like being welcomed by hosts than just checking into a hotel.

Overall, this is a great spot if you want somewhere simple, peaceful, and well-run. The setting is gentle and natural, and the people make it even better.

Highly recommend to go for a walk and explore the surrounding tea estate as well as meeting the locals. 
We would go back to Sri Lanka, just to go back to Oliphant House.","Magical experience, didn’t want to leave","2024-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d14902717-r935663077-Oliphant_Boutique_Villa_By_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

Very cleverly photographed. The house is surrounded by a lot of houses that you can't see from the pictures, it isn't set on its own as you are led to believe. 

Our room didn't have a view or access to the outside, which was a shame as we had bad weather and had to stay inside quite a bit of the time, so looking out would have been nice. We had to move the tv out of the way of the window to be able to look outside when sitting on the couch.

The rooms we’ve got-not to complain were clean and bright-with an alright view.Bathrooms and hygiene products were all set for the better.

The food and desserts are to die for! I appreciate the chefs and workers helping out setting it in an amazing layout;and the clear blue pool next to the neighboring food tables are also peaceful and clean. 

I have no words in what I feel about the rooftop balcony.Really cool and relaxing.

We were picked up from the airport (complimentary) and driven a short distance to the hotel and were greeted with smiles and efficiency. 

I’ve worked in luxury hotels in NYC for over twenty years and I am familiar with the standard operating procedures that are required to get star rating and I have to say that the staff went above and beyond meeting and anticipating expectations.

The rooms were subtle and minimal which i love and housekeeping was superb!!! The rooftop bar and food were excellent and I want to compliment the chef and everyone in food service. They are attentive, efficient and always smiling. 

The pool and close access to the beach were excellent and after 5 days of being on vacation I can’t wait to return to NYC and get back to work but I really did not want to leave.

We had an early start for a flight home and we were provided with a substantial pack-up breakfast.
The location is good for a visit to the town of Galle Fort, steeped in history. 
We also visited a turtle sanctuary where they look after injured turtles as well as hatching and releasing babies. The visit cost 2,000 LKR pp.

Its location is lovely and quiet as it’s a little outside any of the main beach resort towns. The hotel is right on the beach front so from the immaculately layed out pool area you can sea and hear the sea. The pool area is so nice with very comfortable and plentiful sunbeds and bean bags and the pool area attendant works tirelessly in making sure you are in a nice location and you are drinking plenty of cold water. The beach is stunning with beautiful sand and a huge expanse of beach to walk up and down. The sea current can be very strong so do ask the pool attendant where it’s best to swim. The rooms are really nice and well presented all with beachfront views with very comfortable beds. All the staff are so attentive and helpful they couldn’t do enough for you. The food at the hotel is simply superb. The breakfasts are excellent. The Sri Lankan omelette, egg hoppers and labneh, avo and egg all superb. There’s also a wide variety of lunch and dinner menu options from both Sri Lankan and western pallets. The tuna main and the tamarind prawns were both knockout. There’s lots of places to sit and chill out at the hotel post dinner. A wonderful hotel and I would go back in a heartbeat.

The other poignant thing to mention is, given it rained at some point everyday of our stay, the basic rooms don’t seem to have a balcony and, the ocean suites that we stayed in have an uncovered balcony, which rendered it useless in the rain. The weather was not the hotel’s fault of course, but during our 5 night stay the hotel wasn’t at full capacity until our last night, and the suites appeared to be unoccupied - it would have been nice if the manager had used his initiative & offered those rooms to make the other guests stay more enjoyable. We also wondered why the hotel wasn’t full in high season…
On the positive side, we did enjoy our stay here - the pool is nice, with plentiful sun beds & Kasun is an absolute asset to KK, making sure the guests are as comfortable as possible. He also accompanied me on the beach & showed me where to swim in relatively safe conditions, given the waves & fierce undertow. The beach is beautiful but the sand in front of the steps down has been swept away by the storms - we actually saw the difference in the 5 days, where the drop down onto the beach became less deep.
The food here is top class - they’ve clearly got an excellent chef. The restaurant is nice but, given the lack of guests didn’t have much atmosphere & our 1st night we were in there on our own! We realised other guests were eating elsewhere - there is certainly other options within easy distance, either on the main road, or Galle. Incidentally, I must mention that KK is on an extremely busy road but once inside, you don’t hear the traffic at all - mainly because the ocean drowns it out.
The other big asset here is the staff, especially Kasuntha, Prasad & Sahan - a real credit to the hotel.","More a 4* hotel","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r990856622-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

This hotel was lovely- we had ocean suite and it was beautiful. Grounds,food and staff were lovely- just what we needed. Quiet small hotel- couldn’t hear the road at the back— and I am super sensitive. 
Kasun was lovely at the pool and showing where to swim.
Beach was beautiful and quiet.
Food was decent but maybe after a few days you would want to try something different.  You could walk to town in 15min.

Great animal rescue near by- to visit;
AnimalSoS - please visit!

We would stay here again.","Lovely boutique hotel for relaxation!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r988488631-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The breakfast buffet offered a great mix of international favorites and local Sri Lankan dishes. We especially appreciated how flexible the kitchen was – they were more than happy to accommodate individual requests.
One of the highlights was a deeply relaxing massage at the spa – just what we needed to unwind.
All in all, we enjoyed a few peaceful, restorative days by the pool and at the nearby beach.","Highly Recommended","2025-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1016792098-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

Architecture:
Amaranthé Bay was built only 10 years ago, built for comfort with an American type of architectural design, similar to the Hilton or the Marriott.  Luxury and spacey, high tech but elegant.  Quality materials, the hard wood floor was a feature that I appreciated very much.  Sunlight fills the room all day long, the jacuzzi room could easily serve as a sauna.  The balcony with quality wooden chairs and table was comfortable to sit and watch the sunset plus the view of the lagoon and way over the yonder.  I loved the touch screen light control panel for all the lights throughout the 50m2 suite, the sitting room was spacious, the king size bed was comfortable, the big mirrors with surrounding led soft lights…big shower with rainforest shower head, good pressure and load of hot water.  
The towels are big and fluffy as they machined dry and not sundry, hence, it was a joy to dry myself with these towels.  I don’t mind sundry but machined dry feels like I’m at home in the states.  Amenities/toiletries were nice and handy, 2 one liter bottles of water daily more when we asked for more.  
Good housekeeping, a team of two male staff the whole time we were there.  They were very friendly, helpful and very polite.  
The ground was immaculately clean and well kept, ground keepers constantly on the move keeping the garden beautiful.  The pool guy was super friendly, helpful and thoughtful, no minute detail could escape his attention.  

Overall, the whole complex was very well designed and maintained, of course, it’s a tropical country with high humidity so there ought to be some damage to the paint but I noticed that they do their best with the up-keeping.  

Now the food was another matter entirely, there was absolutely no consistency.  One day it was fine from the buffet breakfast when there were more guests then the nest day same breakfast buffet but it was not well cooked or well prepared.   One time, the milk rice was cold and as hard as a rock.  Unbelievable!
The dishes weren’t authentic enough for us especially the level of spiciness, knowing that their dishes were prepared to serve guests that are not used to spicy dishes.  Hence, we made it clear to the kitchen staff that we wanted authentic spicy Sri Lankan dishes, it worked but as soon as there was a difference chef or not our usual server to take note then it all went back to square one again.  Well, needless to say, we were disappointed in the dishes they have in the menu.  Fixed menu when there weren’t enough guests, buffet when the hotel is busy.  

Though, we must give credit where credit is due, the management and the staff were very kind to accommodate our requests, they even took the dinner order ahead of time to make sure all was in order.  However, as soon as there was a change in staff or chef rotation, all the work went out the window.  There was a huge lack of communication, consistency and discipline.  
We enjoyed massively the accommodation but we were very disappointed in the dishes that they served.  We had high expectations before we arrived to Amaranthé Bay as we stayed at 4 Sri Lankan hotels before arriving to this lovely hotel and we had amazingly delicious and authentic cuisine until then.    We would return but will be eating elsewhere unless they made massive changes to their menu but will we risk it at the time of booking?","Beautiful Lagoon Views Amazing Spacious Room","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1015369004-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

	1.	The rooms are magnificent and all the rubbish about them being  poorly maintained is in my experience completely baseless. We had two rooms , as we wanted to stay at a higher floor , and they moved us. Both rooms were excellently maintained. 
	2.	Each room was extremely large  50 m2 and as it was a suite had both a jacuzzi and a normal shower room. 
	3.	If you’ve ever been to say Florida it reminds me a lot of say a Ritz Carlton Resort there … very Floridian vibe 
	4.	We’ve stayed this trip in much smaller boutique hotels in Sri Lanka which I probably prefer but that’s purely a personal preference 
	5.	What about the food ? Well I wasn’t that impressed at first as we booked half board directly with the hotel and I felt that the food was a bit bland as it has to cater to a very diverse audience and to be be honest we like fairly authentic hot local food. The management and the catering staff couldn’t have done any more to try to accommodate this after we let them know.  So well done to them. But I have to be honest here the restaurant completely lacks consistency. This is a last minute addition to my review and it’s a very sad comment to make . From the very first time we went to the restaurant we said we didn’t like our food bland so if we are ordering something Sri Lankan we expect it be authentically spicy. We would say that and it wouldn’t happen after a few days they got this right decent rice and curry etc. but on our last night there we ordered dishes we’d had before …both completely bland right back to square one  . I even had exactly the same dish I’d had the night before. …we had to ask for chilly to be added to both our rapidly cooling dishes after we’d tried them and the manager said the staff didn’t know we liked the food spicy as they cook everything with no spice . This is unacceptable for someone who’d eaten there 10 nights in a row. Maybe I’m being unfair but the wait staff knew ..the chefs knew as my wife spoke to them but the every time the managers in the restaurant got involved it was wrong. For a while we had the same waiter he would ensure we got what we wanted but constantly changing who it was is almost bound to lead to the inconsistency we witnessed. This is undoubtedly the biggest issue with the hotel which prevents it being what it absolutely could be. There is  no way I would chose to my eat the evening meal in the restaurant while it continues to be like this …..sorry but that is how it is. 
	6.	One other more minor thing I didn’t like but this appears to fairly consistent in Sri Lanka is the prices being quoted then plus this tax and that tax and service etc. probably fine for Americans who are used to this but most of the audience here isn’t used to that. Just tell me how much it is please ? As it’s got service than do we not tip does all that go to the staff directly ? Anyway that’s a criticism more of Sri Lanka than of the hotel  

So in conclusion would we stay there again ? Definitely..I didn’t see anywhere in Trincomalee or surrounds that looked any better or even close. I would definitely eat dinner out not because the chefs cant cook or the waiting staff cant wait but because sad to say they can’t deliver anything like consistency. 

What about Trincomalee? It’s certainly far less developed that further south. There is plenty to do. Rather surprisingly we saw two large wild elephants crossing the road just a couple of kms from the hotel when we went off to see the wild crocodiles in a lake 

I found I got much more smiles from people outside of the hotel  with the odd word or phrase in Tamil particularly the fishermen on the beach 

So back to the hotel. Staff try extremely hard to accommodate requests and were without exception extremely nice. Good examples of this include the guy at the pool who could not of worked harder running around getting towels,  cleaning the pool , keeping his eye on junior swimmers. The people who cleaned the rooms who worked extremely hard to keep the place immaculate, the gardeners who made the place so beautiful, the guy delivering the delivering the  bag who carried monster weight bags up flights of stairs. All these the small cogs in the wheel did their jobs with grace and smiles 

We stayed for 10 days so I think we got a good idea of how this place works. We also spoke to a Swiss guy and he had stayed there a month or so. No one would stay there that long at for Sri Lanka a relatively expensive place if it didn’t have high standards 

One final suggestion maybe it would be even better if it was adults only place ? Kids and a breakfast buffet is a recipe for sticky fingered disaster.","Excellent Floridian Style Resort","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1014889185-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",

Reading your kind words, it brings us great joy to know that this is exactly the experience you had during your stay at Amaranthé Bay.
Your generous appreciation of every member of our team — from the security guard to the front desk, pool attendants, and housekeeping — is incredibly meaningful. Each of them plays a unique role in creating the atmosphere we’re proud of, and your acknowledgment reminds us that the little gestures of warmth and helpfulness are what leave the biggest impact.
We’re especially pleased that you enjoyed your time in the Junior Suite. The private Jacuzzi and tranquil balcony views are designed to offer guests that perfect blend of comfort and indulgence — and we’re thrilled to hear it was well worth the upgrade for you.
And of course, your mention of the breakfast spread brought smiles to our culinary team. We strive to begin each day with a variety of flavours that blend local richness with international favourites, and it’s wonderful to know it added to your enjoyment.
Thank you once again for choosing to stay with us and for so kindly sharing your feedback. It was our pleasure to host you, and we’d love nothing more than to welcome you back whenever your journey brings you to Trincomalee again.
With All Our Gratitude, Amaranthé Bay.

We’re absolutely delighted to know your experience with us at Amaranthé Bay was one you consider the very best.
While we’re proud of our tranquil setting, elegant rooms, and thoughtful amenities, it is truly the service and care extended by our team that we hold most dear — and it’s incredibly meaningful to hear that Mayuran and Sethuraman left such a lasting impression on your stay. Exceptional service often comes down to the smallest moments of genuine attention and understanding, and we’re so pleased that both gentlemen were able to meet your needs with kindness, responsiveness, and professionalism.
Your words will mean a great deal to them — they, like the rest of our team, are passionate about creating warm, memorable experiences for every guest. Being recognized for going the extra mile is one of the greatest compliments they can receive, and your thoughtful mention will no doubt inspire them further.
It’s also a joy to know that you found the overall hospitality throughout your stay to be consistently welcoming and accommodating. Whether it’s anticipating a guest’s preferences, assisting with special arrangements, or simply being present when needed — those touches define who we are and what we strive to offer every day.
Thank you once again for your trust and generous recommendation. It would be our true pleasure to welcome you back for another stay, and we hope that the next time you visit Trincomalee, Amaranthé Bay will feel just like coming home.
With warmest regards, Amaranthé Bay.

“5 nights in paradise” is exactly what we hope every guest takes away from their time with us, and it’s truly heartwarming to know that your experience at Amaranthé Bay lived up to that sentiment.
We’re delighted that you chose to end your active Sri Lankan journey with us and even more thrilled to hear that it turned out to be the highlight of your entire trip. Knowing that you found our Junior Suite to be the best accommodation you've ever stayed in is such an incredible compliment — we’re truly humbled.
That view across the lagoon from your third-floor balcony is one of our most cherished features, and we’re so pleased that it added to the serenity of your stay, whether enjoying a quiet moment outside or unwinding in the double Jacuzzi. Creating those peaceful, picture-perfect moments is something we strive for, and we’re so happy you experienced just that.
We’re also overjoyed to hear how much you enjoyed the food at our restaurant — especially the spicy lagoon prawns! Our chefs will be thrilled to hear that their efforts made such an impression that you chose to dine with us nearly every meal. We believe every meal should be a memorable part of the stay, and your words affirm that commitment.
Of course, what touched us most is your recognition of our team. To be called the friendliest people in Sri Lanka is a compliment we carry with immense pride. Our staff work with genuine warmth and passion, and knowing you felt that makes it all the more special.
Thank you once again for your heartfelt feedback and for choosing Amaranthé Bay to end your journey on such a high note. We miss having you here already and would be absolutely thrilled to welcome you back for another unforgettable escape by the bay.
In Gratitude, Amaranthé Bay.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share such a kind and heartfelt review. Guests returning to stay with us is one of the highest compliments we could receive, and your continued trust means the world to us.
Hearing that our team remembered you from your previous visit brings us great joy — it’s those familiar faces and genuine connections that make what we do so rewarding. Hospitality for us isn’t just about service; it’s about creating a feeling of home away from home. We’re delighted that you felt that sense of warmth and recognition from the very beginning of your stay.
It’s wonderful to know that your room met your expectations once again — spacious, well-equipped, and made even better by the addition of Dialog TV. We're glad you were able to relax and enjoy some English Premier League action during your downtime — the little comforts matter, and we’re happy we could provide that familiar enjoyment during your stay.
Your comments on our breakfast buffet are truly appreciated. We aim to strike a balance between traditional Sri Lankan flavours and international favourites, and it's always great to hear that our selection met your tastes. Our culinary team will be especially pleased to know their efforts were well received.
And of course, we couldn’t agree more — the pool and its serene surroundings continue to be a highlight for many of our guests, and we're thrilled it remains your favourite spot too. Whether it’s a quiet swim, a relaxing soak in the Jacuzzi, or simply taking in the calm ambiance, we’re glad it added that extra layer of relaxation to your experience.
Michael, thank you once again for choosing Amaranthé Bay not just once, but twice. Your loyalty and kind words are sincerely appreciated, and we look forward to welcoming you again on your next visit to Trincomalee — where your favourite room, your favourite pool, and a familiar smile will be waiting for you.

The free airport transport is an excellent service. Our driver who was very professional helped us with getting sim cards at our request a real gentleman.

The service in the hotel is what you would expect in a five star city hotel, it was completely unexpected.

And the hidden gem in this hotel is the chef. OMG! The food is to die for. The best curry I've ever tasted!  Carters for gluten free. As mentioned we spent our last day at an expensive hotel but the food wasn't a patch on Belmont. So we walked in the end our trip on a high at the Belmont for a taste of the most delicious food. 

Will definitely stay at the Belmont next time and probably for a couple of day's at the end to explore Negombo. Hopefully we get the chance to return soon. ","Best curry in Sri Lanka!

Many of these bars/restaurants had live music in the evenings.
2) The Bathroom had really hot showers, which for me is crucial especially when you need to shower 2 or 3 times during the day due to hot climate/beach visit. It just makes your visit relaxing.
3) As it is a stopover hotel for tourists moving on to their next destination in Srilanka, most opt for b&b as we only saw a few people at dinner(we were on HB). Because of this, the menu was a la carte both times and options a bit limited(especially for vegetarians). However, if you want something special/different made for you, you can request it the night before and they will happily oblige. They cooked vegetarian Kottu for us which was really delicious.

It is a great area first, surrounded by greeneries and quietness, you barely hear cars, you mostly hear birds and other pleasant sounds. It comes on a hill in the Oliphant estate, many tea plantations around. 

Rooms: superb, I had 2 different rooms as I got disturbed by a family in the near by room and could not find the quietness that I came for. Lakshman changed me as soon as I have done the request but wished I wasn’t placed there at first. 
Shower with very hot water, bathroom amenities are great. The bed is out of this world, you would sleep like a baby. 

Food: full of flavors, on the first rainy day, I decided to have lunch there, was looking forward to having some authentic srilankan cuisine rather than international. The team heard me and from that instant, I have been blessed by Amazing flavors for dinner and breakfast. My regards to the chef, he is really good. 

Service: Lakshman was the man for everything, he can also speak Arabic and sometimes we would speak together in Arabic. Very pleasant never intrusive, always helpful and arranged for me a drive to the Hortain plains in the early morning, he was awake at the time I departed and made sure all arrangements are done. This man deserves a promotion. Make sure to keep him here, this place would have a different value without him. shukrane Lakshman. 
All other personnel are nice too, always with a big smile, Buddhika was one of them. 

I regretfully leave this place but I am sure, if I am ever back to nuwara eliya, this is where I will be.","Splendid place with great service","2023-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d14902717-r880143021-Oliphant_Boutique_Villa_By_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

We stayed for 3 nights. The setting is tranquil and high up in the tea plantations. From the moment we arrived Lakshman and his team gave us the warmest welcome and gave us the highest level of service throughout our stay. He and his team could not do enough for us- including ironing some very crumpled clothing! Spacious rooms with the most comfortable beds and silky soft bedding. The food was superb and credit must go to the fantastic chef who prepared Michelin star quality food and was able to cater for our dietary requirements. Dinner was a 4 course meal.  Every course was tasty and beautifully presented. Breakfast included home baked rolls and pastries all of which were delicious. It is cooler here so the crackling fire was really appreciated. A Packed breafast was arranged for our hike in Horton Plains which was really appreciated. If you want luxury, somewhere peaceful with the best food and service this is the place to be.

The Oliphant team (comprised of Mr Sanjeena, Arosha, Chaminda and the talented Chef Roshan) immediately made us feel at home, supplying us with refreshments and showing us around a generously appointed room (where we enjoyed several nights of deep, uninterrupted sleep). 

With our travel fatigue and soreness washed from our system by several litres of tea grown on the Oliphant plantation), the hotel team were quick to set us up with a tuktuk driver (a big shout out to Kumar for driving us through rain and shine) and to provide us with helpful advice on how to explore our surroundings.

First the service, what can I say, it was just exceptional, thank you Malith, Dino, Rohan, Asanka, Sandy, gardeners and security (including Fred and Wilma the friendly but vigilant golden retriever security team!) for making our stay the most relaxing and enjoyable I've ever had (and we have travelled all over the world). Special mention to Sandy for showing me the baby fish and trying :) to teach me the Sinhalese names of the birds, our mutual love of wildlife meant the language difference wasn't a barrier 🙏. The property and gardens are beautiful, 'Raj' in style, spotlessly clean (thanks Rohan and your team), comfortable. Asanka you are a top chef, your dishes prepared and presented would not be out of place in the best hotels. Dino, you are a gem, your attentive service was just exceptional and we enjoyed our many chats and your stories, you made us feel part of the Reef Villa family. Lastly location, it feels off the beaten track, the grounds and rooms are very quiet, with direct access to the beach from the garden and pool on one side and the railway line and quiet access road on the other. It's only 10minutes quiet amble to the railway station, bustling little market (2 banks and grocery stores). It's undeniably poor by western, but I was only pestered three times, it's generally super friendly and the place is not as littered as many places in India. I spent a couple hours every morning just wandering around with my camera. Be respectful and ask if people mind their photo taken and you're usually rewarded with a genuine smile and occasionally a slightly bemused expression (as I'm sure I would give in the same situation). We took the commuter train along the coast, that was an experience not to be missed. Finally I'd go back tomorrow if I could, it was a beautiful, unique boutique, relaxing 2 weeks with lovely people on the Pearl of the Indian Ocean.","A little bit of Heaven in Paradise","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r1007851168-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

What we weren’t prepared for was that we had the whole place to ourselves! At first this was a little uncomfortable to grasp but then it hit us - you have an amazing villa with your own private chef & staff to look after you. & boy did they. Dino was amazing, always on hand to ask if we wanted a drink by the pool, occasionally bringing us a lovely sorbet & always with a smile & great stories.
We had the lily pond room which was lovely. All rooms look lovely especially the 2 suites in the main house. The house is full of lovely antiques but has a very contemporary feel with the main staircase.
The pool is large & welcoming in the heat of the day. The beach is lovely but after storms is strewn with plastic rubbish. There isn’t much around that tempted us but we were happy just to soak up our surroundings.
The food was amazing. Breakfast very substantial. We are not lunch people but had dinner in the restaurant each night. Whilst there isn’t a big choice we did ask for something off the lunch menu for dinner on our last night & this wasn’t a problem. The curries were amazing & you could probably share one. Yes the prices are high, the highest we paid in the whole of our holiday but the fact that we were the only guests made it worthwhile & very special.
In summary this is an amazing place to spend a couple of nights at the beginning or end of your Sri Lankan trip. Whilst we loved the fact we were the only ones there, this place needs guests to survive & my recommendation would be just go, you won’t be disappointed.","Relaxing hidden gem","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r1003309763-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

Also very much appreciated was the large shady verandah and watching the fish in the extended pool running alongside it. 

Best of all was the care given to us by the staff. Thanks to Malith the manager, who was always ready to help with a smile. Dino in charge of the restaurant was there to give any further assistance, ably supported at tables. by the friendly and energetic Malin.

The gardens and pool are beautiful and again very well maintained. Watching the wildlife has been entertaining too. We have also enjoyed a game or two of table tennis.

Given the pandemic that has effected the world over the last two years, we were delighted to find that the owners had been able to retain the services of many of the established staff with the General Manager, Chef, Head waiter, Head of Housekeeping all being familiar faces and helped make our holiday very enjoyable.   The Island generally was still taking precautions against the virus and the controls that the Hotel exercised made us feel very safe and enabled us to stay relaxed during our stay.   All our requirements were attended to without any fuss, including the search for a battery charger, which we had inadvertently left at home!
There is a wide selection of food available throughout the day which is all prepared and cooked fresh, making the most of the exceptional quality of produce available on the island.    We spoke to the chef and he was able to prepare our food just as we requested.   The service throughout our stay was exceptional,  we are so pleased that we had decided to return and are already planning another trip to Sri Lanka in a couple of years time and undoubtedly we will return to the Reef.
If you are seeking a relaxing location with excellent service and quality produce, we can throughly recommend a stay at the Reef.  Considering the anxiety that has been experienced over the last two years, we had been concerned at how the pandemic might have effected Reef Villa, but we need not have worried.  The quality remains and will improve further as the Island reopens.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share such a detailed and thoughtful review of your stay at Sun Siyam Pasikudah.

We're thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the vibrant yet relaxing atmosphere, from our spacious rooms and 10/10 pool to the perfectly cooked tuna steak and attentive poolside service.

We always aim to go that extra mile, and it's incredibly rewarding to see those efforts appreciated.

We also appreciate your honest feedback regarding the beach conditions inside the reef. You're absolutely right—it’s ideal for families with young children, while the outer reef does offer some fantastic snorkeling opportunities. Rest assured, your comments help us continue refining the guest experience.

It was a pleasure having you with us, and we hope to welcome you back soon for another sun-soaked, beer-filled, and beautifully relaxing escape.

First place we’ve been to where they have proper pool drink service.  I never had a drink get under 20% without being asked for another one en route.  And major props to leaving the AC on when the room was unattended.  LOVED THAT!  If I had one complaint it would be that the beach inside the reef isn’t great for swimming - super shallow.  Good for little kids if you’re worried about strong currents or large waves.  Outside the reef is great snorkeling.  But that being said the pool is fabulous and the beach front is groomed immaculately.  Had the Tuna Steak every night and they got the temp spot on every time and drank a million beers by the pool.  Great spot to relax and chill in the sun.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your heartfelt feedback following your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana.
We are truly delighted to hear that your experience, though brief, left such a lasting impression. It brings us great joy to know that the natural setting, the serene surroundings, and the unique design of our dwellings created a “heavenly” escape for you.

I am also happy to hear that Lakshan provided warm and attentive service, as did the rest of our team. We are grateful that you noticed the many thoughtful touches, such as the complimentary minibar and the peaceful forest paths that wind through our property.
However, I would also like to sincerely apologize for the discrepancy regarding the Bose Home Entertainment system. Your observation is noted, and we will ensure that the details presented on our website are updated to reflect the current in-room facilities, so expectations are always aligned.

Thank you once again for your glowing recommendation. We would be honoured to welcome you back for a longer stay in the future — so you can continue to enjoy the tranquil beauty and personalized care that define Jetwing Vil Uyana.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for your wonderful review and for choosing to stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. It’s a true pleasure to read that your experience with us was filled with memorable moments — from the magical wildlife encounters to the peaceful jungle setting of our unique dwellings. We’re especially glad that you enjoyed the sense of space and privacy across the property, along with the special touches we’ve curated to enhance every guest’s stay.

Your kind words about the food, especially our breakfast offerings, are greatly appreciated. I'm also pleased to know our team was able to accommodate your early start and still welcome you back with a warm breakfast — a small gesture that means a lot to us. Thank you as well for highlighting Thusara’s attentive service. He, along with the rest of our team, is truly passionate about creating memorable and personalized experiences for our guests, and I will certainly share your compliments with him. We're glad you made the most of our central location to explore the wonders of the Cultural Triangle, and that thoughtful touches like sarongs for temple visits and welcome snacks made your stay even more enjoyable.

It was our pleasure to host you, and we truly appreciate your high recommendation. We hope to welcome you back again soon for another unforgettable experience in our little sanctuary.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

The lovely rooms are dotted around the site so you don't feel hemmed in and we loved being surrounded by wildlife. Monkeys running around was magical and an elephant walking through the hotel grounds was a first! We didn't see the resident croc but were lucky enough to see the loris on the night walk. (recommend booking this as it gets busy)
The food was excellent and we were particularly impressed with the choice at breakfast. We had a really early start one morning but they sent us off with some pastries and still welcomed us for breakfast on our return. 
The staff are amazing, particularly Thusara who looked after us throughout. We also loved the little touches like offering a small plate of snacks on arrival and  with evening drinks and putting sarongs in the bedrooms for the temples.

Thank you for sharing your kind feedback following your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. We are delighted to hear that your time with us in Sigiriya was both serene and memorable. Our unique setting — nestled amidst lush paddy fields, wetlands, and waterways — is truly one of our greatest treasures, and we’re so pleased it added to the charm of your experience.

It’s heartening to know that your dwelling, offered the comfort and tranquility you were looking for. I’m especially glad to hear that Ravi provided attentive and personalized service throughout your stay. We are equally proud of our resident naturalist, Yesitha, whose deep knowledge and passion for wildlife help create unforgettable experiences — such as spotting the elusive slender loris! Thank you also for recognizing the collective efforts of our front desk, housekeeping, and restaurant teams. Your kind words mean a great deal to all of us and serve as a wonderful motivation.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing such a thoughtful and heartfelt review. It brings me immense joy to know that your two‑day retreat in our Paddy Dwelling with plunge pool provided the peace, luxury, and immersion in nature that we strive to create for every guest. I am delighted that our personal butler service and the attentive care of our team contributed to your comfort and tranquility. Your kind words about our staff’s warmth and readiness to assist will be shared with them—they will be deeply encouraged by your feedback.

I’m also pleased you enjoyed the Loris Trail with our naturalist, even though the elusive lorises remained hidden on that occasion. Our conservation efforts are very dear to us, and we’re happy the insights shared brought you closer to appreciating these remarkable creatures and our ongoing initiatives. Our eco‑friendly design, inspired by traditional Sri Lankan architecture, aims to blend seamlessly with the surrounding wetlands, paddy fields, and forest canopy. It is wonderful to hear that the harmony of nature and culture resonated with you and enhanced your luxury experience.

While two days provided a snapshot of our sanctuary, we wholeheartedly agree that Jetwing Vil Uyana truly shines over a week—or more—allowing time to savour every moment, explore our botanical and wildlife trails, and indulge in our holistic wellness offerings.
We look forward to welcoming you back for an extended stay so you can continue your journey of peace, beauty, and eco‑luxury with us. Please let us know when you wish to return, and we will be honored to plan another unforgettable experience for you.

But they have a heated outside pool!..... a gym, a spa, a large room with a pool table and a sizeable garden if you want to hang outside the room. Their gardener also told us proudly that they've been continously winning prizes for the best flower garden during the Apirl season. 

The service was exemplary! Everyone from the Manager to the staff was, friendly, very attentive and very efficient. The food was really good. The portions were quite large and the service was one of the fastest I've seen.

And of course in the middle of all this I decided to fall sick ;) and the staff went above and beyond to help us.

Everything from the setting to the service was truly exceptional.

We spent the first three days in the beautiful upstairs villa with a breathtaking paddy view — the peaceful atmosphere and lush surroundings made it a perfect escape into nature. On our last day, we moved to the plunge pool room, which was the ideal way to end our trip with some extra relaxation and privacy.

A huge thank to Harith, Sameera, Shantha, Sanjeewa, Ashen, Thiwanka and the Chef— each of you made our stay feel so special. The service was warm, attentive, and always with a smile. The food was consistently delicious and beautifully presented — compliments to the chef!

Food - The food was exceptional each time we ate - whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. It was definitely 5*. The staff are so attentive and genuinely want you to have the best experience. 

Facilities - The pool is lovely and very spacious so you can relax there in between safaris. There is a small modern gym which does the job and you can also use the sauna and steam room free of charge at any time which is a great touch!

Experience - It is an exciting experience to stay inside a national wildlife park and there are buggy’s to take you around at night to ensure you are safe. The hotel is so clean and modern it makes you feel really comfortable.

Room - potentially the best room we have ever stayed in! We were upgraded to a pool suite for our honeymoon which was just exceptional. Every little detail has been thought about in the room - whether this be them providing bath salts or a Japanese toilet, it truly was incredible!

visited Hilton Yala Resort in June 2025 to celebrate our anniversary, and we chose the hotel after much hesitation, to be honest, as we didn’t know what to expect from a resort in the middle of a national park. Little did we know; we enjoyed our stay, got the much-needed relaxation, and also got reenergized!

We drove around 4 hours from Katunayake to get there, and it was a smooth ride except for the very last path leading to the hotel. Since it’s a part of the Yala National Park, it was a sandy, rough ride, so please anticipate bumps on that path.
We arrived around 11 a.m., and the staff was really courteous to arrange an early check-in for us. At the lobby, you’ll be welcomed with a nice, refreshing herbal tea and to say how much we fell in love with that drink: we literally had it with every meal!! (Ask for it, and they are more than happy to accommodate that request for you if it's available.)

You will be given a safety briefing at the lobby while you wait. Believe us when we say this, please pay attention to your ranger and get all your doubts sorted out, since you are dealing with raw wildlife, and it is as real as it gets.

Room and amenities – I think the pictures speak for themselves! We spent two nights at their Premium Pool Villa, which is a spacious, modernly furnished room with roller curtains, so whenever you need, you can have that dramatic panoramic view of outside. The room comes with all the basic amenities, and the most fascinating one was their automated commode, such a fancy addition, LOL! The plunge pool was considerably a long one, so during decent hours, you can have a small swim and enjoy by the plunge pool. But keep in mind, you cannot take any food outside of your room, so please adhere to that to avoid any monkey or wildlife attacks. However, you can order anything from the bar menu when you are at the main pool, which is really spacious and picturesque.

Food and beverages – this we can go on and on about for ages. We loved every plate they served us. Let’s start with the first day's lunch. We were starving, so the portion size of the first meal didn’t sit right with us. So to compensate, our server Vishmi offered us a second dessert. We ordered Peri Peri prawns and chicken wings as appetizers, Sri Lankan platter and seafood spaghetti as mains, and two desserts and three scoops of ice cream.
The specialty about their ice creams is they come in various different flavours you probably haven’t tried ever. So if you want an extra scoop or something, don’t hesitate to ask your server for the day.
Special mention should go to Vishmi and all other servers who served us, because they coordinated nicely with the chefs to make sure all our requests were fulfilled.
Chef Jerome at Hilton Yala is usually a name that comes up when we read the reviews and watched some YouTube videos about the hotel, but he was not there during our stay. Still, his sous-chef did a great job with the taste and quality of the food. Every dish they served us on both nights was top-notch, and the portion size was just right during dinner.
Go for the prawns or seafood always, as we found that their seafood is comparatively much fresher than their chicken.
The other highlight was the fresh energizer drinks they serve at breakfast. We ordered all four at once, and the soursop (anoda) energizer was just a super addition to our breakfast. Also, they serve prawns and poached eggs on toast (we don’t remember the name exactly), but it is a main that you must try.
We have this policy not to try the same thing twice when going for set menus, but we couldn’t resist ordering it again for the second breakfast.

Staff and hospitality – everyone in the staff will greet you with abundant smiles, and you will never get bored of it. They are very courteous and try their best to make your visit so memorable. Vishmi, who was our server, should get special recognition for tolerating our shenanigans. And it was nice to see Mr. Vino and Ms. Gitanjali again.

Things to do around the hotel – They are equipped with a considerable gym and have spa and sauna facilities as well. You can plan a trekking trip with rangers, as well as a safari to the national park.
When we were visiting, they had organized a beach cleaning day, which we participated in. But if you are staying only for a night, you might not want to spend time away from the resort.
We did a safari after we checked out from the hotel, and they were more than happy to keep our luggage in the luggage room until we got back.

So that’s about it from our visit, and we highly recommend this place to anyone. And if you are having reservations like we did; keep the doubts aside, because we can assure you a well-relaxed and enjoyable stay at Hilton Yala.","Serenity in the middle of a national park","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1016328350-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Accommodation;
Stayed in a premium chalet with a large plunge pool, a real highlight for our daughters.
Chalets are luxurious and well-equipped with all 5-star amenities.
Some thoughtful restrictions, like no in-room dining, to prevent attracting wildlife, which we completely understood and appreciated.

Wildlife & Experiences;
Dedicated wildlife spotters on-site, ensuring guest safety and providing real-time wildlife updates.
Private Yala safari with Ranger Bhanuka was exceptional. Spotting elephants and a pack of 2 leopards among all other tropical wildlife was a real adventure. 
Evening beach walk with guides was magical, we watched three wild elephants stroll the beach nearby.
Mesmerising sunrise over the ocean was unforgettable.

Facilities;
Large resort pool with multiple cabanas, perfect for family relaxation.
Spa treatments were beautifully done and deeply relaxing.
Gym is adequately equipped. 
Plenty of buggies with drivers to transfer guests within the resort without for comfort and safety. 

Dining; 
The culinary experience was a standout.
Chef Jerome is an absolute magician, his food was exceptional, and he personally connected with guests, often creating special off-menu dishes.
The quality, variety, and attention to detail in every meal were outstanding.

Service;
Every staff member, from check-in to check-out, was genuinely warm, attentive, and went above and beyond to make our stay special.
Special thanks to Nayana for his thoughtful service throughout.
Deep gratitude to General Manager Gitanjali for her personal assistance and securing upgrades that made our stay even more memorable.

Hilton Yala is not just a resort, it’s a full wildlife and luxury experience combined. The seamless balance of comfort, adventure, safety, and genuine hospitality makes this one of the most memorable stays we’ve ever had. We’ve stayed in many luxury properties globally, but this one truly stands out.

Highly recommended, and we would return anytime when visiting Sri Lanka.","Hilton Yala Resort – A Truly Phenomenal Experience","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1016171053-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The quality of food deserves special mention: it felt like dining at a Michelin-star restaurant. Every item on the menu was thoughtfully prepared and absolutely worth trying.

The service at the hotel is impeccable. Every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, helpful, and genuinely passionate about making our stay unforgettable.

A special thanks goes to our ranger, Rimesh. He’s a walking encyclopedia—deeply knowledgeable about Sri Lanka’s wildlife, birds, and nature. We joined him on three safaris, and each time was a unique and educational experience. The hotel is incredibly lucky to have him, and I highly recommend requesting him for your safari experience—he’s not just a guide, but a truly remarkable person.

I’d also like to acknowledge our safari jeep driver, Sithulpawwa. He’s the best safari driver I’ve encountered—thanks to his skills and instincts, we spotted every type of animal and were always among the first to reach key locations.

Thank you so much for sharing such a vivid and beautifully written account of your stay with us at Hilton Yala. It was truly a pleasure to read, and I know our entire team will be delighted by your kind words.

We’re thrilled that your time with us left such an impression—from the moment of arrival to every thoughtful interaction thereafter. Your appreciation for the small details, from the cold towels to the birdsong and even the technology in your room, speaks volumes about your eye for meaningful experiences.

Room 306 sounds like it was the perfect base for your Yala adventure! We’re glad it offered you both comfort and inspiration, and your tip on the Merlin bird app will surely inspire other guests to engage with the natural surroundings just as you did.

Your kind recognition of Gitanjali’s leadership and the passion of team members like Sajith, Jerome, and Bodika truly means a lot. Their dedication to creating personalized, immersive moments for our guests is at the very heart of what we do. I will personally ensure your feedback is shared with them—they’ll be honored to know they helped shape your experience so memorably.

The anecdotes you shared, from monkeys making a surprise visit to the custom Indian banquet, add such rich texture to your story—and are exactly the kind of memories we hope every guest leaves with. We’re also deeply pleased that your safaris exceeded expectations and that the connection with our in-house ranger team added depth and discovery to your journey.

It means so much to us that you would recommend Hilton Yala so highly. You brought our space to life through your words, and we hope the doors of 306—and the wild magic of Yala—call you back again someday.

I don’t write hotel reviews easily but just felt that I had to with this resort. 

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff members offering cold towels & a cold drink & we were immediately made to feel welcome. This wasn’t a one off as the genuine smiles & greetings continued every day we stayed at the hotel. Whenever we returned back after our safaris we were welcomed by staff offering cold towels which were very welcome to cool down & wipe off the dust.

The General Manager, Gitanjali was very present in the hotel & made sure that she chatted to guests about their stay at her hotel. She had obviously carefully chosen & trained her staff to the highest standards & they clearly liked & respected her.

As the hotel is located in the Yala National Park, the safety of guests is treated very seriously by the staff. On arrival we had a safety briefing by one of the hotel rangers who emphasised that wild animals can & do wander through the resort. There is a track through the resort which is an ‘animal highway’ & there are raised walkways for the guests to use during daylight hours. Guests are not permitted to walk from their rooms to the main block & restaurant after dark but there are buggies that can be requested by calling reception. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a buggy whenever we called from our room. 

Now onto our room! We stayed in room 306 …….. where do I start? It was fabulous. The super king bed was really comfortable. We had a pillow menu but didn’t need to try any others as the ones on the bed were lovely. 
The room had a sitting area with a large TV that we only switched on once in the entire week. It had a dressing area leading to a huge bathroom with twin sinks, a stand alone bath tub & a large walk in shower. Now the toilet was definitely a talking point! It was a high tech Japanese lavatory with a sensor that opened the lid as you opened the cubicle door. It had a heated seat (not completely necessary when it’s 30 degrees!) it also had controls to wash your nether regions - front or back! It also had a drier too. 

There was a mini bar with some pay-for items along with complimentary items such as sodas that were replaced every day, along with bottles of water. We did have to call to ask for our sodas to be replaced a couple of times but this was a minor issue which was rectified quickly. If you like a cheeky drink in your room then I’d recommend you take any spirits with you as the mini bar bottles were very pricy. 

Outside there was a good sized private pool with a couple of sunloungers & a seating area. It was surrounded by trees & shrubs & we became obsessed with identifying the many birds from their songs using the Merlin bird ID app which I use a lot at home (highly recommend it but you will become addicted!) 

We also had visits from chipmunks & small lizards outside & hoped to see the residents monkeys but they didn’t make a visit to our pool area although we saw them a few times on the roof at the main hotel block. A couple of girls who were on the first safari with us didn’t heed the warnings to keep their patio door closed when they arrived & had an afternoon nap until they were woken by 10 monkeys exploring their room & knocking over their toiletries in the bathroom! A valuable lesson learned. 

The main pool area is large & well laid out but we didn’t actually use it. We had a safari every day either morning or afternoon ( a couple of days we did both) & just chilled around our own pool before or after we went out. 

The food was fabulous & the Executive Chef Jerome was very visible in the restaurant, chatting to guests & asking whether there was anything special they would like eat. He asked us to challenge him & his team with what we would love for dinner so they could prepare us a special meal on one of the evenings. My husband loves hot & spicy food while I’m the opposite. We were presented with an Indian banquet with starters & mains to suit our individual tastes. It was absolutely delicious.

Even when he was on his days off Jerome had briefed the deputy chef & he introduced himself to us to ask what we would like to have prepared for us on our last night. We were blown away by this level of service & once again had a fabulous banquet made especially for us. 

Now onto our main reason for visiting Yala - the safaris. I’m a keen photographer & love wildlife. We were lucky enough to visit Tanzania two years ago where we went on amazing safaris in three different National parks. We had a fantastic time & to be honest we were warned that we might feel disappointed with a Sri Lankan safari after an African one. This was not the case - they were just very different & special. 

My husband researched the best places to visit in Sri Lanka & found the Hilton Yala Resort which is one of a very few that are located inside Yala National Park itself. It employs its own highly trained rangers & offers different safaris to suit the guests. It is possible to book your own safaris from outside the hotel if you book the hotel on a different package but I would highly recommend using the hotel’s own safaris. There are many private safari companies but I seriously doubt if many of them have such highly trained rangers/trackers with the knowledge & expertise that we received. 

The hotel package we booked included one safari per night we stayed in the hotel. Our assigned ranger was called Saj (Sajith) & we were so lucky to have him & our driver Bodika for the duration of our stay. Saj’s knowledge & enthusiasm for the wildlife was second to none & we learned so much from him. He was able to answer all our questions & appeared to take genuine pleasure from our interest & enthusiasm for his country & its native wildlife. He was also a keen photographer himself so understood about the best positions to position the vehicle for camera angles & lighting & directed the driver where to stop. Our driver Bodika was fabulous! His driving skills were amazing & it was so much fun on the rougher tracks in the park - better than a roller coaster! 

Saj was able to find us the most amazing wildlife including leopards ( including two super-cute cubs!). To add to the experience he was also able to identify the adult leopards by name. The cubs won't be named until they reach adulthood & have territories of their own. We saw Elephants, Crocodiles, Golden Jackals & even a Sloth Bear, along with so many different types of birds - all identified by Saj. I was in heaven! I managed to take some wonderful photos which I’m still going through & enjoying the adventure all over again.

We had an outstanding holiday & would highly recommend the Hilton Yala Resort to anybody who loves the luxury of a fabulous hotel immersed in nature. We would love to return one day.","Wonderful safari hotel in stunning location with fabulous staff!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1010201508-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you ever so much for taking the time to share such a heartfelt and beautifully detailed review of your stay with us at Hilton Yala.

It was truly our pleasure to host you and we're thrilled to know your first visit to Sri Lanka—and your first experience with Hilton Yala—was nothing short of exceptional. We’re so pleased that the stunning setting, seamlessly blending the wild beauty of Yala with the comforts of a luxury resort, made for the perfect base for your safaris and serene poolside relaxation.

While we regret the initial hiccup with the room allocation, we’re grateful for your gracious understanding and so glad we were able to move you to the room of your choice overlooking the elephant trail. It’s wonderful to know you enjoyed the space, ambience, and comforts of the room, and that our team made you feel right at home with thoughtful service touches throughout.

Your kind words about our dining experiences—especially your compliments on the presentation and flavor of the dishes, as well as the flexibility extended by our culinary team—have been shared with our chefs, who were truly delighted to know they helped elevate your stay. And thank you for recognizing the little gestures from our poolside and housekeeping teams. I’ll be sure to personally pass on your special mention to Chanaka—he’ll be overjoyed to hear he made such a lasting impression.

We also appreciate your feedback on the spa, gym, and safari experience. We wholeheartedly agree that having a dedicated ranger adds an entirely new dimension to exploring the park, and we’re delighted you found the experience enriching and worth the extra value.

On behalf of the entire Hilton Yala family, thank you once again for choosing to spend your Sri Lankan adventure with us. Your kind words truly energize our team to keep doing what we love—creating unforgettable memories for guests like you. We very much look forward to welcoming you back, hopefully in the near future.

The reviews and photos that you see on Trip Advisor paints a true picture of the resort and experience and it did not disappoint.
This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we wanted to stay somewhere close to the National Park so that we could do the odd safari or two, whilst also relaxing by the pool of the main resort. The location was ideal, with it being right in the National Park
and only a short drive away to the main entrance of block 1. 
Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted with a cold towel and welcome drink and then shown into the main entrance to the hotel, through a huge doorway that led into the reception, lounge and bar area. From here, there are floor to ceiling windows with a view over the resort, pool area and Indian ocean, giving a true wow factor.

Having pre-selected our room through the Hilton app 24 hours prior to arrival to be close to the elephant trail, we were then taken by buggy to our room. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded to a premium room with plunge pool.
Unfortunately, our pre-selection hadn’t been noted and we were allocated a room next to the main pool. We raised this with the hotel team and were initially told that the rooms are allocated 48 hours in advance and therefore they hadn’t received our request. This was swiftly resolved and we were then taken to the pre-selected room.
The room was very luxurious, with plenty of space, soft furnishings and mood lighting. The bed was very comfortable with a pillow menu at your disposal. The bathroom had twin sinks, rainfall shower, bathtub and a Toto toilet. The terrace had a table and chairs, two sun loungers, a sofa and the plunge pool. It overlooked the elephant trail, that runs through the hotel grounds and whilst there was evidence of wild animals having walked past, we didn’t see any during our stay.
The room was cleaned daily with a turn down service in the evening.

We spent most of our time by the main pool and as most guests are here for the National Park and safaris, it was mostly quiet and felt like our own private pool at times. There were plenty of sun loungers and the pool staff were always very friendly and greeted you with a warm welcome and smile.

The food offered in the hotel is up there with some of the best food we have had and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded from continental to full breakfast, along with 25% off food and spa treatments. For breakfast, you can order a variety of dishes a-la-carte and there is also a small buffet area with pastries and cereal. Each dish was beautifully presented and was delicious. Our personal favourites were the hummus on rye toast and French toast! All meals are served in the Dhira restaurant, which is next to the reception and bar area. There is another restaurant on the ground floor, near the main pool, however this was not used during our stay as most guests are seated in the Dhira restaurant. 
For evening meals, you have the option to choose from a variety of menus offering local and international dishes. All meals were delicious and again, well presented. We were also encouraged to order dishes off menu, as the head chef encouraged you to eat whatever you fancied!
We would have the occasional lunch sat by the pool area and the food was equally well presented.

The spa and gym are well appointed and we used both during our stay. The spa treatments were great and the staff very welcoming.

We went on two morning safaris and were able to see all that the National Park has to offer. We decided to book the safari directly with the hotel and whilst more expensive than other options available through Viator or other similar sites, it is worth paying the extra money. We had our own private vehicle and ranger and were given breakfast boxes whilst in the park. Having your own personal ranger allowed you to learn more about the park and resident animals. 

What really stood out for us during our stay, was the staff. Every single member of the Hilton Yala team were welcoming and friendly. Walking to the pool or restaurant in the morning, the room cleaners, gardeners, pool staff, buggy drivers would all stop, smile and say good morning as we walked past. It is therefore very difficult to name individual staff members. Having said that, Chanaka from the F&B team really set the tone for our stay. He was always kind and happy to serve our breakfast or dinner and would also encourage us to order as much as we wanted. 

Thank you Hilton Yala team for making our stay truly memorable and we will no doubt return in the near future.","True luxury in the heart of the Yala National Park","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1009254291-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you so much for your glowing review and for sharing such thoughtful reflections on your stay with us at Hilton Yala National Park.

It was truly an honor to welcome you, and we're overjoyed to know that your time here was among the best hotel experiences you've had. From the peaceful setting of the villas to the culinary offerings and attentive service, we’re thrilled that so many elements came together to create a memorable escape for you.

Your kind mention of the warm welcome, our General Manager Ms. Gitanjali Chakravarthy, and our Executive Chef means a great deal to all of us. We believe genuine guest engagement is the heart of hospitality, and it’s wonderful to know that this personal connection made such a positive impression on you. I’ll also make sure Chamara and the rest of the team hear your kind words — they’ll be delighted.

We wholeheartedly agree — two nights is never quite enough to truly unwind and explore all that Yala has to offer. We do hope you'll return for a longer stay next time, perhaps to experience a safari and spend more days immersed in the tranquility of the jungle.

Until then, thank you once again for your kind words and trust in Hilton. It was a pleasure having you with us.

The resort organises tours of the Yala National Park and had we had more time we would have done some of these.  From the warm greeting we had as we stepped out of our car we were struck by the quality of the staff and their warmth.  We had several long chats with the General Manager, Ms Gitanjali Chakravarthy, who was interested in our comments and feedback on the hotel.  The executive chef also circulated among guest seeking feedback.  This sort of personal engagement with guests is very impressive and is, no doubt, a reason why this hotel is so good.

What a joy it was to read your review — thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us in such detail.

We are truly humbled by your kind words and thrilled that Hilton Yala was the highlight of your Sri Lanka journey. From the moment you entered our ""Jurassic Park"" inspired lobby to the peaceful moments in your Premium King Pool Villa, it sounds like you embraced every part of the adventure — and that’s exactly what we hope for every guest.

Your appreciation of the unique design, the untouched natural setting, and our commitment to preserving the surrounding wildlife means the world to us. While we wish you’d spotted one of our gentle giants on the path near your villa, we’re glad you felt the magic of their presence all the same.

It’s wonderful to hear that our team was able to support you and your family, especially with the little touches like the kids’ arrangements and buggy rides. We always aim to create a space where families can relax, connect, and truly feel cared for.

Thank you also for recognizing the quality of our dining experience and our commitment to hospitality. Your loyalty to Hilton is something we never take for granted, and heartfelt feedback like yours is exactly what motivates us to keep delivering unforgettable moments.

We sincerely hope to welcome you and your family back for another remarkable stay in the wild beauty of Yala.

I had high expectations for this one and oh boy what a stunning hotel. 

The hotel is fairly new and is in the middle of the safari park, not even surrounded by fences or gates, this to maintain it's natural habitat with the animals. Elephants pass by walking, and sometimes sneak into the kitchen, and there's even a pond where a crocodile was spotted.

The big door of the lobby looked like you entered Jurassic Park and it had grey stone elements and high ceilings, only the T rex was missing. Massive floor to ceiling windows overlook the resort and sea. We received a short briefing from a ranger ref security and safety and were told not to leave the rooms ourselves after 6pm.

We were upgraded to Premium king pool villa and i let the pics speak for itself. Massive bathroom with tub and shower, and space where every woman (and man) can dream off. Kids bed was also arranged and 1 sofabed was installed. 

Large terrace with sunloungers and the plungepool. We were located right on the corner of the path were elephants pass through. (However none spotted during our stay).

Around 40 rooms big this resort serves dinner and breakfast in the main resto, next to the lobby.  A la carte is served and we received HH discount.

The next day we did Yala safari's with a private driver, not done through the resort as i found prices were very high. 

After that we relaxed in the massive pool with sunbeds in the water, several jacuzzi sections and a kidspool. Don't be afraid when you see a snake swimming as they're not harmfull :-) the pool seemed endless.

The resort also organises morning walks to the beach (rocks) with its high dunes and massive waves. Not much more to do here.

This hotel was the hilight of our Sri Lanka trip and so well organised and neat. Staff were friendly and helpfull with the kids (buggy drive) and the food was of high quality. 

Hotels like these remind me why i stay loyal to to Hilton brand, as now and then you find a real gem.","This place feels like you're in Jurassic Park :-)","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1003923301-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

It is certainly one of them. 

I have traveled extensively and was pleasantly surprised over and over again during my two stays at the Marino Beach Hotel.   Why?  Staffing and service; rooms and  guest amenities; and unexpected extras.   

Staffing and service: the staff at Marino Beach hotel is plentiful, responsive, welcoming, and well-trained.   They exude self-respect and respect for their guests.   There was always someone available when needed at the concierge desk, dining room, check-in, and for special requests.   In fact, the hotel has a ""hostess"" in the lobby who greets you immediately when you enter or come off the elevator and answers questions or directs you where needed.  The manager sits at a desk right in the lobby, so they always know what is going on on the floor and can help as needed.   The staff teams in each area seem to have a chain of command, but everyone also cheerfully pitches in and appear to enjoy each other's company.   How did they achieve this positive culture so consistently throughout the organization?   I don't know, but I think other organizations could learn a lot by studying them. 

Rooms and amenities:  Whoever designed the Marino Beach Hotel took the best features from every other 5-star hotel and put them all in one place.  My favorites: 1) There is great lighting in the bathroom and even a lighted make-up mirror!  The bathroom also features a separate tub and walk-in shower; a drying line; hooks for your towel; lots of toiletry supplies of all kinds; easily accessible towels; and clear walls so it feels spacious, but also has an electric shade if you want to wall off the bathroom from the bedroom.  The sinktop has room for all our stuff.  The water pressure is excellent and it's easy to adjust the water temperature.   The bathroom is perfect. 

2) There is balcony with a sea view from every room and two comfortable chairs, which is also a great place to dry your bathing suit. 

3) The bed is large and comfy, and each side of the bed can control its own reading light, a bedside light, and the room lights.  Wow!   

4) There is lots of storage in the room: a large closet with drawers and plenty of hangers; bedside tables with two spacious drawers in each; and other various nooks and drawers for your stuff.    There is also a lot of tabletop surface.   

5) The room is large, nicely appointed and spotlessly clean.  You can control the temperature.  It has sunblocking drapes as well as light white drapes.   The room has a refrigerator and a safe, both of which work easily.   There is a water boiler and a selection of tea and coffee with condiments.  The space feels great. 

6) The hotel itself has a stunning and large infinity pool on the roof, with different areas for seating -- at the edge of the pool, in the water; in sunbeds with curtains;  and sunbeds in the garden.   Even when there were a lot of people a the pool, you never felt crowded.   And there are three hottubs!  Enough for everyone!  The pool even has a smaller, separated area, which is where the families tended to hang out.  The smaller pool felt safer for kids, I think.  

Unexpected Extras:
This is where Marino Beach Hotel especially shines and delights guests.   

1) There is a FREE, 3-hour city tour that covers many of the major sights in Colombo, and gives you time to get off the bus and actually visit the sites.  The hotel pays for entrance fees.   Unfortunately, my husband and I did not do the hotel's city tour because, before we arrived in Colombo, we had scheduled other touristy things that filled our days.  But when we talked with guests who did the hotel's city tour we were very sad that we had toured with other organizations.  The Marino Beach Hotel tour sounded better than anything we had done. 

2) The Hotel owns a BEACH AREA with a restaurant, sunbeds, and a beautiful clean beach only 10 minutes away.  There are hourly shuttles to the beach area.   FANTASTIC. 

3) There are sodas and water in the refrigerator, and cookies and peanuts on the counter for guests to consume. . . free of charge. So sweet. 

4) The hotel restaurants are all top-of-the-line.  In fact, we ended our tour in-country a day early so we could come back to Marino Beach and enjoy the pool, the gym, and especially the fantastic restaurants.   On the 10th floor, there is an Ocean Grill and a Chinese/Thai restaurant; you can order from both menus.   The sea bass at the Ocean Grill with lemon butter sauce was TO DIE FOR.    All their entrees come with a choice of sauces.  My husband had a great hamburger.   The breakfast buffet has too many  options; we always ended up stuffing ourselves.   Be sure to reserve the breakfast buffet when you reserve your room -- it costs twice as much if you have to buy breakfast separately. 

Finally, I will tell you that the Marino Beach Hotel will be listed as a 4-star hotel in the websites like TripAdvisor.  It is a 5-star hotel or better, but the government of Sri Lanka requires a minimum room charge for 5-star hotels that is higher than what Marino Beach charges.   We felt like the Marino Beach Hotel was a fantastic value.   You just won't go wrong in any way at this place.  At least, that was our experience.","One of the best hotels in the world.  No kidding.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d14106301-r1000793319-Marino_Beach_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",

The view of the Pacific Ocean is lovely . There was one setback in my room . I couldn’t sit on the balcony due to the smells emanating from the kitchen below . Otherwise it would be nice to go for the sea view rooms and sit and bask in the sultry weather , watching the waves crashing on the shore in full force . The people are friendly and helpful and it’s a clean city overall . A visit to Colombo for a holiday is a very good idea, and I hope to make it again here soon .

Noch mal vielen Dank an den fließend Deutsch sprechenden Gästebetreuer Jan, der sich viel Zeit nahm für alles Wichtige zur Ayurveda Kur kenntnisreich zu erklären und mich mit seinem umfangreichen Wissen über Land und Leute bereichert hat.
Auch herzlichen Dank an das Service Team, sowie Nalin und Suhad, die uns liebevoll umsorgt haben.  Auch das Essen ist ganz ausgezeichnet ! Ich hatte zu der Zeit Geburtstag und das Küchenteam hat mich mit einer tollen Torte überrascht, zudem bekam ich ein Geschenk über das ich mich sehr gefreut habe ! 
Überhaupt ist das ganze Team von den Ärzten, Masseuren, bis hin zum Gärtner immer zugewandt, aufmerksam, freundlich und versucht alle Wünsche zu erfüllen.
Zu erwähnen ist auch die traumhafte Lage des Garden Beach Resort. Alle Zimmer haben Meerblick. Der Strand ist nahezu menschenleer und wenn man Glück hat, kann man Wasserschildkröten bei der Eiablage beobachten.
Nach wundervollen zwei Wochen habe ich mich total erholt und entspannt gefühlt. Wer eine Ayurveda Kur mache möchte hat hier eine traumhafte Zeit. Ich kann es nur jedem empfehlen.

Auch herzlichen Dank an das Service Team, sowie Nalin und Suhad, die uns liebevoll umsorgt hatten.
Überhaupt ist das ganze Team von den Ärzten, Masseuren, bis hin zum Gärtner immer zugewandt, aufmerksam und freundlich.
Zu erwähnen ist auch die traumhafte Lage des Garden Beach Resort. Alle Zimmer haben Meerblick und das Rauschen der Wellen ist ein ständiger Begleiter. Der Strand ist nahezu menschenleer und wenn man Glück hat, kann man Wasserschildkröten bei der  Eiablage beobachten.

Ein besonderes Lob geht an Janaka, den deutschen Gästebetreuer. Er war stets für uns da, half bei allen Anliegen und gab wertvolle Tipps für unsere Zeit in Sri Lanka. Seine Unterstützung machte den Aufenthalt noch angenehmer, und wir haben uns rundum wohlgefühlt.

Das Resort selbst liegt idyllisch direkt am Meer – ein perfekter Ort zum Entspannen und Abschalten. Die Ayurveda-Behandlungen waren professionell und individuell auf unsere Bedürfnisse abgestimmt. Auch das Essen war ein Genuss: frisch, gesund und unglaublich lecker! Das ganze Hotel-Feeling war sowohl unter den Gästen, als auch mit den Mitarbeiter*innen des Hotels sehr familiär.

Wer neben der Entspannung auch etwas erleben möchte, hat zahlreiche Ausflugsmöglichkeiten in der Umgebung. Ob eine Bootsfahrt auf dem Madu River, ein Besuch des Schildkrötenprojekts in Kosgoda oder eine Tour nach Galle – Janaka und das Team halfen uns, unvergessliche Erlebnisse zu planen.

Anstelle eines gewöhnlichen Jahresurlaubs entschieden wir uns auf ärztlichen Rat für eine Ayurveda-Kur, um das Immunsystem meiner Frau ganzheitlich zu stärken und neue Energie zu tanken. Der Arzt empfahl nicht nur 1–2 Wochen, sondern eine intensive vierwöchige Kur, um die volle Wirkung dieser jahrtausendealten Heiltradition zu entfalten.

Nach einer sorgfältigen Recherche stießen wir auf das Resort ""The Garden Beach"" in Kosgoda, SriLanka. Dieses ruhige Paradies bietet die originale Ayurveda-Kur, betreut von erfahrenen Ärzten, die jeden Gast individuell begleiten. Was uns ganz besonders gefiel, ist die speziell abgestimmte Küche: Hier gibt es kein Buffet, sondern individuell für jeden Gast zubereitete Mahlzeiten, die auf die Bedürfnisse seines Körpers abgestimmt sind. Der Hausmanager Janaka nimmt sich immer Zeit, das Ayurveda-Prinzip zu erklären, die Zubereitung der Gerichte näherzubringen und alle Fragen rund um die Kur, Ernährung und Behandlungen zu beantworten.

Das Resort liegt direkt am Strand, etwas ab vom Massentourismus. Diese Abgeschiedenheit ermöglicht es den Gästen, sich voll und ganz auf ihre Gesundheit und Erholung zu konzentrieren. Dennoch bietet die Umgebung zahlreiche Möglichkeiten für Entdeckungen: Wir unternahmen einen Ausflug nach Galle, einer charmanten Stadt im Süden der Insel, und erkundeten einige der nahegelegenen Sehenswürdigkeiten, wie die Lagune, eine Mine für Edelsteine, eine Zimtproduktion, sowie einen Kräutergarten.

Wenn Sie auf der Suche nach einer Reise sind, die Körper und Geist in Einklang bringt, könnte eine Ayurveda-Kur in Sri Lanka genau das Richtige für Sie sein. Lassen Sie sich inspirieren und erleben Sie eine Auszeit, die nachhaltig wirkt.

Die ayurvedische Küche – Ein überraschender Genuss:
Zu Beginn hatten wir große Bedenken, ob die ayurvedische Küche unseren Geschmack treffen würde. Doch wir wurden schnell eines Besseren belehrt! Das Essen war nicht nur köstlich, sondern auch reichlich – jede Mahlzeit bestand aus vier Gängen, die perfekt abgestimmt waren.

Besonders beeindruckend war, dass jedes Gericht immer alle sechs Geschmacksrichtungen – süß, sauer, salzig, bitter, herb und scharf – enthielt, wie es im Ayurveda üblich ist.

Trotz der fleischlosen Küche und des Verzichts auf Süßigkeiten haben wir nichts vermisst. Die Gerichte waren so abwechslungsreich und wohltuend, dass wir uns nach kurzer Zeit voller Energie und völlig zufrieden fühlten.

Also alles in allem eine empfehlenswerte Reise, die unseren Körper und Geist wieder aufgebaut hat.","Das Garden Beach Resort ist eine kleine Ayurveda-Oase, genau richtig zum Ausspannen und Erholen.","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d11869487-r997222865-The_Garden_Beach_Ayurveda_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

herzlichen Dank für Ihre ausführliche Bewertung und dafür, dass Sie sowohl Ihr Lob als auch Ihre Kritik mit uns geteilt haben.

Es freut uns sehr zu hören, dass Sie deutliche Verbesserungen durch die Ayurveda-Behandlung erfahren haben und die Hingabe unseres Ärzteteams sowie aller Mitarbeitenden – von der Rezeption über die Küche bis zu den Therapeut:innen – geschätzt haben. Ihre lobenden Worte über „Jan Wikipedia“ und das gesamte Serviceteam ehren uns sehr und motivieren uns, weiterhin unser Bestes zu geben.

Gleichzeitig bedauern wir es aufrichtig, dass der Zustand der Hotelanlage Ihren Gesamteindruck getrübt hat. Ihre Anmerkungen zu den infrastrukturellen Mängeln – von Klimaanlage und Sanitär bis hin zu Ausstattung und Mobiliar – sind vollkommen berechtigt.

Wir möchten Sie – und alle zukünftigen Gäste – darüber informieren, dass das Resort im Juli für umfassende Renovierungsarbeiten geschlossen wurde. Die Modernisierungen umfassen unter anderem renovierte Zimmer und Bäder, verbesserte Elektro- und Wassersysteme, neue Matratzen, frische Textilien, aufgewertete Strandeinrichtungen und vieles mehr. Unser Ziel ist es, den Erwartungen unserer geschätzten Gäste gerecht zu werden und gleichzeitig die ruhige, authentische Ayurveda-Atmosphäre zu bewahren.

Wir würden uns freuen, wenn Sie sich in Zukunft doch noch einmal für einen Aufenthalt bei uns entscheiden, um die Veränderungen persönlich zu erleben. Ihr Feedback hat maßgeblich dazu beigetragen, diese Verbesserungen anzustoßen.

Mit herzlichen Grüßen und den besten Wünschen für Ihre Gesundheit

Vielen Dank für Ihre lieben Worte und das wertvolle Feedback. Es freut uns sehr, dass Sie Ihre erste Ayurveda-Kur bei uns genossen haben und sich gut betreut gefühlt haben – besonders durch unser Team.

Der sehr gut deutsch sprechende Janaka im Management hat viele gute Tipps und Erklärungen zu Land, Leuten und Aryuveda. 

Ein bisschen Kritik haben wir allerdings auch: die Anlage ist zu klein für mehr als 15 Gäste. In der Hochsaison zwischen den Jahren kamen noch zusätzlich Gäste aus der nebenan liegenden Villa hinzu.

Once you have relaxed and are ready the experience continues as you are escorted through the beautiful gardens to your home for the duration of your stay (I say home because there is no way you could simply describe what you are stepping into as a ROOM). I could have easily stayed in my new home for at least a week without going outside, the decor is unbelievable the bathroom well you must see it to believe it.
Everything is catered for in your new home and if it isn't there then just simply pick up the phone and it will be there very quickly, delivered with a smile. 
Moving on to your dining experience, (as it is easy to write a small visitors guide just on your new home), the waiters would give the any Royal staff member a run for their money, I can honestly say in all my years of traveling and staying at such hotels as the Chedi (Oman) and the Burj Al Arab (Dubai) these have to be the most considerate and professional waiters I have ever had the pleasure to meet,  It was a pleasure every meal time to meet these guys, their knowledge off the food being served combined with the skill and care in which they gave the amazing food the Chef had prepared when serving you was outstanding. Put all this together with the beautiful peaceful surroundings you have a perfect place to start your day with the wide selection of breakfast available cooked to your  personnel requirements, followed by a day of relaxing around the pool side or if you wish spend an hour or two being pampered at the Spa. I could write so much more about my stay at the Reef Villa Spa, but rather than do that I will just finish by saying if you want to treat yourself to an experience of a life time then you will not be disappointed when you come and stay here.

A big thank you to Brendan & Bernadette the pups and their amazing team for making our stay so special we will be seeing you again.

This hotel is so unique and beautiful. 
On arrival, we entered a beautiful long walkway which was an oasis of trees, plants and water gardens. It felt like we were escaping into a whole other world. A complete oasis of tranquillity and nature. So that was a great start!

The main hotel and reception area is surrounded by all these beautiful antiques. I could have spent hours three exploring all the beautiful artefacts. Just on the right hand side there was another beautiful seating area surrounded by a beautiful water garden, swing sofa, and local fish. You could spend an evening there just listening to the sounds of nature and enjoying the tranquillity.

The hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, they showed us around to hotel to help us get our bearings. We were led out to a beautiful large garden just Infront of the beach. It is surrounded by palm trees, a fabulous pool and outdoor restaurant where breakfast and dinner is served. Simply stunning.

We were then showed to our suite which was another lovely experience getting there. We were led along this beautiful walkway surrounded by tall greenery. (You feel connected to the nature at all time here)
  
Our suite was a complete WOW. So luxurious and completely unique. All the amazing artefacts and antiques. 
The attention to detail in the suite itself was so impressive and beautiful from the luxurious bedding, cushions, shower gels, bath salts, seating areas, interesting antiques to high vaulted wooded celling, 4 poster bed, gigantic bathtub, additional outdoor shower etc.

Our suite led out to a beautiful private garden and patio area (which included 2 seething areas, a swing sofa and beautiful water garden complete with fish!)
We also had direct access to the garden and pool area.
 

Our stay here was magical and so relaxing. From laying by the pool reading our books, to taking long walks on the beach, watching the sunset etc

One night we had dinner in our fabulous suite. The staff pulled out all the stops in delivering our meals, It was a lovely experience. The food was also divine.
The Sri Lankan breakfast was delicious

The owners clearly put a lot of work into creating this stunning hotel. The attention to detail has to be applauded.  

It’s perfect for couples and families of all ages. You will feel like you are in paradise. 

My husband and I 100% recommend this beautiful hotel .

We could not have picked a better place to do this than the Reef Villa and Spa.

The hotel has the feel of a colonial villa and is set in a botanical garden paradise complete with parrots. The bedroom suites are massive, extremely comfortable and have huge bathrooms.  The suites and public areas are tastefully furnished and decorated with real antiques and objet d’art.

The standard of service from the staff is exceptional, and from the moment you arrive we felt that we were treated more like house guests rather than just another hotel guest.

The open-air restaurant next to the pool, and overlooking the Indian Ocean was very good and served marvelous fresh fish and seafood.

In the morning it is fun and interesting to walk along the coconut palm fringed beach and watch the local fishing families deploy and retrieve their drag nets and go for swim afterwards in the warm sea. The ocean swim was suggested by the pool attendant who on realising that my wife was nervous about doing so, came onto the beach and  kept and kept an eye on her.

We have stayed in lots of excellent boutique hotels around the world, but in terms of decor and quality of staff The Reef Villa is one of the best.","Exceptional - Highly Recommended","2020-01","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r748120143-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

It features a refined and alluring decor, including art and design items carefully collected by the hotel's owners, an interior designer and architect couple. The main villa has soaring ceilings and cozy sitting areas. The rooms are spacious and luxurious, while also being intimate. Our room had a huge stone bathtub for two, a shower and an outdoor shower. We also had a private sitting area and fish pond. The pool is gorgeous and overlooks well maintained grounds, dotted with swaying palms. The restaurant is open and faces the pool and gardens. The quality is excellent and the menu creative. The Sri Lankan breakfast was also delicious.

The staff are what make this a truly special place though, they always have a smile on their face and show a true passion for what they do. 

I asked Nishanka and Dino to arrange a surprise BBQ in the gardens near the beach for my partners birthday. Dino even took our pre order for dinner that afternoon to keep it a surprise! I would recommend asking for the BBQ for anyone who stays here, we were served a variety of seafood, chicken and steak along with a selection of sides, all cooked to perfection, it was a real treat. 

During our 8 night stay we didn’t go out for any other meals in the local area as we didn’t consider there to be better food available elsewhere. The food was top class with a service to match. The menu has a good selection of food too so we didn’t get bored during our stay, we both highly rated the restaurant at the Reef.

A period of colonial opulence typified by ornate furniture and punkah’s. The latter are present in abundance throughout the property in fully restored and operational condition. Fortunately there is also air conditioning!

As you enter through the main building the vista of the grounds open up before you and leads to the crashing sound of the Indian Ocean. Swaying palm trees are dotted around the lawns which host a beautiful infinity pool whose temperature at the time of our stay was pleasantly warm under the heat of the sun.

The hub of the property is the dining area next to the pool where all meals, snacks and drinks are prepared and served. For guests convenience there are buzzers located throughout the property from where you can request service from the staff. It usually takes about 30 to 45 seconds for the staff to respond.

We spent five nights here following a full tour of Sri Lanka and found the Reef to be the perfect place to relax and chill before returning to Colombo and the journey home. We did not need to lift a finger because the staff relieved us of all responsibility, nothing was too much trouble. The staff team were amazing, each carrying out their role effectively to provide effortless comfort for the guest. Our room (Olu) was amazing, spacious, comfortable, clean, cool and a haven of luxury to return to after a tiring day at the pool! The bathroom was large enough to host a rugby team after training. The granite bath would have taken at least half the team! We enjoyed our daily sessions in the private outdoor jacuzzi attached to our room.

The food was excellent. High quality ingredients cooked well and presented to a high standard. By Sri Lankan standards the menu was expensive, by English standards it was equivalent to gastro pub prices. Wine and other alcoholic beverages were much more expensive than in Sri Lanka generally with a bottle of wine averaging 6500 to 7000 slk (about £27 to £30 @ 235 slk to 1GBP at the time of writing). 

We took the opportunity to book a 45 minute whole body massage. Be advised that the Reef does not employ its own staff but arranges for a therapist to come in and fulfil the booking. We would describe the massage as gently relaxing, not unpleasant but certainly not therapeutic. Of the massages that we had during our 18 day tour, this was without doubt the weakest.

The beach directly in front of the Reef was kept clean by the Reef staff and swept every day. Unfortunately once you progressed beyond the hotel frontage the state of the beach is deplorable. It was more than a little disconcerting to watch the local fishermen land their catch as there was nearly as much plastic in the net as there was fish. Rubbish was burnt on the beach and at no time did we see any beach cleaning equipment or personnel except for The Reef personnel.

Don’t let that detract from the amazing service that the Reef provides as there is no requirement upon guests to leave the grounds of the property unless like us you love to walk on the beach. A word of warning, the sand is very gritty which makes walking in bare feet quite difficult if you have sensitive feet. If you have sand shoes then we would advise taking them.

We can thoroughly recommend a few days here at the end of a tour to regroup and leave only a short journey back to the airport.

Would we return to the Reef Villa and Spa?..................definitely!","Tranquility in the opulence of the Raj","2020-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r743936990-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

We particularly enjoyed our large verandah and the Indian swing, as we watched the coloured fish swimming buy. The food was excellent. I was very pleased to be able to pre-order as I have a dietary issue and every meal was carefully adapted for me. The presentation was also superb. I extend my thanks to both outstanding cooks. The staff were delightful.  Ever kind, helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The pool is lovely and it’s a great place from which to sit and watch the sun setting over the sea, with a tipple in hand.

They masterfully cleaned up, no matter the mess we made. 
There are a lot of activities inside the hotel like: gym, tennis court, everything to play volleyball, spa, karaoke, pool and swimming pool. 
The main feature of the hotel is that it has a private beach and even a private reef! It prevents high ocean waves from disturbing your swim in nearby waters. Though the reef bottom may be a bit sharp, the hotel gives out special slippers so it is not painful. The beach itself (and the hotel as a whole) is very well-kept and tidy. You can also rent a kayak if you're tired of swimming. 
Also a detail worth noticing is the hospitality, with which the staff welcomes you. But it doesn't stop there. Throughout your whole stay you will encounter smiles and kind words. 
Special thanks to the general manager, who is very kind, caring and attentive, and to food and beverage department, which provided us superb meals and a luxury service. We want to thank Karthik, Ashitha, Ranu and Gihan. We would like to thank everybody who works there by their names, but we can't recall all of them. Sorry(

Dear Guest,

Ayubowan!!

Thank you for sharing your feedback and for choosing to stay with us. We’re delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spacious room, comfortable bed, and large terrace. We appreciate your understanding regarding the challenges with the coral in our area.

As you mentioned, the coral reef was significantly affected by the tsunami, and while it has sadly impacted the natural beauty of the sea, we make every effort to maintain the area by cleaning it daily. We provide the necessary equipment, like plastic shoes, to help make the experience more comfortable for our guests.

We also take note of your feedback regarding the food and coffee at breakfast, and we will look into improving these areas to ensure a better experience for future stays. We're pleased that you enjoyed the nearby local restaurants and the tranquility of our swimming pool. 

We hope you had the chance to explore the local attractions, such as the fish market and the coconut plantation. Thank you again for your comments, and we hope to welcome you back for another stay in the future.

There is a large hotel swimming pool.  When we were there in March, the hotel was quiet and we sometimes had the pool to ourselves.

We always strive to create a serene and tranquil environment for our guests, and it’s wonderful to know that you appreciated the calm waters during your stay.

Thank you for your kind words about the villa. We are happy that you found it spacious and comfortable, especially with the open-air bathtub – it’s always a favorite among our guests!

We certainly aim to make every moment memorable.

I’m pleased to know that the service was to your liking. Our team always strives to ensure that our guests feel well taken care of without being intrusive, and it’s fantastic that you appreciated their attention to detail.

Your feedback about the excursions has been noted, and I apologize if that part of your experience wasn’t as enjoyable. We understand that some trips require longer travel times, and we are always looking for ways to improve the offerings to make them more convenient for our guests.

I also appreciate your positive comments about the cuisine and our spa services. We pride ourselves on offering a variety of fresh dishes and a peaceful spa experience, so I’m happy to hear that both met your expectations.

Пляж у нашего отеля -ну такое. Лучше, чем на западном побережье, из-за отсутствия волн, но хуже, чем у соседнего отеля (10 минут легким шагом), из-за песочка завезенного и волн морских. У нас совсем штиль был все дни. И коралловое дно.
Точнее, не пляж ну такое, а именно вот вода и море.

Экскурсии, конечно, отстой полный. Я давно была, в 18ом году, поэтому забыла, что там все находится друг от друга в 4-8 часах езды. Хорошо, что только 1 экскурсию взяли. Я под конец дня умирала уже.

Вилла прям классная. Там часть санузла такая же как сам номер по квадратуре. Ванная под открытым небом.

С 8 марта поздравляли. Тортик по территории отеля всем предлагали вкусных. Всякие десерты весь день несли в номер. Вечером устроили у берега выступление для дам, караоке прям туда вынесли. Столики поставили, музыка и стробоскопы. Классно.

Отдельный плюс- в отеле никого почти и не было. Человек 10 за все время пребывания встретили и все.

Как будто весь отель наш, да и соседний тоже 😂 Там за 50$ можно было находиться и пользоваться всем отелем. Называется Uga bay.

Кухня хорошая, каждый день новые блюда. Есть вариант шведского стола периодически, а чаще- тебе дают планшет и ты выбирает стартер, основное, десерт и напитки (чай /кофе). Всякие фреши уже дополнительно. Не скажу, что дешево стоят, но вкусные.

К нам шеф повар выходил, спрашивал, все ли нравится, и что больше всего понравилось. Приятно. 
Да и сервис всегда подойдет и спросит, все ли хорошо, все ли нравится. Но они это делают не навязчиво, а всегда с тактом.

Территориия отеля красивая, отель свежий. Зелено, облагорожено, пляж убирают работники. Все есть, даже караоке. Спа зона с хамамом, парилкой и массажем. Стоит не дорого, oil massage 60min вышел 13500 lkr. 

В целом, офигенный пляжный отдых, Мальдивы на минималках. 😂
7-9 дней отдыха- самое то. Дольше было бы уже скучно.","Пассикудовка 😄🙌","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r997382689-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

The territory of the hotel is not very big, but generally well planned and kept nice, tidy and blooming. Itš a vey pleasant and relaxing feeling to be there. The hotel has 36 rooms, but during our stay there were very few guests, which very pleasantly coincided with our expectations for a quiet and peaceful vacation right by the beach. This was only occasionally disturbed by some hotel guests from Russia with their characteristic  loud behaviour and disregard for the presence of others. 
The rooms were very tastefully decorated, with everything you need for your stay. There was enough space to arrange your things. The rooms are really spacious, with a very huge, comfortable bathroom, which is partly under the open sky. The room had good air conditioning. Bed was big, pillows and mattress were very good and comfortable.
Our room was at ground level and it was nice to spend time in the shade, on the spacious terrace. We recommend not leaving anything edible or valuable on the terrace, because every now and then a gang of monkeys comes from the jungle and will gladly pick up or throw away everything that is not tied up. Also during breakfast you will be watched carefully not only by waiters to fulfil your every wish, but also by 5-7 crows, who are just waiting for you to get up from the table and leave your food unattended. Fortunately, they are not as intrusive as sparrows and patiently and attentively wait their turn to occupy your table.
The a la carte breakfast was delicious, with various good, tasty choices. The dinner menu looked quite pricy with comparison to not vey big portions and we went to eat outside hotel twice because here you can have giant fresh lobster for the price of hotel's salad. The hotel has delicious espresso and also a very large wine collection, which we did not try, because the hot climate did not invite us to drink any alcohol.
The pool is beautifully designed, large, comfortable, with pleasantly cool water, which is very refreshing in the hot climate. Lots of sunbeds and umbrellas around the pool. The minus is that the pool is not shaded at any time of the day.
The beach is clean and wide, but immediately behind the hotel a more gloomy reality with a littered beach began. Swimming in the ocean directly opposite the hotel is problematic, because there is a coral reef around the peninsula on which the hotel is located. On the one hand, this is positive, because there are no big waves, but on the other hand, it is actually too shallow to swim there and you need coral slippers, because there are pieces of coral under your feet, which are unpleasant to step on. Slippers according to your size will be given to you at the hotel pool. If you want to swim directly in the ocean, then you have to walk 10 minutes along the beach, to the place where the coral reef ends and swim there.
The spa center is very well decorated, with a good atmosphere. The massage was very nice, relaxing and professional. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the girl’s name, but good that she is the only masseuse! She was great! On the day when I had been in the sun too much, she even brought me an aloe leaf from the hotel garden, which was very helpful.
The entire hotel staff is very diligent, attentive and responsive. I would especially like to mention those with whom we communicated the most - Thirasa and Sasitha in the restaurant, who did their job sincerely and attentively. Also Karthik and Chamop did their best as well as the people at the reception, the chef in the kitchen and the gardeners in the garden and on the beach did everything to make all the guests feel great! Some women in the garden and on the beach were working non stop from early morning till late noon. I hope they are paid accordingly for their intense work.
I would like to say hello to hotel's landscape architect and say that paths to the room's entrance doors  are planned vey funny and not comfortably at all. You and staff need to navigate through bushes and flowerbeds or almost through other guest's terrace, to get to your main door. The paths to the terrace doors of the rooms is very comfortable and well planned, but it's a pity that you can't lock this door from outside. So you need to choose between leaving your room open or lock the room, leave through the other door and then navigate the bushes.","A beautiful new beach hotel to relax right by the ocean.","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r994130964-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

I had a massage at the Spa Ceylon branch on the corner from the hotel. It was a fantastic massage experience. We had dinner at 'The Archives' a short walk from the hotel and it was amazing, would recommend. I really enjoyed this hotel. before dinner we went for a drink at the Galle Fort Hotel, we sat on the verandah and enjoyed the history of the Fort.

I am so glad it was because really enjoyed stay at The Merchant. It is an old building with outside courtyard dining ( accepts walk ins). The welcome was very warm with a lovely welcome drink provided .

The hotel is in the Main Street of Galle Fort but it is hard for any accomodation in Galle Fort to be anywhere other than convenient . The Fort is very busy with tourists during the day but the room and hotel is quiet, without the huge tourist groups which featured at other hotels at which I stayed. 

The room was not that large but had an outdoor balcony .   The bed was very comfortable. Everything you could need- Filtered water , coffee and tea provided and refilled on request. Toiletries were good including the provision of a lovely smelling anti- Mosi cream. 

Breakfast was gorgeous and relaxed though the coffee was too strong for even me to drink. Ate here for lunch and on pricier side as you might Expect from a quality hotel but there are loads of places around at which to eat.

The manager Chamika deserves so much credit for his management of this hotel. Its venue, its service, its food, its drink, its overall value for money is just brilliant. Yes, we were upgraded to a superb room and facilities, but the hotel overall was just world class. We ate lunch, two breakfasts, and due to a power cut during our stay, we had room service which was just fantastic. 

This was the last hotel at the end of our 11 days stay in Sri Lanka and what a way to round it all off. The city is steeped in history, as is this wonderful hotel. 

Our whole experience of this amazing hotel will be remembered forever. Thank you, Chamika and your whole team, for their excellence, service, skills and friendly nature.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for sharing your thoughtful reflections on your recent three-night stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed our prime location for exploring Sigiriya Rock and that Samman, your dedicated butler, made your stay extra special—he’ll be thrilled to know his service stood out.
It’s wonderful that you embraced the charm of our Marsh Dwelling and its quirky “outdoor” bathroom, and that you found time to relax in your private spa bath after hiking. I must apologize for the unexpected frog encounter in the pipes—it seems our local wildlife fancied an upgrade! Rest assured, our engineering team is now double-checking all plumbing to make sure your next bath is frog-free. I’m glad you enjoyed spotting the playful monkeys by the pool and that our breakfast offerings hit the mark. I’m sorry, however, that our dinner menu became repetitive during your three-night stay. We’re already expanding seasonal options and rotating daily specials to keep our culinary program fresh and exciting for returning guests.

Regarding the open-air spa pavilions and the inevitable insects they attract, I appreciate your understanding of the balance between nature immersion and comfort. We are continually enhancing our citronella gardens, installing additional screening where possible, and providing extra insect-repellent amenities in each treatment room.

Thank you again for highlighting both what thrilled you and where we can improve. We hope to welcome you back soon in the future. 

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

The staff are very friendly, our butler Samman was particularly great. We stayed in a Marsh Dwelling. The room itself was very quirky and a unique experience which was fun. The bathroom is ""outside"", while still being private. Perhaps an odd experience, but there were alternate loos as well. 

We used the bath/spa in the room after hiking Sigiriya. Lovely deep bath, but be careful of frogs in the pipes! We accidentally boiled some... 🐸 

Our pool area was lovely and we got to see some ""greedy"" monkeys playing in the trees which was very special. 

The food was ok, not great not bad. The menu was the same everyday, so 3 days was enough time to get bored of the offering. The breakfast however was good. Try and spot the crocodile!

The spa was ok, good value. A 90 minute massage was £45 GBP. However, the spa treatment rooms are open above the water so there were a lot of bugs.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for taking the time to share your impressions of Jetwing Vil Uyana. I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spacious Forest Dwelling with Pool. 

Please allow me to clarify our approach to comfort and sustainability: each of our dwellings are thoughtfully outfitted with a traditional sarong—placed in your room along with simple instructions on how to wear it—as an eco-friendly alternative to bathrobes. Of course, we are always happy to provide bathrobes upon request, and I apologize that this option wasn’t made clear during your arrival.

I also regret the delay at check-in and that your butler was on break when you arrived. We are reviewing our break schedules and enhancing our internal communications to ensure a warm, prompt welcome—especially when arrival times are confirmed in advance.
I’m glad you enjoyed your dinner and found our team’s service generally “mostly decent,” despite the brevity of your stay. Your feedback on those small lapses is invaluable and will help us raise our standards. Should you return for a longer stay, I would welcome the opportunity to personally ensure you have everything you need—from a swift check-in to uninterrupted butler service—and to arrange any activities you wish to enjoy in our eco-friendly sanctuary.

Thank you again for both your praise and your constructive comments. We hope you’ll stay with us again—perhaps for a longer break—to fully experience all that  Jetwing Vil Uyana has to offer.

Although the bedroom upstairs had an on suite toilet, the shower was downstairs.  But a first world problem, admittedly!

Weirdly for such an upscale hotel, bathrobes were not provided, especially given the remoteness of the shower from the bedroom, quite a walk!  

We only had one dinner and the food was very good

Service was not flawless but mostly decent enough.  Our room came with a butler but when we arrived (within 90 seconds of the exact time when we told them we would, in response to an earlier Whatsapp) he was on his break!  

The check-in was slow which is not what one wants after a long drive. 

We were only there one night, as a stopover to break the very long drive from the tea country to the north-east beyond Trincomalee.  So did not really have enough time to relax and enjoy the facilities. The resort is designed to be Eco-friendly, and has a spa, but we did not use so cannot comment.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed impressions of your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. It was a pleasure hosting you and your family, and I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spacious dwelling, private pool, and the tranquil rice-field views that make our eco-lodge truly unique. I’m especially grateful for your kind words about our team’s service.

We pride ourselves on anticipating our guests’ needs—though I understand that at times our attentiveness may feel abundant. Please rest assured that your comfort and privacy are always our foremost concern, and I will speak with our colleagues to maintain the perfect balance. I also appreciate your feedback regarding wildlife sightings. While the wetlands and surrounding forests are home to crocodiles, otters, and the elusive loris, Nature is wonderfully unpredictable. I’m pleased our team was able to secure a special evening excursion so you could experience the loris firsthand. We are continually working with our wildlife guides to enhance the availability and timing of such tours and will look into expanding options for crocodile and otter spotting.

Regarding our cuisine, we strive to deliver authentic meals that showcase the richness of Sri Lankan flavors, prepared with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Our Executive Chef and I are continuously reviewing and refining our menu to introduce more signature dishes that blend traditional tastes with innovative culinary techniques. 

Finally, I understand your concerns about value for money. We strive to provide a one-of-a-kind eco-luxury experience, and your feedback is invaluable in ensuring that our rates and inclusions align with the exceptional standards we set for ourselves. I will review our packages and inclusions to see where we might better enhance the overall guest experience.

Thank you again for choosing Jetwing Vil Uyana and for your constructive comments. We would be honored to welcome you back in the future, giving us another opportunity to exceed your expectations.

Nous avions choisi cet établissement pour son côté “éco-lodge” et l’observation des animaux, mais nous sommes restés un peu sur notre faim : pas de crocodiles ni de loutres aperçus durant notre séjour. À notre arrivée, on nous informe que les sorties nocturnes pour voir les Loris sont complètes… Heureusement, le personnel a trouvé une solution et nous avons eu la chance d’en voir un.

Côté restauration, la cuisine était correcte, mais rien d’exceptionnel pour un établissement de ce standing.

Le vrai point négatif reste le prix, que nous avons trouvé excessif par rapport à l’expérience globale. Si le cadre est splendide, le rapport qualité-prix n’est pas totalement justifié selon nous.

En résumé : un séjour agréable dans un environnement magnifique, mais une légère déception compte tenu des attentes et du tarif élevé.","Séjour en famille dans un cadre exceptionnel mais expérience mitigée par rapport au prix","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r1004081953-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

It was an absolute pleasure hosting you at the start of your Sri Lankan journey, and I am delighted to hear how much you enjoyed the luxurious harmony of nature and comfort at Jetwing Vil Uyana. I’m thrilled that your two-storey “Forest Dwelling” with its private pool and open courtyard provided a memorable blend of exotic wildlife encounters and intimate relaxation—eight-legged friends included!

Our design intentionally immerses guests in this unique eco-system, and I’m glad you appreciated the thoughtful layout of bath and bedroom facilities for both convenience and an authentic jungle experience. Thank you for your kind words about our à la carte breakfast and dinner offerings. Our culinary team takes great pride in crafting fresh, flavorful dishes, and it’s wonderful to know the service exceeded your expectations as well. I’ll be certain to share your compliments with them. 

I’m also pleased that you found the resort easily walkable around the lake and that our spa’s soothing massage added an extra layer of relaxation to your stay.

Thank you again for your glowing feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back whenever your travels bring you this way again.

Ayubowan! (May you live long)

They have a heated pool (it is impossible not to have a heated pool in this climate) available at any time of the day and a separate jacuzzi room which is included in the room reservation. 
The lawn is brilliant both in space and landscaping. It is very nice to have an afternoon tea and relax in the gardens.

I and my wife visited Westbury Palace for my wife's birthday. It became her best birthday ever.♥️🥰

We had a very warm welcome at the arrival and after the hotel tour we were escorted to our room. We were SURPRISED. We were upgraded to the HIGHEST room category of the palace. Robert London Suite. Room was very comfy, clean and spacious with a seating area by the heating place. And a nice chocolate platter was there in the room for us to enjoy. Swimming pool is heated. it was really good to enjoy outside in a cool climate. And once you are there don't forget to order some moktails or cocktails to sip while enjoying the pool. 

And we played billiord and moved for the dinner. DOUBLE SURPRISE..! Our butler Yaso and hotel team arranged us a ROMANTIC CANDLE LIGHT DINNER..Table decoration with friesh roses was very beautiful and food was very delicious. Importantly the food was really fresh and no artificial ingredients.

Then we could spend time at Sauna and Jacuzzi too..After the breakfast again SURPRISED..! Our butler Yaso and Hotel team arranged a Birthday cake for my wife to celebrate and to make the moment remebered. Baloons and flowers added more party vibe..🎂💐🎈

After the lunch we checked out. But this experience will be in our memory for life. 🥰♥️

Thank you Mr.Nihal, Residence manager for your incredible and warm hospitality.
Thank you Mr.Pushpakanth for all the support and communication since making the reservation.
And thank you Yaso, our butler for taking extra effort to make our stay more memorable and comfortable.
Thank you all the chefs for your mouth watering food.

The chalet  was clean and well equipped. The food was tasty and plentiful.
The surrounding atmosphere was so very peaceful and relaxing. The sound of the birds chirping in the morning was very pleasant.
What impressed us the most about the place was the service that was provided. There were two butlers assigned to our chalet, Shantha and Sameera. They did an excellent job of serving us. They went above and beyond their call of duty in performing their job.
The meals that were cooked by the two chefs, Iroshan and Ashen were very tasty.

It is truly an honour and a heartfelt privilege to read your beautiful words—and to welcome you back for your third visit in just six months. Guests like you are the very soul of Hilton Yala, and I cannot thank you enough for the trust, loyalty, and warmth you continue to show our team.

From the moment we first had the pleasure of hosting you, your passion for wildlife, eye for detail, and appreciation for Sri Lanka’s natural and cultural heritage have inspired us. Your vivid description of the premium villa, the bespoke amenities, and the experience of immersing in the buffer zone’s serene wilderness is deeply appreciated—and beautifully articulated. It is clear this place resonates with you on a very personal level, and that means the world to all of us.

Chef Jerome and his team will be overjoyed by your praise—he leads his culinary brigade with both passion and precision, and to know it has become a highlight of your visits is incredibly rewarding. Indika and the F&B team, our housekeeping and buggy associates, security colleagues including Chandima, and everyone across Front Office join me in thanking you for the special recognition.

Of course, your words for Sajith and the Ranger Team are especially meaningful. We all know your love for wildlife runs deep—and to hear that this visit brought four leopard sightings and rich wildlife encounters is thrilling. You are not just a guest to our Rangers; you are a kindred spirit in the field, and their respect for you is genuine and heartfelt.

The way you’ve described the fishing experience, dune walks, and bush walks captures what we hope every guest comes to understand—that Hilton Yala is more than a resort, it’s a place to reconnect with nature, self, and soul. The childlike wonder you described during the fishing trip brought a smile to all our faces.

As someone who knows Sri Lanka intimately and has seen the world, your praise means more than we can express. Thank you for recognizing the sincerity of Sri Lankan hospitality, and for letting us be part of your journey home, in every sense of the word.

We look forward to welcoming you back soon—with more wildlife, more stories, and many more memories to share.

With deepest gratitude and warmest regards,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Palatupana, Yala National Park 95000 Sri Lanka","Palatupana","Sri Lanka","95000",,,,"26194654","6.257097","Palatupana, Yala National Park","81.40043","Hilton Yala Resort","193","4.8","5","0","3","6","180","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3748686-d26194654-Reviews-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html","https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/kdwyahi-hilton-yala-resort/","2025-04-20","OTHER","5","Just book and go.

But as a keen life long wildlife enthusiast, the primary reason for my unswerving loyalty  is the     superb best in class skill, utterly amazing knowledge and client focus of the Ranger Team,  built, led and nurtured by Sajith, the Head Ranger.
This visit yielded four separate and breathtaking leopard sightings deep in the jungle in addition to several large and smaller mammal sightings, stunning variety of bird life (including endangered species) sightings and the various  rich eco-systems.
I also went on a fishing excursion that is offered,  that was absolutely fabulous and enjoyable (Ranger accompanied), appreciating the National Park from a very different perspective from the warm Indian Ocean,  spotting wildlife on the beach at dawn and subsequent childlike jubilation reeling in Trevally, Barracuda and other species while fighting to bring in King Mackerel (locally prized Seer).  Another couple of great experiences that are also offered are the Ranger accompanied Dune Walks and Bush Walks. These experiences will keep your senses on edge in a delightful way. Totally immersed in nature, as intended.
In context, my wife and I grew up in Sri Lanka and know the land of our birth. We are Americans and I have been extremely fortunate to travel to almost seventy countries with work and on holidays. 
Hilton Yala Resort embodies many facets of the best that Sri Lanka offers including extraordinary and legendary Sri Lankan hospitality and genuine friendliness.","Wonderful and Serendipitous Experiences!","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1003552178-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Thank you ever so much for your beautifully written review and for choosing to spend five nights with us at Hilton Yala.

We are truly delighted that your stay was filled with peace, connection to nature, and authentic Sri Lankan hospitality. It brings us immense joy to know you appreciated the architectural design, your private pool suite, and the serenity of our communal pool—a perfect way to unwind after an early morning safari.

Your kind words for our team, from Ms. Gitanjali and Chef Jerome to our waitstaff, spa therapists, buggy drivers, and housekeeping colleagues, mean the world to us. We are incredibly proud of the genuine warmth and attentiveness they bring to each guest interaction, and your recognition will be shared with great pride.

It was a pleasure having you with us during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations. Including our guests in these meaningful traditions is something we hold dear, and we’re thrilled that you enjoyed both the reverence and the joyful moments—especially “pin the eye on the elephant” 🐘!

Though the elusive leopard remained hidden this time, we're glad your personal safari with our ranger still offered memorable wildlife encounters. We hope there will be another opportunity for you to return and perhaps catch sight of one on your next visit.

Thank you once again for your generous recommendation and for making us a part of your Sri Lankan holiday memories. We look forward to welcoming you back to Hilton Yala for another unforgettable escape in the wild.

The large communal pool was a wonderful place to languish away the day after an early morning safari. 

All the hotel staff, from Gitanjali the General Manager, Jerome the head chef, our two beautiful waitresses,  the pool staff, the buggy drivers, the housekeeping staff and the two women in the spa who gave us super massages, could not have been more welcoming and friendly. They all took time to speak to us regularly in the kind and gentle nature of the Sri Lankan character. 

We felt honoured to be included in the hotel’s Sri Lankan New Year rituals and activities, mixing with hotel staff and some hotel guests. At times reverential and then some fun activities such as pin the eye of the elephant 🐘. 

Our Safari was very personal with just the two of us and our knowledgeable ranger.  We saw many fine examples of Sri Lankan wildlife, although we missed out on spotting a leopard, but that is in the nature of a safari and trying to spot an elusive wild cat such as this.

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We truly appreciate your kind words about our service and the safari experience, and we understand your perspective on the overall atmosphere.

As Hilton Yala is uniquely located inside the national park, guest safety is our top priority. The requirement for a ranger to access the beach and the use of buggies after dark are important safety measures due to the presence of wildlife in the area. These precautions ensure a secure and immersive experience while respecting the natural habitat surrounding us.

Regarding the safari experience, we recognize that Block 1 can get quite busy, especially during leopard sightings. For guests seeking a more tranquil and immersive experience, we often recommend exploring other areas such as Block 5, which offers breathtaking landscapes and abundant wildlife in a quieter setting.

We sincerely appreciate your constructive feedback and hope to welcome you again for another memorable stay, perhaps with a fresh perspective on the diverse and untamed beauty of Yala.

But the staff at the Hilton from top management to the wait staff and pool attendants were welcoming . We brought some friends with us and they too thoroughly enjoyed their stay.
I would avoid block 1 if possible. 
Kudos to the Hilton team. We have stayed in many a hotel from both coasts of the US to Australia , New Zealand , other parts of Asia . I would say by far this place exceeded our expectations.

Situated very close to Yala Park, hired Hilton’s guide and safari jeeps to visit the park and saw a leopard, elephants (many), wild buffalos, deer, samba, crocs, and many birds. There was a leopard sighting near the hotel and an elephant visited the hotel at night as there are corridors within the property for animals. So, don’t go for walks!

Rooms are cozy and large, the bed is very comfortable, well-stocked bar, etc.. please note “no room service” due to the animals that roam within the property.

What an amazing resort. The best hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka. It worth the price.

The welcome was amazing from the moment we stepped in. Monkeys were playing on the roof of the hotel.

Lobby is very modern with a view on the resort.

Bedroom is like a villa. Huge, very clean, comfortable. We had our own pool which was a little bit colder than the main pool but still very nice. 
Bathroom was the best part of the room. One of the biggest I have ever had. Very modern. 

Housekeeping did an amazing job making up our room twice a day, that was great because of the dust from the safaris.
Towels and toileteries were replenished twice a day.
Bottled water was complimentary.

The main pool was very warm and lovely. I loved it.

The restaurant was very well decorated. You can eat inside and outside. Both were great.
Food was very tasty, but more expensive than anywhere else in Sri Lanka. 
Breakfast and diner were both amazing.

We had a safari from another compagny than Hilton. They picked us up in front of the lobby and the hotel was very closed to the National Park.
There is no barrier between the park and the hotel (we saw an elephant very close to the hotel). That explains the few restrictions inside the hotel (no room service).

It's the first Hilton of this kind.
And it totally worth it.","Amazing experience !","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r995098915-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

The food at Hilton Yala, curated by Head Chef Jerome, was simply out of this world. Each dish was an absolute masterpiece, and we could not get enough!

We stayed in a Premium Pool Villa – which was nothing short of luxurious, providing us with every amenity we could ask for. The room was extremely spacious and provided us with great views. The private pool in the room truly elevated the experience, providing us with the perfect relaxation after a safari. 
I would definitely recommend Hilton Yala for anyone looking for the perfect luxurious get away!","A magical experience!!","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r992145452-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Ayurvedakur nach Sri Lanka ins das Garden Beach Ayurveda Resort. 
Einige Rezensionen aus dem Internet und vor allem die herausragende Betreuung der Ärztin Dr. Sandya Mendis, die ich bereits aus einem anderen Hotel kenne, haben mich dazu bewogen, dieses Hotel auszuwählen. 
Nun, am Ende der Kur kann ich kaum in Worte fassen, wie herausragend dieses Hotel wirklich ist. 
Die ärztliche Betreuung des Ärzteteams, zu dem auch 2 jüngere, sehr fähige Ärzte gehören, Frau Dr. Sewwandi und Herr Dr. Pandukha und wie oben schon angesprochen, Frau Dr. Sandya Mendis sind von allem was ich bisher in meinem Leben erlebt habe, unübertroffen. 
Hinzufügen möchte ich, dass ich mich seit 40 Jahren mit nichts anderem als Gesundheit und körperlicher Fitness beschäftige. 
Nirgends habe ich bisher soviel Liebe zum Detail, Wohlwollen, Kompetenz erfahren. 
Zeitdruck ist in diesem Hotel ein Fremdwort. 
Es ist keine Frage offen geblieben und das Kurergebnis lässt sich u.a. an meinem verbesserten Hautbild, besserem Schlaf und mehr innerer Ruhe erkennen. 

Jan, der Manager des Gästebereichs verfügt über ein Ayurveda Wissen, was nicht einfach angelesen ist. Jede meiner Fragen wird von ihm mehr als ausreichend beantwortet. Jan kommt aus der Praxis, auch für sich selbst lebt er eine ayurvedische Lebensweise. Er hat sich im Laufe mehrerer Jahrzehnte ein enormes Fachwissen angeeignet und dieses auch schriftlich festgehalten, um auf alle Fragen bestens vorbereitet zu sein und mir Hilfsmittel in schriftlicher Form mitgeben zu können. Egal welches Gemüse, welche Frucht, welche Kräuter, er weiß stets die Wirkung und kann Detailgenau sagen, ob es nun gut für mich ist, oder ob ich dieses oder jenes nur mäßig verzehren soll. 
Durch seinen längeren Aufenthalt in Deutschland sind ihm unsere Probleme mit Leistungsdruck, schneller, höher und weiter sowie Zeitdruck u.v.a. sehr wohl bekannt. 
Das macht es ihm möglich, sich in jeden Gast bzw. die Bedürfnisse eines jeden, hineinzuversetzen.    
Wer an historischem Wissen interessiert ist, findet in Jan ebenso einen kompetenten und interessanten Gesprächspartner. Die Gespräche mit ihm habe ich sehr genossen. 

Die Anwendungen werden von einem Therapeutenteam durchgeführt, welches über einen enormen Erfahrungsschatz verfügt. Liebevoll und stets bemüht für mich das richtige Maß zu finden, habe ich jede einzelne Behandlung sehr genossen. 
Hand- Kopf- und auch Fußbehandlungen kann ich direkt mit Meerblick, draußen im Garten genießen. 

Ich verbringe im Ayurveda Garden wirklich eine wunderbare, unvergessliche Zeit für meine körperliche und geistige Erholung. 

Was die Küche in diesem Hotel leistet, ist mit all meinen Erfahrungen ebenfalls unübertroffen. Detailgenau wird die Kost auf mich abgestimmt. Die kurzen Informationswege vom Ärzteteam und der Küche machen dies möglich. 
Liebevoll dekoriert, vom Gericht selbst, bis zur Tischdekoration, genieße ich jede Mahlzeit und spüre, wie bekömmlich und heilsam sie für mich ist. 

Einen herzlichen Dank möchte ich auch an alle richten, die im Hintergrund dieser Anlage arbeiten. 
Das Team an der Rezeption, der Yogalehrer, der Tai Chi Lehrer, der Gärtner, die Handwerker, Nalin der Tuc Tuc Fahrer, die Reinigungskräfte, die für die überaus sauberen und ordentlichen Zimmer zuständig sind, alle machen einen wunderbaren Job und haben mir unvergessliche 18 Tage im Ayurveda Garden beschert. 

Herzlichen Dank auch an die Leitung des Hotels, an Udyoga. Er hat mich bereits vor der Kur per mail bestens informiert und begleitet. Es ist ihm gelungen, in diesem Hotel ein Team zusammenzustellen, was in der Ayurvedaszene in Sri Lanka seines Gleichen sucht. Gerne komme ich wieder und lasse mich verwöhnen. 

Vielen vielen Dank an alle, für diese schöne Zeit.

Es ist ein kleines Resort direkt am Strand mit einem sehr schön angelegtem Garten und einem Pool. Im Garten kann man Streifenhörnchen, Krebse, Libellen und allerlei andere Tiere beobachten. Die Zimmer sind groß und sauber, alle mit Balkon und Meerblick. Die Mahlzeiten sind auf die individuellen Doshas abgestimmt und unheimlich lecker.

Im Resort gibt es drei Ayurveda-Arzte, die sehr genau und kompetent arbeiten und mit entsprechendem Feingefühl auf die einzelnen körperlichen, geistigen und seelischen Probleme eingehen. Man bekommt hier mindestens vier Behandlungen am Tag. Die Therapeutinnen und Therapeuten arbeiten sehr professionell und fragen während der Behandlung auch nach dem Wohlbefinden. Danke für die sehr gute ärztliche und therapeutische Betreuung!

Durch die geringe Anzahl der Zimmer und der Gäste ist man nicht irgendein Gast sondern wird als individueller Mensch wahrgenommen. Wünsche oder Bedürfnisse wurden jederzeit passend umgesetzt und möglich gemacht. Ganz gleich ob Manager oder Gärtner, Nachtsecurity oder Fahrer, Therapeuten oder Köche - ausnahmslos ALLE Mitarbeiter waren immer sehr offen, zugewandt, freundlich, respektvoll und herzlich! Danke für die vielen schönen und lustigen Momente!

Den Gästebetreuer Janaka, genannt Jan, möchte ich separat erwähnen. Er spricht fließend Deutsch und kann bei Arztkonsultationen und anderen Angelegenheiten übersetzen, falls es mal mit der englischen Kommunikation nicht genau funktioniert. Das war sehr hilfreich. Jan hat außerdem ein sehr breites Wissen über Ayurveda und die Geschichte, Kultur und Umgangsformen seines Landes. Wir haben im Innenhof viele interessante Gespräche geführt und ich konnte so einiges besser verstehen und dazulernen. Danke für den geistigen Austausch, Jan!

Ich hatte das Gefühl, Urlaub bei Freunden zu machen und bin erholt, aber mit schwerem Herzen abgereist. Irgendwann werde ich sicher wieder kommen. Bis dahin AYUBOWAN - ich wünsche euch allen ein langes Leben!","Dieses Ayurveda-Resort ist ein echter Geheimtipp!","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d11869487-r967677708-The_Garden_Beach_Ayurveda_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Das Hiru Garden Beach hat mich sehr beeindruckt. Schönes Resort im typischen Landesstil am indischen Meer, alle Zimmer mit Meerblick. 
Die Gastfreundlichkeit aller Mitarbeiter, immer lächelnd, jeder Wunsch wurde umgehend zur Zufriedenheit umgesetzt und  war Balsam für die Seele. Jeder Tag brachte eine neue Überraschung. Frühstück am Meer, im Garten oder im Yogapavillon am Meer. Zu Jeder Mahlzeit war der Tisch sehr schön mit Blumen geschmückt. Das Essen war hervorragend.  Alles war sehr sauber und gepflegt.
Zum Sonnenuntergang wurde spontan ein Tisch ans Meer gestellt, so dass man beim Abendessen einen wunderbaren, unvergesslichen Sonnenuntergang erleben konnte. Es wurde alles gemacht, damit man sich wohlfühlt.
Die professionelle und fürsorgliche Behandlung durch die Ärzte und Therapeuten waren für mich gesundheitlich ein Erfolg.
Besonders erwähnenswert ist Jan, der Gästebetreuer. Er nahm sich sehr viel Zeit, alles über Ayurveda und das Essen zu erklären. Er hat ein sehr gutes Wissen und ich habe durch ihn einiges wieder dazu gelernt. Er stand immer mit Rat und Tat zur Seite.
Ich würde jederzeit in der Hiru Beach Garden eine Kur machen.

Ein Pool zwar klein, aber ausreichend...Der Palmgarten-idyllisch!! Man konnte einfach nur da sitzen und das Schauspiel des Ozeanes beobachten. 
Die ayurvervedische Küche-sehr lecker und gesund.
Meiner Meinung nach fehlt in dem Resort Koch ein separater Ruhe bzw Empfangsraum für verschiedene Veranstaltungen.  Z. B Tanzabende, Yoga, oder Meditation!!!

Da mein Englisch sehr schlecht ist,
war einer der Kriterien der Auswahl
vom Hotel der deutschspachige
Übersetzer! Gerade die wichtige
Arztgespräche sollten doch in der
gleichen Sprache geführt werden.
Somit wurde das mir in diesem
Hotel versichert. Ich war auch
nicht entteuscht, sogar andersrum!
Der Manager Janaka (von uns Jan
genannt) hat mich sehr herzlich
empfangen. Führte mich auch in
Welt von Ayurveda ein. Viel erklärt
und natürlich das Programm der
Kur vorgestellt. In einem guten
Deutsch begleitete Jan mich/uns
die gesamte Zeit. Nicht nur das
Ayurveda, sondern auch das
Allgemeinwissen über das Land,
die Sitten, und vielem mehr hat
meinen Aufenthalt sichererer und
schöner gemacht! Er gab uns
Tipps über Einkaufsmöglichkeiten,
Verkehrsmittel, Ausflüge usw.
Ich hatte auch das Gefühl, dass Jan das ganze Konzept des Hauses im Griff hat und alles 
hervorragend  managt.

Besonders freut es uns, dass euch die kleinen Details – die Blumen, das Frühstück am Strand und die Neujahrsfeier im April – so berührt haben. Ein großes Dankeschön auch für die lieben Worte über unseren Jan – er ist wirklich ein Schatz, und wir sind glücklich, dass seine Unterstützung und sein Wissen eure Ayurveda-Reise bereichert haben.

wir wollen uns nochmals für die wunderschöne Zeit bei euch bedanken. 
Wir wurden von allen mit so viel Aufmerksamkeit und Freundlichkeit empfangen, 
wie wir das noch nie erlebt hatten. 
Es haben uns alle mit viel Herzblut und besondere Aufmerksamkeit betreut. Das ganze Team hat sich immer wieder etwas besonders einfallen lassen um unser Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu machen.
Ein paar Highlights waren, das Blütenmeer auf dem Zimmer oder beim Essen auf den Tischen, das Frühstück am Strand und auch das Neujahrfest, Mitte April, das wir mit allen Mitarbeiten und deren Familien mitfeiern durften. 
Das ist nicht selbstverständlich.

Einen ganz besonderen Dank gebührt dir lieber Jan,
für deine unermüdliche Hilfsbereitschaft in allen belangen, für deine Erklärungen über die Zusammenhänge von Ayurveda.
Bei jedem Essen hast du die Zutaten und Wirkungsweisen sehr gut erklärt.
Dank deiner ausführlichen schriftlichen Dokumentation über Gewürze und Nahrungsmittel und welches mit welchem Kombiniert werden darf und was nicht,
konnten wir hier zu hause vieles in den Alltag integrieren.
Durch deine Übersetzungen bei den Arztterminen war ein guter Dialog mit den Ärzten möglich.
Du bist die Seele des Hauses.

Many thanks for staying with us and for your helpful feedback

I am really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope to welcome you back again.

Please allow me to address some of the points you raised.

The huge bathtubs are hand-carved and so require a spinner type bath waste which may seem a little unfamiliar.  Sorry about that.

The ceiling fans are over 100 years old.  They are fully operational and refurbished but sometimes these old boys make a little groan now and again.  All our suites are fully air-conditioned for your comfort.

Our restaurant meals are cooked fresh to order and as we have a very large a la carte menu the chefs take care to create dishes specially for you and therefore takes a little time.  Although you don’t have to, we normally request in the evening your order in advance and for your convenience ask what time you wish to dine.  Obviously, something didn’t go to plan that evening and apologise for this.

It is our policy not to provide ironing equipment in the guest suites for safety reasons.  A hot iron could cause injury especially if there are children staying in the suite.  We have our own fully operational laundry and offer a pressing service should you have requested this.

Incredible place, tastefully decorated, excellent service, superb food. 

This place is a must visit if you want to drown yourself in complete serenity.

The combination of nature and a pleasing selection of decorative antiques with a calm and quiet environment just alters your state of mind.

The service, specially by Dino was exceptional. Every little need was looked into.

We had minor technical issues such as the tub drainage being stuck, the ceiling fan makes an irritable noise over a certain threshold and the TV being out of place, however that didn't bother us because we were there for a short stay. 

Just a few recommendations if this revreview makes it to the management,
Please cater to your guests needs rather the guests catering to the kitchens needs when it comes to pre ordering the meal. 
We had to confirm our dinner order by 5.30 and we were uncomfortable As we had to rush to dinner. 

The room was equipped with most essential appliances except for an iron and an ironing board. 
When called guest services, they said that they don't provide them either. 
For this reason, I had to wear wrinkled clothes throughout my stay. 

On checkout, we had to wait for approx 10 mins until someone showed up,  despite ringing the electric remote bell. 

Other than these little things, we had an excellent time. 

Thank you.

The food, it takes a good 30-45 mins to prepare but I wouldn't complaint! It was just heavenly! 
The only thing I would like to add is allowing us to use the pool for a small fare, since we are dining anyways and it was so inviting...

Once we stepped out of the car and started walking down this antique pathways & ponds with steps at intervals, we reached the reception which is directly connected to a huge coconut groves-land and that is in turn linked to the beach & ocean!

We were famished but there is this 1 main restaurant present and little did we know that the food and coffee served during our 5 day trip would make us smile. With filled and content bellies, we got to our room (on day 1) and were just amazed by the royal setup and feel of it. A jacuzzi with so much depth but blended with the naturality of the room and the resort and a room ceiling so high that a ladder could not help us reach it ;) The cleaniness of the room, the old meets the new school look and the size of the bath-room was so huge, we just landed up pampering ourselves and being in awe.
The resort overall is a private boutique and the style of it blended with the wooden and antiques setup really gave me goosebumps because I never felt so much at ease and suddenly I started warming up to the idea of forgetting everything negative in life.
The cherry on the cake is that it was just me - wife - staff. So the peace, much needed privacy (no noise pollution), quiet and friendliness of the staff (will never forget Malith + Dakshi + head chef) gave us the most needed break away from our very stressful work routines. I am focusing on the key fact that all this together made our stay in Reef Villa the best and the most memorable for us.

Thank you so much for giving us our idea of a getaway anniversary trip and we thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.

Kudos to you guys and will never forget this place and the memories created.","A Haven of it's own","2019-10","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r716991450-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

Viewed The Reef 5 years ago and made a vow we would visit this resort at some time.
Well it lived up to all our expectations and more. A truly unique & classical place, the best I have visited. 
Full of asian artifacts that adorn the property coupled with the splendour of the rooms that make this resort stand out against anything else.
The management & staff are of the finest we have encountered and strive to make your stay a memorable one, and it was. 
I was presented with a surprise birthday cake specially made by the chef, it was one of the best I have tasted, but then again all his dishes were of a high standard.
I wish I could remember all their names to thank them individually, nothing was too much trouble for this team.
We did meet ""Monica"" one day on the beach, she being an elephant. Some sadness in seeing her in a captive environment, but Mr Malith the resort manager assured me she is well taken care of. 
There are only seven rooms and we stayed in one of the Plantation House Suites with a  balcony and sea view. We did have the chance to view one of the garden rooms and found this to be splendid. Which ever room you choose it would be of similar opulence to the others at the Reef.
If you like dogs you will love Wilmer & Fred two gorgeous and well behaved golden retrievers who belong to the owners.
Do not miss the chance to visit this hidden jewel of Sri Lanka, you will not be disappointed. We hope to return.","Unique Splendour","2019-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499081-d1233956-r680811374-Reef_Villa_Spa-Wadduwa_Western_Province.html",

This stunning boutique hotel, housed in a restored colonial era building, sits right in the heart of Galle Fort, offering a perfect blend of history, style, and warmth.
 
The rooms are thoughtfully designed with a tasteful colonial-inspired aesthetic. I particularly loved the elegant décor, which maintained a sense of heritage while incorporating modern touches. The facilities were comfortable and well-maintained, ensuring a pleasant experience for every guest.
 
The staff were genuinely warm and welcoming, always going above and beyond to ensure we were well looked after. Special mention goes to their exceptional service and attention to detail. The food was of high quality fresh, flavourful, and beautifully presented. I have to say, their chicken biriyani was a standout dish that I absolutely loved.
 
I had visited this property on previous occasions as well, and each visit has been memorable. The evening vibe at their open restaurant is simply magical, making it the perfect spot for a cosy dinner amidst the fort’s atmospheric surroundings.

The hotel is situated in the historic walled fort – a few moments’ walk from the ancient ramparts and the iconic light house. Nearby are numerous restaurants, cafes, bars, souvenir and craft shops. More shops and services, the train and bus station can be found in the “new” town

A number of pictures of the hotel can be seen on Google Street View.
 
Reception – Being greeted at the hotel entrance (by name) gave an immediate good impression as did the flawless check in with choice of welcome drink and ice cold towel. Staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful

Public Areas/Decor – Whilst the public areas have welcoming contemporary furniture and décor care has been taken to ensure the hotel retains a colonial feel including wooden staircases, external walkways and balconies overlooking Pedlar Street below

Guest Room –Small – but perfectly formed with great consideration given to layout, design and furnishing. Everything worked well and it was comfortable. An immaculate shower room. In room mini fridge, tea and coffee making etc. A small private balcony with seating overlooking the street below

Amenities including Entertainment – Large flat screen TV with a limited number of channels. Ample electrical sockets. Free WiFi was very good

Lighting – A variety of lighting options
 
Air Conditioning – Very good including ceiling fan

Noise – Despite live entertainment on the night I was there I was not disturbed by any noise

Food & Beverage – I opted to have dinner at one of the many local restaurants nearby. The buffet breakfast was probably one of the best I had during my time in Sri Lanka. Everything served like a “picture on a plate”. Even the coffee was freshly brewed.
 
Value for Money – For the quality of the accommodation and high level of service I was very satisfied with the room rate which included the excellent breakfast

X Factor – The location of the hotel in the centre of the historic fort means that it is easy to explore the area on foot. In addition, staying there means that it’s possible to experience the true ambience of the fort once the hordes of day trippers have left or before they arrive!

During my stay in Sri Lanka I made use of the services of Kulansa Tours who I have relied on in the past for airport transfers and island wide sightseeing on and off the usual tourist trail.

Thank you for sharing your thoughtful feedback and for choosing to return to Jetwing Vil Uyana not once, but three times.

We also appreciate your kind words about our dedicated team, whose friendly and efficient service is central to creating a memorable stay.

This is our first trip to Sri Lanka and what a wonderful start.  This eco friendly hotel is simply wonderful, serene, quiet and restful. The hotel and staff were absolutely amazing especially Dissa (Dissanayake) who was assigned to look after us during our stay.  No ask( big or small) was too much for him.

We loved the closeness to nature, the outdoor shower was great fun to use and we even had our own resident peacock in the  garden patio. 

Excellent naturalist at the hotel too.  Very knowledgeable about Sri Lankan wildlife. Joined him on the night time loris trail. Sadly no sightings for us although other guests had been lucky on previous days!! 

Food was delicious, both International and Sri Lankan cuisines, and a huge thank you to the teams in the kitchen and front of house.","Great hotel in the midst of nature …","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r997539256-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",

Lots of birds (and cicadas after rains), troops of monkeys and other small animals are around, specially in the mornings. Lots of big trees and a tree house to sit and chill in above the green canopy. The paddy field was brown and awaiting planting at the time we visited, which was the only downer. 
Service is top class, very attentive and courteous staff. Food is delicious and plentiful. It is very relaxing to sit on the spacious balcony outside the room overlooking all the greenery and have meals served. Jetwing Lighthouse is about 800m walk away and we went there to use the gym and spa.

Thank you so much for your fantastic review! We’re so glad to hear that you enjoyed the peaceful, secluded location while still being close to everything you needed.

Not many distractions other than lots of birds chirping away and a pack of large monkeys crossing the premises twice a day. The monkeys keep to themselves and seem very scared of the humans. The food is lovely and the butler allocated to you makes sure that you are looked after very well. The light house hotel is walking distance and I used it for my gym work out.

The rooms are always beautifully clean and well-maintained. We especially love staying in the Signature Room with a stunning sea view – waking up to the ocean is pure bliss. 🌊🛏️

The housekeeping team is always efficient, friendly, and incredibly accommodating, and we find all the staff – from front desk to room service – to be warm, helpful, and professional. Their hospitality is truly unmatched.

Breakfast is another highlight – there's so much variety and flavor, it’s the perfect way to start the day. 🍳🥐☕

In the evenings, we love unwinding at the Sunset Bar – the view is breathtaking and it’s the perfect spot to enjoy a drink as the sun sets. 🌅🍹 And for a cosy, laid-back vibe, Floatz Pub on the 9th floor is a great place to relax and enjoy the night. 🍻🎶

From the beautiful rooms, stunning views, and top-notch facilities to the consistently friendly and accommodating staff, Marino Beach Colombo never fails to impress.

We had a wonderful stay at Marino beach hotel in Colombo. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with genuine warmth and kindness. The staff, especially in the restaurant area, were incredibly friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home throughout our stay.
The large infinity pool area was a highlight—beautifully maintained and perfect for relaxing while enjoying the peaceful, calm surroundings. The serene environment added to the overall experience, making it the ideal place to unwind and recharge. 

What made our experience even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff — they surprised us with a delicious cake for our anniversary. It was such a warm and personal touch that made us feel truly celebrated.

The ambiance is so fresh and breathable, giving you the space to just sit back and enjoy your meal 🍃✨.

The staff? Absolutely wonderful! They are super friendly and attentive, which just adds to the overall positive vibe of the place 😊. Now, let’s talk about the food – top-notch in every sense! Every dish I’ve tried so far has been incredible. My favorite drink? Definitely the Blue Curacao Mojito 🍸, refreshing and just the right amount of sweet. The Passion Fruit Juice 🥤 is also a great pick, full of flavor and freshness.

For food, we sampled the Chicken Wings 🍗, Cheese Pasta 🧀🍝, and Potato Chips 🍟 – all served beautifully and bursting with taste. The flavors are rich, and each dish feels carefully crafted. And don’t even get me started on their cheesecakes! 🍰 We tried them in multiple flavors, and they were all heavenly.

I’m already looking forward to my next visit when I’m in Galle Fort again. Truly, the calm and serene atmosphere is what makes The Merchant stand out.

We stayed for 2 night and ate in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  The food was served rather than buffet which was a pleasant change and was plentiful and very good.  We found the staff here really nice, friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel is great for exploring being right in the centre of Galle Fort.

Luckily, we found rooms on Booking.com at this property and quickly booked, and wow, what a tremendous hotel.

Upon arrival and throughout the service was spectacular, nothing was too much trouble. 

The room was beautifully decorated with everything you could need for a short or long stay, they have worked hard to keep a colonial feel without compromising on modern amenities, and they do it so well!

The food both at the bar, restaurant and room service were extraordinary, some of the best cuisine I’ve had in Sri Lanka - would definitely recommend the Biriani for dinner, or the tuna steak for lunch.

Cocktails and juices were very well made, and unique in taste, again some of the best in Sri Lanka.

The breakfast was very tasty, with a full range of options to suit all, without compromising on quality.

Thank you to all the staff, and to the owners -
Keep doing what you’re doing, as you do it so well!

This was the last hotel on our Sri Lanka tour and the service was comfortably on a par with the best we experienced throughout our tour.  Thanks to Amaan who gave us our wake up call and helped with cases at an ungodly hour...

We ate dinner in the hotel and the food was superb.  Both Sri Lankan and Western dishes were perfectly cooked (try the locally caught white bait) and whilst the restaurant was busy, the atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable.

Отель располагается на большой зеленой территории, что создает атмосферу спокойствия и уединения. Здесь приятно гулять, наслаждаясь природой и свежим воздухом. Нереальные закаты, очень красивая природа. Эстетика в каждом уголке отеля. 

Номера в отеле очень уютные и чистые. Каждый день проводилась уборка, меняли полотенца и постельное белье, что создавало ощущение комфорта и заботы.

Особенно хочется отметить сотрудников ресторана Karthik (ass F&BManager)
и сотрудника ресепшена Farhan (front office executive) которые были невероятно дружелюбны и внимательны. Они всегда готовы помочь и сделать ваш отдых максимально приятным.

Питание в отеле разнообразное и вкусное. Каждый день предлагали новые блюда, и мы всегда находили что-то по своему вкусу. 
Еда бывает очень острая. 
Завтраки особенно понравились — свежие фрукты, выпечка и различные горячие блюда.
Вкусные морепродукты на ужин.

Единственный минус, с которым мы столкнулись, — это задержка нашего трансфера в аэропорт. Гид не выходил на связь, и это немного омрачило финал нашего отдыха. Проблему решили и мы успели доехать.  

В целом, я рекомендую ""Sun Siyam Pasikudah"" для тех, кто ищет спокойный и расслабляющий отдых. Учтите, что дорога от аэропорта занимает время, но это того стоит!","Самый эстетичный отель в Пасикуда🏝️","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d7146014-r990257097-Sun_Siyam_Pasikudah-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",

Питание в отеле просто потрясающее! Мы пробовали разнообразные блюда местной кухни, готовьтесь к тому что будет остро.

 Мы посетили несколько местных достопримечательностей и остались в полном восторге от красоты природы и культуры Шри-Ланки.

There are no hotel type blocks with many rooms in a row (we had first booked Uga Bay, the top rated hotel in the area, but changed as Uga Bay has four rooms in a block, while Sun Siyam is just one on a floor, in a two floor villa).

The pool is well maintained and a coral ridge creates a large shallow area of the sea where water doesn't go above waist high (you can check this in Google satellite view).

Two minor cribs:
1. Breakfast was too repetitive, though once I pointed it out, they fixed it for the third day we were there
2. They are too nice to some guests who are not playing by the rules - a couple in the pool was smoking by the edge of the pool, and staff were unwilling to request them to stop.

Clearly one of the best resorts in Sri Lanka the only one of a kind high end resort attached to an international brand like Hilton. This is a beautifully designed high end property located in the YALA national park buffer zone. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. In this resort the executive chef Tissera had a carefully crafted menu which appealed to our palate whilst retaining the identity of Sri Lankan food. He and the sous chef Majid were very gracious to source lake prawns as it was my desire to eat this dish before leaving the island and they went over and beyond to source it for us. NO was not in the vocabulary at this hotel and chef Tissera was no exception. It is nice to see more Hilton properties pop in the island.A special mention about the GM Githanjalee who personally intervened to  ensure we had a pleasant stay. Special mention of Indika who was extremely pleasant and went over beyond to accommodate us.

We can’t properly express our immense gratitude for the Yala Resort team and the incredible treatment that made our trip spectacular. 

I’m a very detailed planner, and had no idea how absolutely inclusive and five star this property was until we arrived. The check in process was so breezy with a gorgeous upgraded villa, and the staff gave us such a warm welcome overseen by an obvious pro, Vino, the front desk manager. Asela always had a buggy ready to take us to our room and always ensured we were having whatever we needed for our stay - his smile was infectious!

Our villa had a private pool in the jungle with the ocean in the background and had every thoughtful amenity you could imagine. The property is only a year old so it is perfectly clean and divine. Beautiful lighting, makeup mirrors, a deep soaking tub, a pillow menu for whatever your needs require, umbrellas, and technology for anything you need. Cushy towels, nice robes, slippers, flip flops, bath salts, and the most expensive and technologically advanced toilet I’ve ever seen. Our housekeeping staff, Tharidu and Kasun were genuinely wanting to ensure we had everything we needed everyday and kept our room spotless and comfy all day long. The property is also plastic free which we absolutely loved and respected. Even the room keys are wood and they are leading the way with sustainability efforts. The resort pool is gorgeous and plenty of room for privacy, especially since there’s only 42 rooms here. Very exclusive vibe and personalized service. 

We pre booked 6 days worth of safaris and were lucky enough to be with our expert guide, Pazindu, and safari driving expert, Thushara every day. Getting to know these guys and know we were in good hands made us feel safe and excited to learn about Sri Lankan culture nature every day. It was really important to us to respect nature and the environment instead of the normal side of the road guys racing through the park to get a good look at whatever was there. These guys took us to remote areas, found us beautiful birds, rare sightings, elephants, leopards, and jackals and ensured we even picked up local spot experts who knew even more- to share facts, conservation work, and migration patterns of the birds that they were thrilled to see alongside us. Instead of a driver just taking you for a ride - you have a driver and a personal guide sitting with you to spot animals and take pictures for you so you can just enjoy the experience and live in the moment. They had rain jackets, coconut water, more snacks than you could ever need, and bincoulars - you literally don’t need to bring anything. We did a beach walk, dune walk, Block 1, 5, 6, Bundala Park, and Sithulpawwa. All so beautiful and different ways to see and experience culture and nature. 

The icing on the cake was Chef Jerome and his staff in the kitchen. Some of the absolute best food we’ve had in years. Beautiful presentations, local ingredients, and flavors that remind you how food should taste. He encouraged us to order off menu and took our requests and preferences into consideration when making us personalized meals. We’re so lucky to have eaten his food for a week and we’ll be chasing those flavors forever. Chanaka, Dilanka, and Indika made our meals special with fantastic service and genuine interest in making sure we had a great experience. One of the days we booked the full day safari with bush banquet - although expensive it is absolutely worth every penny - Hiran and the entire team cooked us the best meal in the middle of a jungle. It’s a must do! 

There’s nothing I would change about this property (except maybe Netflix streaming on the tv since i normally fall asleep to old favorite shows). Truly a spectacular once in a lifetime experience to feel so welcomed by this team - THANK YOU everyone who made us feel like family.","Spectacular In Every Way","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r985649450-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

very nice pool, rooms - very practical and with all amenities
Spa was very inviting and nicely built in a very spacious building and it has a good atmosphere - it also has all other amenities - e.g. steam room, sauna, gym 
Organized Safari was quite good. 

Observations 
Staff were quite ok, wth few outstanding ones. The most outstanding employee was Mr Isuru at the main restaurant, who was very much ahead of others and one of the best that I have met  at a restaurant. Others worth mentioning were Sahastra and Prabuddha. Also, the Ranger, Praneeth, who accompanied us on the Safari
The beach is not good,unlike at Uga Chena Huts.

Not so at Hilton Yala. You find caring and thoughtful staff in every aspect of your experience from Vino (all requests were met with kindness and promptness), who is the front desk manager to Hashini in dining (her smile never fades) to Pasindu who is the ranger (his enthusiasm never wanes) and the overall service experience feels very different than other resorts we have experienced in Sri Lanka. 

The rangers are a true highlight. We are frequent travelers to South Africa and it is hard to beat a safari in Kruger, but thanks to the rangers (with Sajith leading) here who are trained in South Africa, you walk away with a better sense and appreciation of the flora and fauna of Sri Lanka. The safari experience here is different in that it is a lot denser in terms of traffic etc., but the landscape is stunning and unique and worth doing for sure. 

If you have a chance, stay at the premium villa with pool. It is indeed a beautiful villa for a safari experience.

The rooms are technologically advanced (motorized shades, auto toilet seat covers/bidet, a lot of outlets, great mood lighting, etc). We booked a morning safari through hotel and it was fun. Sunset on the beach at hotel was beautiful. Spent a full day lounging around our private pool (we had a premium pool villa) and the main hotel pool (perfect water temperature) and the service was great. There is a small heated children’s pool as well. Very good security, including mirror checks under vehicles upon arrival and multiple 24-hour guards in towers near the beach to watch for intruders (animals and people). Can’t imagine a more perfect place to stay in Yala.

Thank you so much for your kind words and for taking the time to share such a detailed and thoughtful review of your stay with us at Hilton Yala. Reading about your experience truly made our day!

It was an absolute pleasure to welcome you, and we’re thrilled to hear that from the moment you arrived, you felt at home. Your appreciation for the little details, from the safety briefing with our rangers to the playful monkeys swinging through the trees, encapsulates the unique charm of our location.

We’re delighted to know that you found your room perfect—your mention of the smart toilet and gel pillow made us smile! It’s always wonderful to hear when our guests embrace and enjoy the finer touches.

A special thank you for highlighting your safaris with Sam; he’ll be so pleased to know his balance of knowledge and silence made your wildlife adventures memorable. Your recommendation of the afternoon safari will surely inspire future guests.

Your glowing compliments about the dining experience and our chef’s diligence are truly appreciated. I’ll be sure to pass along your praises to Dilanka and the team. They’ll be so happy to know their efforts brought a smile to your face.

We couldn’t agree more that a visit to the spa is the perfect way to complete a stay. It’s wonderful to hear that your contour facial felt like pure bliss—our spa team will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed it.

On behalf of myself and the entire team, thank you for choosing Hilton Yala. Your lovely words reaffirm our commitment to creating unforgettable experiences for our guests. We can’t wait to welcome you back for another safari adventure or simply to relax and unwind in the beauty of Yala.

- personally, we found the afternoon safari better than the morning one 
- talk to the head chef, he’s a genius",,,,,,,,,,,,,"From the second we arrived at the Hilton we were warmly welcomed and actually a bit stunned by how beautiful the hotel was. 

After a safety briefing by the rangers monkeys came swinging along the trees really making it feel like a safari adventure. 

The rooms were perfect, I’m not embarrassed to say that the smart toilet with the heated seat was a winner! I highly advise getting the gel pillow off the menu for the best nights sleep. 

We did two safaris with our lovely ranger Sam. He was very knowledgable but didn’t overwhelm the tour of Block 1 with non stop chatting. We did both a morning and afternoon excursion - I would personally recommend the afternoon as we saw a lot more wildlife. 

The quality of food during our stay was second to none, the head chef was diligent and personalised every meal to your taste. You must ask for his green beans tossed in garlic butter. For breakfast you can have eggs literally anyway you can think of - ‘Eggs on the Beach’ were really quite special. I loved how Sri Lanka was at the heart of the menu and we were able to try so many traditional dishes that were all spectacular. It probably helps that our waiter Dilanka served everything with a smile and was very charming! 

To finish off the perfect stay a trip to the spa is a must. The treatment rooms feel like they’re in the middle of the wild. We had the contour facial that was 90 minutes of bliss. 

We just wanted to say a massive thank you to Vino and his team for such a marvellous stay 🤍","A glimpse of paradise!","2024-11","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r983014849-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

From start to finish, my experience was nothing short of extraordinary.

Pre-Arrival and Welcome
Shortly after booking, I received an email from my personal assistant at the front desk, who provided all the relevant details for my stay. Their attentiveness ensured a seamless transfer to the property, leaving me stress-free and ready to relax. Upon arrival, the front desk team greeted me warmly, making me feel instantly at home.

Located in the heart of the Yala Jungle, and just a 15-minute drive from the renowned Yala National Park, the hotel offers an ideal base for those seeking adventure and wildlife exploration. The check-in process includes a security briefing by a knowledgeable ranger, which is both informative and reassuring, given the presence of wildlife such as elephants and a crocodile near the bio pond. The hotel’s private beach is equally adventurous and requires accompaniment by a ranger due to the possibility of encountering wild animals.

The Villas: A Luxurious Oasis in the Jungle
Transfers to the villas are done via buggy, adding to the exclusive feel of the experience. The villas themselves are a masterpiece of luxury – beautifully designed, private, and equipped with everything you could need, including a private pool and sun deck. As a Diamond Member, I was twice upgraded to one of the finest villas, a gesture that truly elevated my stay.

Inside the villa, I found thoughtful amenities like a Nespresso machine, tea pods, a minibar, a safe, and even guest flip-flops. Housekeeping did a phenomenal job keeping the space spotless and ensuring that no jungle creatures ventured indoors. My villa was in pristine condition, and everything worked flawlessly, as if brand new.

One morning, I even had a visit from a monitor lizard sunbathing on my terrace – a unique reminder of the hotel’s extraordinary location.

Dining: A Culinary Adventure
The dining experience at Hilton Yala was nothing short of exceptional. Every evening, the chef personally greeted guests, offering personalized recommendations based on the freshest local ingredients. The service staff were equally impressive – knowledgeable about the menu and always eager to ensure a memorable dining experience.

The menu is thoughtfully curated, emphasizing local flavors rather than imported options, which I deeply appreciated. For example, fresh local shrimp takes center stage instead of frozen salmon flown in from abroad. The presentation and taste of every dish were impeccable, and the wine menu catered to a wide range of preferences.

A standout touch was the homemade ice cream and sorbets, which were simply divine.

On my birthday, the staff went above and beyond, singing Happy Birthday, serving a delicious cake, and offering a glass of champagne. The front desk manager also presented me with a handwritten birthday card, making me feel truly special – like part of a family.

Facilities and Activities
The main infinity pool is a highlight of the property, impeccably maintained and offering stunning views. The pool team cleans it daily and also attends to the private pools.

The spa is another must-visit, offering a variety of treatments in a serene and clean environment. The massage I received was incredibly relaxing, and the staff’s friendliness added to the experience.

Hospitality at its Finest
What truly sets Hilton Yala apart is its unparalleled hospitality. Every team member, from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, goes above and beyond to make you feel valued and cared for. The warmth, attentiveness, and genuine desire to fulfill every guest's wish is hospitality on a grand scale – a level rarely experienced, even at luxury properties.

Commitment to Sustainability
One of the most impressive aspects of Hilton Yala is its commitment to sustainability. The resort actively minimizes its environmental impact by using locally sourced ingredients in its cuisine, reducing waste, and promoting eco-friendly practices throughout the property. From the use of renewable resources to supporting the local community, every detail reflects a dedication to preserving the pristine environment of the Yala Jungle.

Overall Experience
Hilton Yala is not just a hotel; it’s an unforgettable experience. The combination of unparalleled luxury, exceptional hospitality, and the thrill of being surrounded by nature makes it one of the top Hilton properties I have ever visited.

Whether you’re looking for a luxurious base for your safari or a peaceful retreat with a touch of adventure, Hilton Yala delivers on every front. The entire team’s dedication to creating a perfect stay ensures that you’ll leave with memories to last a lifetime.

I cannot recommend this property highly enough – it’s truly at an LXR Luxury level and worth every moment. Knowing that your stay supports sustainable tourism and experiencing hospitality on such a grand level makes it all the more rewarding.","Hilton Yala Hotel: A Hidden Gem in the Jungle with Unmatched Luxury, Hospitality, and Sustainability","2024-11","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r980613322-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",

Es ging los mit einem herzlicher Empfang durch Jan, den sehr gut deutsch sprechenden Gästebetreuer, der sich viel Zeit nahm, alles Wichtige zu erklären. Dann war Mittagessen-Zeit und an einem langen Tisch hatte ich Gelegenheit, die anderen Gäste kennen zu lernen. Die Atmosphäre ist sehr familiär und man fühlt sich von Anfang an richtig wohl.  Mein Zimmer mit Balkon war im 3. Stock mit herrlichem Blick in den gepflegten Garten und auf das Meer. Das Rauschen der Wellen ist ein ständiger Begleiter und lässt einen Nachts sehr gut schlafen. Nach der Erstkonsultation mit der Ayourveda-Ärztin (auf Wunsch dolmetscht Jan) wird eine individuelle Medikation und ein Essensplan festgelegt. Generell ist anzumerken, dass man auch ohne oder wenig Englischkenntnissen wunderbar zurecht kommt. Alle Gäste kamen aus Deutschland und bei Bedarf ist Jan zur Stelle. Jeden Tag gab es vier Anwendungen. Die Masseur*innen sind sehr freundlich und verstehen ihr Handwerk. Stirnguss, Peeling, Schwitzkasten, Kräuterbad sind weitere Highlights, ebenso Yoga und Qigong in der Früh bei Sonnenaufgang auf einer überdachten Terrasse mit Blick auf das Meer. Ein frühmorgendlicher Ausflug mit dem Boot noch vor Sonnenaufgang in die Lagunen des Madu-River ist weiterhin sehr empfehlenswert. Danke auch an Nalin, der mit dem TukTuk Gäste auf Wunsch zum Wochenmarkt oder zum Shoppen in einen Teeladen/Gewürzladen fährt.

Lieber Gast,
vielen Dank für Ihre herzerwärmende Bewertung! Es freut uns sehr, dass Sie das Garden Beach Ayurveda Resort als eine „Perle mit viel menschlicher Güte“ empfunden haben.

Wir freuen uns, dass Ihnen unsere Lage am Strand, der schöne Garten und die Möglichkeit, mit anderen Gästen zu essen und Gespräche zu führen, gefallen haben. Unser Team ist immer bestrebt, mehr als das Übliche zu tun, sei es bei der Anpassung an besondere Ernährungsbedürfnisse, beim Angebot von Heilbehandlungen oder bei der Verfeinerung jeder Mahlzeit mit einer liebevollen Note.
Janaka und das gesamte Team sind überglücklich zu wissen, dass Sie nicht nur als Gäste, sondern als Freunde gegangen sind. Wir freuen uns darauf, Sie für weitere besondere Momente wieder bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen!

Die Lage direkt am Strand und der liebevoll gepflegte Garten verleihen äußerlich dem Hotel ein tolles Ambiente.
Ganz herausragend wurde unser Aufenthalt dort wegen der besonderen Freundlichkeit und Zugewandheit der Hotel-Mitarbeiter. Es ist nicht aufgesetzt, sondern kommt von Herzen. Egal, ob es das Eingehen auf die nicht-ayurvedischen Essenswünsche unserer Kinder war oder die Beantwortung vieler Fragen, das Schmücken des Essenstisches....
Auch die Masseurinnen und Masseure geben alles, um mit ihren wundervollen Behandlungen Verspannungen zu lösen.
Zum Konzept gehört, dass die Gäste gemeinsam an einem Tisch essen, um miteinander ins Gespräch zu kommen. Manchmal wird auch draußen mit Meerblick aufgetischt.
Abgerundet wird alles mit dem morgendlichen Yoga mit Meerblick.

Der Leiter des Hotel, Janaka, hat hier mit viel Fingerspitzengefühl etwas geschaffen, was man durchaus als Perle bezeichnen kann. Wir sind als Gäste gekommen und als Freunde gegangen!

Ein familiär geführtes Haus, man kommt als Gast und geht als Freund, tatsächlich.
Die Mitarbeiter sind absolut liebenswürdig und schaffen eine durchweg äusserst positive Atmospähre und kein Wunsch bleibt unerfüllt.
Ausflüge jeglicher Art können geplant werden, der Anwendungsplan wird von den Ärzten drumherum gestaltet, sodaß keine der Anwendungen verloren geht. Es gab zur Unterhaltung abendliche Besuche von Sitar-Spielern, Mönchen, das morgendliche Yoga war sehr gut.
Es gab gleich 2 Ärzte, die sich liebevoll um uns kümmerten, auf unsere Doshas abgestimmtes, sehr leckeres und phantasievoll dekoriertes Essen.
Gleich 4 Anwendungen pro Tag, wir haben bereits einige Aryuveda-Kuren hinter uns, so eine intensive bisher jedoch noch nicht.
Die Krönung des Ganzen ist Janaka, für uns ""Doctor Aryuveda"", ein deutschsprechender Kur-Manager, der uns unerschöpflich alles, was wir über Aryuveda wissen wollten, erklären konnte. Bei fast jeder Mahlzeit wurden die einzelnen Gemüse etc. von ihm erläutert und häufig auch in ihrem ""Rohzustand"" gezeigt. Durch seine Deutschkenntnisse waren auch Mißverständnisse bei den ärztlichen Konsultationen ausgeschlossen, das war äusserst hilfreich für uns und auch das für eine Kur einzigartig.
Das Haus liegt unmittelbar am Meer, hat einen kleinen, aber gepflegten Garten und einen spektaktulären Blick auf den indischen Ozean.
Links und rechts ist es ""ruhig"", einsame Strandspaziergänge sind möglich. Schwimmen ist aufgrund der sehr starken Strömung nicht wirklich möglich, aber mit den Wellen toben reicht ja auch. Im Garten gibt es sonst einen kleinen Pool, der für einige Schwimmzüge ausreicht.
Das Haus ist mit sehr vielen liebevollen Details eingerichtet, unser Zimmer hat uns gut gefallen, wurde täglich mit Blumen geschmückt und das Moskitonetz jeden Tag ausgebreitet.  Es gibt insgesamt nur 10 Zimmer.
Wer jedoch Wert auf perfekt lackierte Fußleisten und millimetergenau schließende Fenster etc. legt, ist hier nicht wirklich gut aufgehoben. Das Haus ist ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen und auch die Lage direkt am Meer und der halbjährliche heftige Monsun machen den Erhalt von Gebäuden nicht einfach. Gerne kommen wir wieder an diesen besonderen Ort.","Ein besonders schöner Aryuveda-Urlaub","2023-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d11869487-r921060121-The_Garden_Beach_Ayurveda_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Garden beach Ayurveda resort Team!
In February 2023 I had an unbelievable time there, everything was above expectations. I was so welcomed even before my trip by a management of the resort, who provided the best quality and with highest respect a service in booking, explanations of details of my stay and preparation activities before my  arrival.
My trip from an airport to the Resort was well organized, very comfortable and pleasant.
Despite of my early morning arrival to the resort I was so warmly welcomed by employees, who presented me a wonderful necklace made of flowers. My luggage was immediately brought to my lovely room, housekeeping employer represented me a room and explained about everything. His smile and positive attitude made me feel as at home immediately. My room was always super clean and beautifully decorated by flowers and funny figures made from towels 😊
A few hours later I was welcomed by office manager who has extraordinary knowledge about Ayurveda life style and Sri-Lanka. His high respectful way of working and easy personal talks made me feel like I am a special guest. Based on my wishes special unique tours to Sri-Lanka famous pales were organized for me, without interruption of my treatment plan. Office manager also  during all days provided great presentations / explanations of Ayurveda cuisine, providing a lot of information about  usefulness of each single food item.
Doctors of the resort are highly professional, they create miracles not only in improving of body health conditions but also in improving of mental wellbeing. After a few days of treatment with a lot of massages and relaxation I felt myself as newly born and absolutely happy person, my health issues slowly disappeared and even after weeks of my vacation I feel good and highly motivated to keep a happy and healthy life style.
Ayurveda treatment team all together and each separately creates miracles while doing different kinds of massage treatment. Again I could feel a lot of respect towards me, a lot of attention to personal needs and requests during massage, as of course welcoming and smiling attitude created unbelievable results out of treatments.
One more important part of Ayurveda treatment is high quality special healthy food, which was done on fantastic level with personal approach to individual health conditions and special wishes. A service during the meals was fantastic! Some breakfast, lunches, dinners were organized outside in the ocean coast or in the garden, tables were beautifully decorated. Every day 3 times per day I personally could feel a care and attention of restaurant service guys.
The resort is located directly on ocean coast and surrounded by a very nice garden, which is under care of a gardener, who brings wonderful flowers to the guests and knows a lot about ocean and turtles.
In general, Garden beach Ayurveda resort is an cozy place with perfect management, high professional doctors and treatment team, very caring kitchen and restaurant as well as housekeeping employees and of course wonderful people-guests!
I definitely would like to come back and wish everyone to have the same experience as I had.
Be healthy and happy!
Best regards,
Svetlana","Colorful calm paradise! ☀️🌴","2023-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g499082-d11869487-r881022052-The_Garden_Beach_Ayurveda_Resort-Kosgoda_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Als einzigen negativen Punkt gebe ich das alte Equipment an, das hier zum Schulen verwendet wird. Mein Lehrer war durchaus kompetent und ich habe viel gelernt.

Это два отеля объединенных одним названием, ресторан был в waves, все жильцы могли пользоваться обеими территориями.
Кормили вкусно, брали только завтраки, еда немного специфична, не Турция, но нам было хорошо. Отель не самый близкий ко всем локациям но и не далеко, везде реально дойти пешком, изучили весь район от и до, много пользовались местными автобусами, вообще топ) нас там за местных считали уже) 
В номере просторно, все предоставляли когда в этом была необходимость, персонал душки, все приятные, постоянно улыбаются и здороваются. В отеле раз в неделю проходили представления, фаер шоу 
Тихо спокойно, с заднего двора всегда смотрели на павлинов по утрам))
Главный менеджер (лысый парень:) очень приятный, с ним было легко поддерживать общение, все мальчики ребята, девочки на ресепшене приветливые и дружелюбные.
Много интернациональных туристов ну и россиян)
Проблем никаких не было, все было хорошо, отдых удался!
Спасибо за отдых, нам очень понравилось, сейчас вспоминаю и хочется вернуться обратно 🥹😍🥰

ПС многие говорят про воровство на Шри, но в данном отеле мы об этом не слышали, все тихо спокойно, но свои хитрости на всякий случай мы тоже использовали","Шри ланка Thaproban pavilion waves","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r1007460367-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel is actually two hotels; Thaprobam Pavilion and Thaprobam Waves. They are connected together with one reception area and the pools and bar can be used by both sets of guests.

We stayed one night in the Pavilion and two nights at Waves. The rooms at Waves are more modern and the mattress was much more firm so I would recommend booking a room here. That said all the staff were amazing and did everything they could to accommodate our requests and look after us.

The two pools were good and we never struggled to find sun loungers.

The hotel is located a seven minute walk from the main bars and restaurants of the resort and the beach too.","Great location in Unawatuna","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r1001559362-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by warm, smiling faces at reception. A special mention to Sohani and Sandanu for their wonderful welcome – they truly set the tone for our whole stay.

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home. We stayed in the two-bedroom suite, which was perfect for our family of four. The split-level design made it feel especially spacious and luxurious.

The hotel has been tastefully designed with a serene beach vibe throughout. The main pool is absolutely stunning, offering views out to sea, and the smaller pool provided a peaceful alternative – also with beautiful views.

The location of the hotel was excellent. Just a 10–15 minute walk into town – or a quick tuk-tuk ride if you prefer – it was close enough to be convenient but far enough away to remain peaceful and relaxing.

Breakfast was generous and catered to all tastes, with both Western and Sri Lankan options. We also enjoyed lunch and dinner at the hotel – every meal was delicious and pleased both adults and kids alike.

During our stay, we went on several trips, and we’re especially grateful to Gihan for his fantastic advice on the best places to visit.

We were genuinely sad to leave the Thaproban and are already thinking about when we can return! The hotel itself is stunning but it is the staff that make it. We highly recommend staying.","A Truly Memorable Stay – We Can’t Wait to Return!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r1000983815-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

Nuwani was wonderful with him and made him feel really settled and comfortable. The lifeguards were really friendly and any questions I had, they answered with a smile.

It's in beautiful surroundings right by a nice beach,but it's so overpriced for what it offers. It's relying upon it's location.
The evening buffet is so overpriced, and the service is not great. 
No atmosphere or Sri Lankan experience feeling at all. For a genuine experience walk up the road to the Red Lobster run by a family and so authentic and reasonably priced. 
We paid quite a premium for a Deluxe Ocean View and had no sea view apart from a little bit over tall palm trees. Please don't waste your money.
When we went to settle the bill at reception it took forever. Definitely not 5* service. They definitely need to up their game. Having stayed in various hotels in Southern India which excelled,  this hotel does not live up to it's expectations.

It’s amazing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We came here to relax after a 2 week tour of Sri Lanka, and what a place to come!

It was really peaceful with fantastic amenities  great restaurants and beautiful rooms. 

What made this place truly wonderful was the amazing staff. From the moment we were welcomed into the hotel to the time we left for home, the staff went out of their way to smile, say hello, and generally make sure we were looked after.

A special shout out to the staff in the Olu restaurant. The food was so varied and incredibly delicious. The chefs are so passionate about the food being provided and it was great to learn more about the food from them. Service here was fantastic. What a great team!

We got to know some really great people at the Olu Bar. Suranda, Nipun, Kavithra and Thilina  were fantastic. It was a pleasure chatting with this team. We were really sad to say goodbye, but want to thank them for making our stay so memorable! 

We’d love to come back someday, but we will always recommend this to anyone wanting to visit this magical island.

The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. Our booking included breakfast and dinner. 
There is a heated pool although we did not try it. We did however have a round of putting on the putting green. There is also a grass tennis court.
We did a short walk from the hotel up to the sunrise and sunset view points which was easy to follow.

Outside the hotel there's a walk you can do which takes you amongst the Tea fields.
There is a pool area with sunbeds , but my one comment would be that a few more umbrellas would be useful .  we wanted to sit by the pool but unfortunately there was no room and the sunbeds on the lawn had no shade either.
The other area up on the lawn outside the restaurant has one table with four chairs and that was also occupied . I think this particular day all the guests stayed in the hotel ! So my one suggestion to the management would be to perhaps put a couple more seating areas around with tables for guests to sit in.

Have to specially mention Lishali, Faizal, Sanduni and chef Subath. The folks went above and beyond to make us feel at home.

The food was phenomenal. You know how good the food is when the your clothes gets tighter. That’s exactly what happened to us😁 On our first night we told that there is nothing they can’t get us food wise, since we were group of 11 with picky eaters and different food preferences. Boy oh boy did they true to this or what😊

Lastly this gem is situated in a 60 ache lot. Most of it paddy fields. From the moment you open the room door, you have beautiful views of the paddy fields. Plenty of walking paths to get lost in its beauty. 

They even have a great wake-up call service — a friendly peacock strolling by to greet you, like a feathered neighbor wishing you a good morning.","One for the books❤️","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r1004710377-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

Our family — Me, my wife, our 10-year-old son, 5-year-old daughter, and my wife’s parents — stayed for one night and enjoyed every moment. From the moment we arrived, we felt at home thanks to the exceptional service of our butler, Lishali, and her amazing team.

Our daughter immediately connected with the kind-hearted staff and was loved by all. The hotel team even gifted soft toys to our kids and took them on a lovely farm visit to collect fresh chicken eggs — a truly memorable experience for them.

We thoroughly enjoyed all three meals during our stay — every dish was beautifully prepared and tasted exceptional.

This time, however, we were in the mood for something a little more adventurous. Drawn by the great reviews and excellent pricing, we chose to spend three days at Jetwing Kaduruketha, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience.

Words fall short in capturing the natural beauty of this place. Surrounded by lush greenery and wildlife, the setting felt almost magical. One highlight was watching the sunset in the rain from our cozy Arachchi Villa. We also took a short trip to Ella Wala Waterfall, just 15 minutes away by car, and were blown away by the scenery.

The service was exceptional. Our young personal butler, Kavindu, was incredibly attentive and kind, making our stay comfortable. A special thanks also to Mr. Faizal, whose experience and warmth were evident in every interaction we had at the restaurant.

The food was delicious, and overall, our stay was absolutely magnificent. If I could suggest a couple of small improvements, I’d recommend providing smaller pillows and refreshing the restaurant décor for a more refined ambiance.

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience! It’s fantastic to hear that you enjoyed the environment, the activities, and the peacocks. We’re so glad you had a great time exploring the local temple, lake, and waterfall, while also finding time to meditate and have fun with Thiloka. It’s also great to know that the cookery class was such a success and that you feel confident to recreate the dishes at home. We hope you will now cook for your friend who usually always prepares meals for you back at home. If you do make any of the dishes you learnt here with us, do send some pictures as we would love to see them!

We’re especially proud of our initiative to support the local community, and we’re thrilled you had such a great time with our chef and the amazing lady from the village. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!

Combining top-notch service, an amazing view over sigiriya, beautiful and luxurious rooms and excellent food, this hotel is one of the finest destinations you can head to in sri lanka. 
As an animal lover, you have so much to discover in this beautiful facility. In addition to peacocks, geckos, monkeys, cows, bats, chipmunks, monitor lizards, and much more, one animal in particular managed to impress us. During a four hour night safari, we were able to spot very rare and shy loris.
Our guide Akash and his colleague made it possible for us, to see not only one, but in total 9 of these fascinating creatures. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.","Lori Adventure","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r1000073351-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

We were a group of 11.  Aliya Resort is a sprawling estate that provides all of your needs and wants without being intrusive.  The property has a large capacity, but you never feel overcrowded or neglected by staff.   The food is amazing - fresh and plenty of selection. Staff attentiveness is second to none - from housekeeping, spa, pool service, reception and of course the incredible waitstaff and bar staff.  I would love to name every single staff member but.  There are two standouts, which I know had their team members supporting them as well.  Supun, one of the head waiters was fun, friendly, professional and attentive.  His humour was well received by our group - along with his team in the bar.  Isuru was also a stand out.  His personal service to our small group at one of our dinners was exceptional.  He was polite, friendly and informative.  He also was supported by other staff, but the group loved him as well.  Thank you to all staff that looked after us.  Would return here to the resort in a flash.","An exceptional three nights at Aliya Resort & Spa","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r999956047-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

Everything—from the staff and ambiance to the food, service, room standards, amenities, cleanliness, and facilities—was top-notch and impeccable.
Chirath and Sashi from the front office were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Chirath ensured we were well taken care of throughout our stay. It was also wonderful to see Latha and Nirosha from the kitchen downstairs, whom we met on our previous visit, recognise us and personally come to our table to say hello and check if we were happy. Their thoughtful gesture made us feel truly valued.
All the staff were very welcoming and greeted us warmly at all times. It was also impressive to see the ladies in the garden maintaining a good rapport with guests.
However, as we traveled from Australia, we were looking forward to fresh local fruit juices, especially papaya, and watermelon, at the breakfast buffet, but unfortunately, they were not on offer.
Overall, we had a fantastic stay at Aliya and are looking forward to returning next year.","Recent stay at Aliya","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r997586521-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",

It was a great decision because the safari turned out to be one of the best trips we took in Sri Lanka. A brilliant event, organized perfectly from start to finish. A comfortable jeep, an experienced driver, a tasty lunch and, above all, a very nice guide - Mr. Akash Ukwatta (senior naturalist from the hotel), who, speaking fluent English, shared with us with passion and commitment his vast knowledge about the structure, habits and lives of the animals we encountered. His stories were great to listen to. I won't write about the wonderful landscapes and wonderful wild animals that we could observe (often from a very close distance) - you simply have to see it with your own eyes. To sum up: a great trip that I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone going on safari in Sri Lanka. The price is affordable and the quality of services is at the highest level.

Auch die Unterkünfte waren toll – gemütlich, ökologisch und mit fantastischem Blick auf die Lagune. Das Essen war ein weiteres Highlight: täglich frische und leckere Gerichte aus Sri Lanka, mit einer großen Auswahl an gesunden Optionen.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by a team that was genuinely friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with anything we needed.

The setting is truly something special. Surrounded by lush greenery and fresh mountain air, it felt like a world away from the city. The property itself sits within 100 acres of thick forest, dotted with tea and clove trees. There are plenty of nature-based activities to enjoy within the estate, and we were lucky to do a guided trek with Isuru, whose knowledge of the area’s flora and fauna was remarkable. The morning and evening trails are beautifully designed for birdwatching and immersing yourself in nature.

Waking up to the sound of birds and enjoying a cup of tea while taking in the stunning views from our room was unforgettable.

Though we only stayed for one night, we were fortunate to experience several of the property’s unique offerings, thanks to the excellent support of RM Asela and his team. The infinity pool, the peaceful setting, and the well-maintained spaces added so much charm to this hillside retreat.

Everything was clean, thoughtfully arranged, and delivered with genuine care.

Thank you as well to Udyangani, Chandima, Sathya, and Nirusha for their wonderful service.

Chaminda from Housekeeping and the rest of the team did an excellent job keeping our rooms clean and comfortable, and were always warm and welcoming.

The pool bar team were friendly and added to the laid back atmosphere by the pool, while Harindu at the lobby bar served us some excellent cocktails and snacks.

Thank you to Lakmi and the front office team for accommodating our late checkout request so kindly and efficiently.

I’d also like to thank Vindya from the engineering team, who handled our request promptly and professionally, along with support from the security team.

Finally, thank you to General Manager Johan and Resort Manager Sriyangani for ensuring everything ran smoothly and for making our stay so enjoyable.

The staff are outstanding – genuinely kind, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile. It’s clear they take great pride in making every guest feel special.

My room was clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated, with a stunning view of the ocean and lush surroundings. Waking up to that peaceful scenery was a perfect way to start each day.

Both dinner and breakfast were excellent – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The dining experience is a true highlight here.

We recently enjoyed a wonderful 3-night stay at Cinnamon Bentota Beach, and it was truly a memorable experience from start to finish. The setting is stunning, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the service throughout the hotel was excellent.

A very special mention must go to Chef Mark Selvaraj, who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. His personal attention, warm hospitality, and outstanding culinary skills truly stood out. Every meal prepared under his guidance was a delight – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. It’s rare to come across someone who is not only passionate about their craft but also genuinely cares about the guests’ experience.

Chef Mark’s thoughtful touches and willingness to cater to our preferences made us feel incredibly well looked after. He was a true highlight of our stay and left a lasting impression.

Our kids absolutely loved the large pool and kids’ club – they had a blast while we enjoyed some much-needed relaxation time.

However, I felt that the buffet could use more variety and refinement to match the hotel’s star rating and especially other Cinnamon properties. And it would be better if bathing area in room can be locked from inside when we staying with kids.

What a great hotel this is. Upon arrival we were taken to our room. We had booked the Ocean Signature suite. 
In one word, great. We have already visited many hotels. But never experienced this before. 
It felt like you had your own villa. 
Everyone can use a luxurious living room downstairs, where you can relax. 
The sound of the big waves all day long, wonderful!!
The staff also does everything for you. All so friendly. The hotel also exudes a certain tranquility. We completely recovered from a 13-day tour in Sri Lanka. 
It's just a shame that the food in the restaurant is so expensive. And especially because there is also an additional 30.5% in taxes, fees, etc. on top. Partly because of this, we hardly ate at the hotel. 
It was a holiday and hotel we will never forget.","Best hotel ever !!!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d6958701-r994925977-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

All the accommodation was lovely, but if budget will allow I would highly recommend the ocean signature suites, which have wonderful views of the ocean.

The rooms are split between4 villas and you are able to use the open air lounge  and kitchen in your villa which is a lovely touch, breakfast and dinner can also be served here , it gives you that feeling that you have your own private villa.

The beach side dining area is a real treat and I will remember that view long after my tan has faded.  Food was expensive but of a very high standard.

We can't single out any one member of staff as they were all so wonderful, always ready to help, no request to small and always with lovely smiles on their faces.  You got the impression that they enjoyed working at Sri Sharavi and they wanted us to love it as much as they did.

The location was beautiful, so photogenic, it was a real shame that the beach had disappeared and that  access to the beach either side is limited,  but reading a reply to a recent review it looks like its on its way back. That said once you get used to  it not being there and with the pool being so lovely we didn't really miss it anyway.","Wonderful Stay, Wonderful Staff, Wonderful  View, Wonderful Experience","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4481519-d6958701-r992105172-Sri_Sharavi_Beach_Villas_Spa-Kamburugamuwa_Matara_Southern_Province.html",

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Kenny, the villa manager, whose hospitality set the tone for the rest of our experience. The layout of the property is absolutely beautiful, with four stylish buildings, each housing three elegant rooms and suites, plus two additional rooms alongside a serene spa.
 
One of the standout features is the 43m infinity saltwater pool, which I believe is the largest in the area, an absolute showstopper! We couldn’t resist spending some time by the pool, soaking in the views and enjoying the tranquil atmosphere.
 
The food was equally memorable, with every dish served to perfection. The service from the team was nothing short of outstanding, friendly, attentive, and always ready with a smile.

To the beach is maybe 10 minutes walking and to the restaurants 8 minutes walking distance. In the area are plenty restaurants. 
Danu & Hursha are wonderful people so the rest of the team. Helping to organise a driver for our tours . We had Conrad. Organising massages and whatever you need.
The resort is clean and the garden is beautiful.
No complaints at all.

Location is perfect, a block inland from the main street, so very peaceful.
Staff are a true highlight, with top class service in every respect, starting with the excellent breakfast service and continued throughout the day around the pool and hotel grounds.
Breakfast is excellent, with fresh fruit and a choice of main dishes such as omlettes and scrambled eggs with toast.
Pool area is amazing with plenty of both sun and shaded loungers. 
Just 15 mins from the main international airport (CMB) so the perfect hotel to begin or end your time in Sri Lanka!
Rooms are very comfortable, with full air-conditioning, TV, tea & coffee making facilities and a hairdryer. 
Wifi network also very strong and reliable.

The breakfast is outstanding and they even made me a special breakfast of dahl curry, roti and fried eggs with coconut sambal that I wish I could eat every morning.  The fresh fruit plate that comes with breakfast is heavenly.  Most importantly, the staff make you feel like you're part of the family from the minute you arrive and throughout the whole stay.

Reading your review titled “Heaven of Trincomalee” truly brought smiles to all of us at Amaranthé Bay.
From the moment you arrived in the early hours of the morning, it was our pleasure to welcome you with warmth and care. We’re delighted that you felt looked after right from your first steps into the resort, and we’re so glad our team—from the reception welcome to the smooth check-in, refreshing drinks, and luggage assistance—made a lasting impression.

Your compliments about the fruit platter, the beautifully decorated bed, and your upgraded stay in the Junior Suite with Jacuzzi mean so much to us.

On behalf of all of us at Amaranthé Bay, thank you for spending four nights with us and for sharing such kind reflections on your family’s experience.
To be considered “the best hotel in Trinco” in your opinion is a compliment that humbles us deeply. We are delighted to know that your stay provided the perfect blend of comfort, privacy, and relaxation — just as we intend it to be. Our entire team works with great passion to create a peaceful and welcoming environment, and hearing that you found the property clean, beautiful, and quiet means so much to us.
It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed starting your mornings with our breakfast selection — our chefs will be thrilled to know their efforts made a positive impression. We're also glad you had the chance to explore the local charm with dinner by the sea — Trincomalee’s coastal setting has so much to offer, and we’re happy you were able to soak in the atmosphere both within and beyond the hotel.
Your kind mention of relaxing by the pool paints a picture of tranquility, and we’re so pleased those quiet moments brought peace to your stay. We’re especially happy to know that your room provided the space and comfort your family needed to truly unwind.
A special thank you for appreciating the service provided by our staff. It brings us so much joy to know they were able to assist you promptly and help organize your snorkeling trip to the breathtaking Pigeon Island — it’s truly one of the gems of this region, and we’re glad you got to experience its natural beauty.
Your words, “We liked it all,” and your warm recommendation mean the world to us. Welcoming families like yours is what makes our work so meaningful, and we look forward to the opportunity to host you again whenever your travels bring you back to Trincomalee.

В этом году выбрали отель Thaproban Pavilion Waves  и не ошиблись. Для Унаватуны это очень достойный уровень. 

Месторасположение: Отель красивый, расположен в живописном месте. Утопает в зелени с одной стороны и имеет прекрасный вид на океан, к сожалению не купабельный.  До пляжа 5-7 минут пешком по прямой дороге и минут 15 в обход ( попадаешь почти в центр пляжа). Зато в этот раз мы отлично изучили эту часть Унаватуны.  В пешей доступности Джангл Бич, вокруг очень много неплохих кафе.

Номер: Весь номерной фонд расположен с видом на океан, у каждого номера на 2 этаже есть балкончики ,в категории номеров Queen king size (такой был у нас) окно с балкона небольшое. Номер просторный, хорошая кровать, диванчик, телевизор, чайник и чайные принадлежности, кофе, заварка, сахар, исправно работающий кондиционер, сейф, холодильник. В ванной фен, ванные принадлежности, полотенца, шапочки для душа, мыло для рук, крем, гель для душа, шампунь, кондиционер для волос. Все с местными ароматами поэтому мы использовали свои средства. Каждый день приносили по 0,5 чистой воды на человека. Переходники для розеток нам не понадобились, все подходило. 
Уборка была каждый день, полотенца чистые в номере меняли каждый день, бельё постельное несколько раз, возможно через день. Номер в принципе был достаточно чистый, хотя все пишут что отель нуждается в косметическом ремонте. 

Завтраки: Достойные завтраки.  В сравнении с тем же Тайландом возможно скромнее,  но за 10 дней нам ничего не надоело. Дома питаемся однозначно не в таком разнообразии. Омлет, яичница, соки, выпечка в разнообразии, овощи, фрукты, сыры, сосиски, бекон, каши, местная еда, блинчики, чай, кофе. За отдельную плату можно заказать кофе из кофемашины, вполне кстати сносный. Все вкусно. Персонал внимательный. 

Развлечения: за 10 дней нашего прибывания отель устраивал 3 мероприятия, с танцами, с музыкой. Один раз выступал Life Band, в другой день был DJ. В эти дни действовала система фуршета на ужин. Мероприятия длились максимум до 11 вечера. Неплохой вариант для тех кто привязан к деткам и так далее. 

Персонал: Персонал отзывчивый, приветливый, дружелюбный, заботливый. Все просьбы выполнялись охотно. Менеджер гостиницы всегда интересуется все ли нам нравится. Каждый день с улыбкой нам выдавались пляжные полотенца. В принципе все делали для того чтоб наш отдых был отличным. 

Окружение: местоположение отеля ещё прекрасно и тем что находится слегка отдалено от шумных улочек и прогуливаясь от пляжа до отеля можно встретить павлинов, варанов, дружелюбных собак, обезьян, пальмовых белок. 

Хотим поблагодарить всю команду отеля за теплый приём. Желаем вам процветания.","Наша вторая и не последняя поездка на Шри-Ланку","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r997215613-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The location is stunning—nestled between a peaceful lagoon and the Indian Ocean, the resort offers breathtaking views and a sense of calm that’s hard to find elsewhere.

The staff were exceptional Specially Uneska —always attentive, smiling, and ready to assist with anything we needed. Check-in was seamless, and we were welcomed with a refreshing drink and a warm introduction to the property.

Our room was spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully designed with traditional Sri Lankan elements blended beautifully with modern comforts. We especially loved the private balcony overlooking the water and the open-concept bathroom with a luxurious bathtub.

Dining was a highlight of our stay. Each meal was a treat—from fresh seafood at Olu to the delicious international breakfast buffet. The chefs clearly take pride in their craft, and the variety offered meant there was something for every palate.

We also enjoyed the spa and yoga sessions, which added an extra layer of relaxation to our stay. The resort grounds are beautifully maintained, with lush gardens, a quiet beach, and tranquil pool areas perfect for unwinding.

Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, a family holiday, or simply a break from the hustle and bustle, Anantara Kalutara offers an unforgettable experience. We left feeling refreshed, pampered, and already planning our return.

Очень чуткие к желаниям гостей , хорошее настроение посетителей у них искренне в приоритете . Первый раз летели в Шри Ланку, немного опасались что не подойдет кухня так как не любим белый рис, карри и традиционную Азиатскую кухню . Но в этом прекрасном отеле была европейская кухня и так же азиатская, мы в итоге прониклись и азиатской тоже . Все было очень вкусно . Пару раз за ужином подходил шеф позвал и спрашивал что мы хотим , сказал что приготовлю что пожелаете . 
Я сама дизайнер Интерьера и могу сказать что номер в котором мы жили с очень красивым дизайном и качественным ремонтом . В номере каждый день качественно убирались , много комплиментов вроде большой фруктовой корзины , или милого набора конфеток .
 Погода так же была супер хотя нам говорили что в апреле будут дожди ,но за 2 недели дождь днем был только пару раз , быстро закончился . В общем в восторге от шри ланка, от отеля . Однозначно его всем смело рекомендуем .

Thank you for sharing your recent experience with Anantara Kalutara Resort.  It’s wonderful to hear that you appreciated the natural beauty of our setting, the attentive service from our team. That said, we’re very sorry to learn that certain aspects of your visit did not meet your expectations.  While our aim is to create comfortable and relaxing environments throughout the resort, we understand that Sri Lanka’s climate can be challenging, and your suggestions about enhancing cooling options in the bar and restaurant areas are greatly appreciated. We are actively reviewing this to explore better solutions. 

We also regret the inconvenience caused by the room’s location and the lack of orientation upon arrival.  Regarding your ocean view room upgrade, we’re truly sorry that it did not meet your expectations in terms of value or distinction. We continually strive to enhance our standards, and your feedback provides us with important insight into areas that need more attention.

We genuinely hope you left with some fond memories, despite the areas of disappointment, and we would welcome the opportunity to host you again with an experience that truly reflects the excellence we aim to deliver.

The service throughout is fantastic and having room service and drinking sundowners on the balcony to the sound of the ocean was very special.
Food at breakfast very nice with a wide variety and the best cheese we had on our whole tour .
The room servicing by Saman was very thorough.
The room and shower were both lovely and aircon and fan provided a lovely cool haven. 
However there are issues :

The room is the only place to cool down in the whole complex, even the pools are warm . The climate in SL is brutal at times and the bar ( with only one portable air conditioner) and the restaurant ( with none ) are just too hot .

Our room was a very long way away from bar/reception , it took us our whole stay to find the easiest route , we were never shown on arrival.

The cooling system in room needs tweaking. When on balcony at night if doors are open ( which they need to be to cool balcony) the room floor turns into a lethal skating rink .

On night one we had the buffet at a cost of £25 each ( and that is with allegedly 40% off ) , it was ordinary at best , and the restaurant is too warm .
There are 2 other eateries up the road , Red Lobster and Coconut Bay far superior and much cheaper 

Finally we paid over £300 for a room upgrade to a “ deluxe ocean view room “ …. the room was the same as others in our group and the ocean view was at a distance and partially obscured by trees .
There were no other added extras which on other upgrades we’ve had in e.g Costa Rica and Malaysia, disappointing","Mixed bag","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1004458328-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",

We cannot compliment the staff enough, they were all so friendly and dedicated to making our stay perfect. With each having great knowledge of the menus, information regarding the hotel and the local area. 

It didn’t matter if we were sitting in the garden with a refreshing glass of white wine, bathing in the heated swimming pool or strolling through the adjacent tea fields, every step was 5 stars.

We would like to extend a big thank you to Sanjeewa for making our stay so pleasant! And for the phone call to make sure we arrived safe in our first attempt at driving a tut tut.

Definitely a little bit of Britain so make sure you’re OK with that. The rooms are simple but have most of what you need except a fridge. Views are lovely and the main areas have a bit of the feel of your Gran’s house but clean and tidy nevertheless. All food is prepared individually and the waiting staff are friendly and don’t miss a trick.
If you are staying definitely go half board as it is about 20 minutes from Nuwara Eliya. 
They have a short hike you can do, a lovely heated but small pool and tennis and badminton court. Some previous reviews said it was in a busy area but we struggled to find any business nearby.
The only thing you need to be aware of (and it did not bother us) is that there are some lovely rooms in an annexe which is very peaceful and where we stayed. Room 208 has views to die for but is near an extractor duct from the kitchen. They do turn it off when not in use and it did not disturb our sleep. However in the early evening you can’t really have balcony doors and windows open unless you like the smell of cooking onions and garlic!","A lovely British style hotel delivered superbly by the dedicated staff.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r994262932-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The hotel impressed us with its views, interior and friendly staff. Imagine, you are having breakfast on the terrace with wide windows, behind which there is an amazingly beautiful landscape - green tea plantations, small villages, country roads. Everything is like a toy. Then you go for a walk along the road around the hills, where even more beautiful views open up. We did not have time to take photos. We wanted to capture every moment of our walk. After the walk, you swim in the pool and in front of you are heavenly meadows. There is a wonderful spa here that will allow you to completely relax and dissolve in nature.

Thanks to the hotel staff for their hospitality and help. We would like to come back here again.","Two days of paradise","2024-10","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d2165620-r986558016-Langdale_Boutique_Hotel_by_Amaya-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",

The management and the staff makes this place, they have been collected like jewels from all over the country and brought to this place. I always had a feeling of home

Mr. Leon - the boss of the bar, he healed my cold with his signature cocktails. He is so passionate about his job, that inspires to come back to the bar :))
Ms. Anne - gives such a friendly vibes to everyone! She has this talent to be blended with guests and still perform her duties on high level at the bar
Tikiri - I believe he is a local legend, because whatever is a question: kite surfing lessons, transportation, helping with accommodation - he is the one. Super patient and inspiring as an instructor, it was easy for me to improve my kiting skills with him
Sebastian, Dil, and the main man at the dining area (I forgot his name) are the guards of the place: caring of all guests, helping the team when needed and at the same time always up to chill together with guests when work is done. 

The vibes are awesome!
Even when there is no wind - there are plenty of things to do and the team cares about it: yoga, massage (god bless this guy, his hands are healing), wake boarding, games, library

Place is super clean, plenty of choices for the food (so tasty, it’s easy to gain some weight😀), artistic touch of each bungalow and common area - I felt love in every detail

But this time I took the whole family and had my son learn to kite. Their food is buffet style but always amazing  and a great variety of different dishes over the 5 days we spent. They have a range of very basic accommodation through to decent mid range bungalows and are now developing more high end options. In the summer we used to kite in the Lagoon with daily shuttles taken care of. But this time we were able to kite directly from the beach, which was amazing, and then chill out in the new beach bar. 

They have incredible staff onsite and I really cannot reccomend this place more highly. Just book early as they were fully booked for this trip.

We also had some great conversations with a pool staff member and someone from the marketing team. They shared that they had either visited Switzerland before or had family there, which made the exchange even more enjoyable.

The only downside to our stay was the experience with a young man at the reception. He gave us incorrect information regarding the full-board option and then acted as if it wasn’t a big deal.

For all these reasons we can highly recommend the tour!","Not only a tour but an exciting journey into architecture!","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r1012695222-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Pro.html",

We were taken on an evening nature walk by ....., the resident naturalist, who was very knowledgeable and informative of all the different vegetation and wildlife we came across.   A memorable experience thanks to Tashani who is a valuable asset to Simpson Forrest, always on hand to help and answer any questions on nature.

The rooms were delightful and well equipped with comfortable bed in the colonial style, leading a good nights sleep.    All the food was delicious, which coupled with the great presentation equalled  a fine dining restaurant.      The chef Ranga who came out to talk to us after the evening meal, deserves a special mention and commendation, though all the staff deserve a compliment as well but cannot recall all their names.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and cannot fault anything.    We would happily return for a longer stay.    On this tour we have stayed at a total of 8 different hotels all rated 3 or 4 Star.

I’ve always loved the A-la-carte menus than the typical buffet food and this had the best ever home made authentic Sri Lankan dishes !! More than anything the view of the hotel is just amazing as even if we sit outside the room to have morning tea or to have a dip in the pool to chill over a drink/chat or while having dinner or morning walks down the paddy fields, we were always surrounded with a beautiful calming view that cannot be just explained in just view words !! 

Most importantly I would like to mention the amazing talented and friendly staff who supported us as their hospitality, caring service and knowledge shared with us on the paddy fields were superb !! One special note to be added is on the support they gave me to hold my 4 months old baby while we enjoy our meals were truly loving and caring !! Not that the hotel has a day care as such but the generosity of the staff including Sanduni and her team were just great !! 

Special credit goes to the General Manager of the hotel; Mr. Nadhun by attending to each and every detail not only for us but for all the other guests too as the hotel was fully booked but still he ensured to communicate with all the guests as possible and make them feel comfortable. The rooms were perfectly cool even without AC, and the open washroom was the best as we chose those unique rooms !! We went for two nights but felt like staying further so I’m definitely going again ❤️","One of the best honeymoon destinations!!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g25335332-d9055459-r990066829-Jetwing_Kaduruketha-Kotikambokka_Uva_Province.html",

We booked the Wele Vidana Villa, which offered stunning views of the paddy fields and the Punagala mountain range—truly a feast for the eyes.

From the moment we made the reservation to the time we checked out, the hospitality was exceptional. A special shoutout to Shakya Manamperi, who ensured that every detail of our stay was handled perfectly. From the warm welcome with delicious raw mango juice and sweet snacks to the thoughtful arrangements, everything was impeccable. The Sara Vita session was an added delight!

The personalized butler service, led by Ayesha, was top-notch. She went above and beyond to take care of all our needs, ensuring our stay was as comfortable as possible. The entire staff deserves praise for their friendliness, attentiveness, and willingness to accommodate every request, from luggage assistance to customized experiences.

Jetwing Kaduruketha spans over 60 acres of natural beauty, with a variety of villas and options to suit every preference. The food was absolutely delicious, with generous portions and a wide range of options, including healthy village-style meals. Every meal was a treat!

The activities offered are incredible and customizable. From bird watching and trekking to an immersive village experience, there’s something for everyone. We even had the option of arranging a pool deck candlelight dinner, which is perfect for special moments.

This place is ideal for a relaxing getaway, whether you’re traveling as a couple or with family. We wholeheartedly recommend Jetwing Kaduruketha for anyone looking to unwind amidst nature with unparalleled hospitality.

Most of the hotel appearances, buildings, and surroundings were the same. But the welcome was changed. It was a remarkable welcome with their authentic and traditional condimental snacks and the welcome drinks options.  ‘Sara Bulath wita’ introduction was quite an attractive and unique factor which distinguished Kadurukeda from all other hotels.  

Dinner was Ala carte. We receive very good portion sizes from every meal. “We mostly loved ‘black pork curry’ and ‘Watalappam’. Special Thanks for ‘Nana- Faizal (Restaurant executive)’ for his tremendous explanations of food, drinks and mainly every aspect of the meal and service. Finally, the ‘Sukku Malli Coffee’ was great too after a huge diet. Cheff, your meals were great. Sorry we couldn’t talk to you.  

Nadun (GM), Thank you very much for keeping this agriculturally based hotel with organic paddy fields and all other hotel components. Special thanks for all the staff for maintaining this beautiful place with great hospitality.

Pros- amazing views, food was excellent (no buffets here but fresh made to order food), great service from Faisal in the restaurant. We appreciate that he takes time to get to know the guests and shares his life experiences too- it makes for a very personalized and enjoyable experience. The tea and French press coffee were exquisite. They have an a la carte menu but quality is top notch! Nice pool are and loungers. Cons- no A/C but there is a fan and mosquito nets; rooms are old and could use refurbishment in way of new floors and updating the furniture and bathroom. Also the rooms to the left of the dining area appear nicer with huge front balconies and nice furniture. We were in the cottages on the other side. There are no windows but areas that look like windows, have screens and bamboo blinds. The vibe here is being one with nature but I think they still need to upgrade the rooms and can maintain that theme. We very much appreciated the parting gift of black pepper to take home and use in our cooking- sweet touch! If you want the party Ella experience, this is not the place for you. This is a tranquil and scenic respite without much of a hotel vibe. I would consider returning if they updated the rooms. Also, they should get golf carts so young boys don’t have to push a wheelbarrow with heavy guest luggage- this broke my heart.","Know what you want before you book here.

The villas are beautiful - we had a signature suite overlooking the pool and beach with the most gorgeous view. It was the ideal size for a family of 4 and so comfortable. 

The beach is untouched and the best we’ve seen in Sri Lanka. The infinity pool is huge and such a lovely setting right on the beach.

Housekeeping and the grounds staff did a fantastic job of keeping everything spotless. And the waiting staff gave faultless service at breakfast, dinner and all day around the pool. Special mention to Suranga and Dimuthu who had such big smiles every day and couldn’t do enough for us during our stay. 

We were also allowed to use the facilities and shared lounge area in our villa all day before our flight, meaning we can spend our last few hours by the pool before heading back to the airport. 

We’ve been to see the turtle sanctuary, whale/dolphin watching on a catamaran, and a trip to the wonderful Galle Fort while staying here.

The hotel rooms were subdivided across four ‘villas’ that nestled along the pool, beyond which was a grassed area leading to the beach.  We were fortunate to be staying in Ocean Signature Suite overlooking the pool and sea.  

The room itself was large, light and airy, and had a wide balcony area with sun beds and table/chairs, with a delightful view over the pool and the sea (see photos).  The bathroom was also large and airy with a walk-in shower.

We ate most meals outdoors between the pool and the beach, which was superbly tranquil save for the waves crashing on to the sandy beach.  In the evenings the crabs would appear scuttling along the sand while we ate, and if you’re lucky, turtles too.

Food was excellent.

My partner had Sri Lankan rice & curry one evening which was an amazing fish curry with a selection of vegetarian dishes.

We are absolutely delighted that your stay at Amaranthe Bay in February was everything you had hoped for—and more. Your kind words truly bring a smile to our faces, as we take great pride in offering a peaceful retreat where our guests can unwind and enjoy the natural beauty of Trincomalee.
It’s fantastic to hear that you loved the serene ambiance of our landscaped gardens and the superb pool, which we’ve carefully designed to create a haven of relaxation. The Mahaweili River Estuary is indeed a breathtaking sight, and we’re so pleased that you had the chance to admire the thriving wildlife from the comfort of your mini suite. The presence of diverse bird species and fish makes it a truly special experience, and we love that you found it just as mesmerizing as we do!
We greatly appreciate your compliments on our modern fixtures and furnishings.

It was also our pleasure to arrange your excursions and assist with Tuk-Tuk rides to explore the local attractions. Trincomalee is a place of rich history and stunning natural beauty, and we love helping our guests experience all that it has to offer.
We are especially delighted that you enjoyed our Valentine’s shellfish banquet by the river. Creating magical moments for our guests is something we are passionate about, and knowing that this special evening was a highlight of your stay brings us immense joy.

I recently stayed 15 nights and enjoyed every minute.
Checked in at 19:30 and the staff took my bags to the room ‘Mango Suite’. I finally made it to my room at 01:00 because I was having a drink and talking with the staff all that time, such a warm welcome and an excellent introduction to Sri Lanka.
The rooms are spacious and clean. The garden and pool and well kept. I cannot think of a bad comment to make. The breakfast, as most people have commented on, is fabulous.
BUT….Its the staff... if you want to stay in a hotel where you are treated like gold, then this is the place to go. 
After just 4 days I posted this on my FB account:
‘I’ve stayed in Intercontinental’s, Hilton, Raddison, Marriott, Best Western along with a lot of other hotels but this has got to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in’
The feeling is just the same now, cannot wait to go back.
If any hotels want to learn how to look after guests and make them feel welcome, then visit Dickman Resort.","Amazing!","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2325134-r832760534-Dickman_Resort-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

I had chosen it rather by default, as I was not very impressed by the other hotels on offer in Negombo. 
My preference is for small, authentic-style hotels and, despite being a little put off by the name, Dickman Resort seemed to have individual charm and character – particularly the brightly coloured décor. I was not disappointed; in fact, it far exceeded my expectations!
We were warmly greeted by the courteous staff, offering freshly squeezed passion fruit juice whilst we checked-in. Flowers adorned our bed and we were supplied with a generous fruit plate and cold water in refillable glass bottles (a plus point for eco-awareness; but the staff need to remember to offer this at breakfast time, as they automatically brought me water in a plastic bottle, versus filtered in glass). The Standard ground floor room was the only one available when we booked, but it was very quiet on account of few people in the hotel, and perfect for a 24 hour stay, despite its location (it is right next to the reception area and its large windows open directly out onto the pool, so no privacy when the curtains are open). It is tastefully and colourfully decorated, albeit a little tired and quirky in parts (atrium-style shower opens out onto a scruffy rooftop). 
I enjoyed a couple of quiet refreshing swims in the pool, where the friendly pool attendant was eager to provide me with a chaise longue, towel and even a Yoga mat! I also liked the fact that there were no time restrictions, so I could have a 6 o’clock swim before breakfast.
The manager’s recommendation for dinner at a local restaurant was rather disappointing, especially as I had specifically said that I was seeking something typically Sri Lankan. It turned out to be a restaurant for tourists, complete with purple neon lighting and live English golden oldies! To be fair, the Sri Lankan food, on the extensive menu (principally international!), was rather good. In hindsight, being somewhat jet-lagged, we should have followed the manager’s suggestion to order food from the said restaurant, and dine in the hotel’s tranquil tropical garden (particularly as authentic restaurants in Negombo are few and far between – according to TA).
Breakfast at the hotel did not disappoint, being a copious fruit plate (we soon realised that this portion was the norm, reflecting Sri Lankan generosity; so we used to share one between us to avoid the carefully cut fruit being wasted). We politely declined the kind offer of eggs and bread, which we don’t eat in the mornings. Healthy options such as muesli, granola or porridge with yoghurt/coconut milk (offered by similar Sri Lankan hotels), would have been a bonus, as would good coffee versus instant – but, I was seeking authenticity in the land of tea, so you can’t have it all!
I would definitely stay at the Dickman Resort again, and I would certainly recommend it as a good temporary stopover, particularly as it is just 30 minutes from Colombo airport.","Great Stopover","2020-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2325134-r757267720-Dickman_Resort-Negombo_Western_Province.html",

I think it comes down to its “X-Factor”... This was our first trip to gorgeous Sri Lanka and the hotel organised a driver to collect us at the airport. When we arrived at the high terracotta colour walls of the hotel the electric gate opened and a uniformed security guard said hello which was nice as it was way past midnight - then, suddenly, THREE young guys hopped into view and took all our luggage while we did a rapid check-in. The complimentary passion fruit drink was divine and we were shown to our suite; they are larger than the rooms (though all rooms are nice) and we had our luggage placed down and were given a quick guided tour of it from the main bedroom area, into the bathroom and also onto the large terrace with daybed and dining table - actually very impressive as a stand-alone accommodation unit but when you factor in the hotel lobby, the hotel pool, the hotel gardens etc. then you really begin to understand all the excellent reviews.
We slept well on the HUGE bed and woke up at 7 just before breakfast at 07:30 - again, nothing was too much trouble and coffee & more passion fruit juice was whizzed to my table. The staff change shifts at 07:30 which is when the chef, “Cookie”, comes on duty and starts preparing huge platters of lovely ripe tropical fruit; it looked like a fruit-basket as there was so much but at least four of the day shift staff had now introduced themselves to me and EVERYONE wanted to offer more of something nice! Cookie came out of the kitchen and asked what we wanted for breakfast so I had omelettes with bacon and it came with homemade bread and coconut dal. My partner joined me and more pampering fuss was then made of him; when you are in a new country you can often feel cautious or disoriented but Dickman’s staff are simply wonderful - we barely left the hotel whilst we were there for three days/nights as, with the beautiful pool, wooden sun loungers and the attentive service, the time simply flew by.
I have already emailed to discuss returning again next year as our experience was like that of VIPs in a First Class cabin on a large aeroplane - nothing was ignored or forgotten and we felt so special and so happy for the full 72 hours of our stay.
*I’d like to say extra-special thanks (again) to Cookie & Akila for their unfaltering service and time, and to Damth & Treshan for managing such a great hotel environment- a class act and one that we’re keen to revisit in the near future.

The location of the hotel is incredible as it is set right on the beach with breathtaking sea views and perfect for sunset strolls. It also has a lovely pool which is great for swimming and sunbathing if the beach isn’t for you. 

The hotel is very close to close to Galle Fort by Tuk Tuk so you can easily go there as it has great restaurants. It is also located close to Weligama beach (great for surfing), and Mirissa (good shopping and beach). 

We stayed in an Ocean Suite and a Penthouse Suite and both the rooms were fantastic. They were extremely comfortable, immaculately clean, beautifully designed and decorated and we were completely spoilt with cleaning everyday by the housekeeping team as well as an evening tuck down service. 

The staff are all exceptional. They were always very observant, friendly and went out of their way to make our time comfortable and relaxing. Particular shoutouts to Kasun who was extremely attentive and helpful when we were lying by the pool. As well as Mudali who made the best cocktails and was great fun to talk to. The breakfast staff were also wonderful, and everyone is an utter credit to the hotel! 

We can’t recommend Sri Lanka as a holiday destination and especially this hotel enough. And we will definitely return again one day.

The hotel is everything the other reviews say but, we were particularly fortunate to have the place virtually to ourselves. The staff, without exception, couldn't have been more helpful and had that nice balance of being there if you needed but not overly solicitous. Stand out man is Kasun the pool guy; always happy, helpful and meticulous in his attention to detail, from trimming the lawn with scissors to topping up the drinking water just when you needed it. The food is of a very high standard with a nice mixture of Sri Lankan and western options on the menu. We were treated to dinner on night overlooking the beach and had a whole local fish with all the accompaniments and all for less than $30 each.

We were so happy we found KK Beach Hotel.  From the moment we arrived, we were met with smiling faces.  The manager and staff were always attentive, kind and willing to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying our time.  The restaurant staff, housekeeping and gardener were always welcoming to my friend and I.  We had purchased some fruits from a market and the manager happily assisted us in cleaning and preparing it for us.  The restaurant staff always helped us it our requests and were always happy to prepare our fruits for us.  We were so thankful for the kindness.  Also, the gardener went above and beyond his way to make the beachfront accessible for my friend and her leg injury.  He filled and carried heavy sandbags to create lower steps onto the sand.  He also helped us prepare our daily lounge chairs closer to the beachfront to enjoy the beautiful views.  Everyone was willing to help us or assist us in anyway.  We really appreciated all of the staff and their kindness.  It was a wonderful welcome for us in Sri Lanka.  The kitchen staff also made my friend a special requested meal of a
Seafood fried rice which she loved so much.  In terms of our accommodation, we loved the large and spacious suite.  We had ample storage for our luggage.  Lots of shelves, wide space to walk, separate bedroom to TV sitting room.  The bed was also very comfortable for us.  The view was fantastic.  We were able to lookout at the beautiful beach.

We stayed in two double rooms which were very comfortable and en-suite. There are also a range of suites available. 
The hotels position is excellent being virtually on the beach and about 30 minutes from Galle. The facilities are very good with the lounge/ bar area and restaurant  opening out on to the  pool area which in turn  provides access to the beach. The only issue I found was getting down the steps to the beach but it was only an issue because I have false hips.
The service provided by staff is second to non. They go the extra mile to make guests stay as pleasant as possible. Literally nothing is too much trouble. It would seem unfair to mention individuals because each staff member that we encountered were superb. From the chap who looks after the pool and grounds keeping guests hydrated whilst they take the sun, right across the team. I  think this is because managers lead by example. The Food is also excellent providing both a set menu which changes frequently and a la carte.

Without doubt it was one of most enjoyable and relaxing breaks we've ever had. 
The hotel is beautiful. The decor and furnishing are magnificent. The wonderful colours of the sea, the beach and the hotel gardens, pool and umbrellas all create a gorgeous setting.
Our room was on the top floor with wonderful views of the beach and the sea. The room had lots of light and space and was infused with the most wonderful scents from cinnamon oils.
The hotel food was superb, we enjoyed breakfasts especially the egg hoppers. Dinner was also fabulous with a great choice each night from a set menu along with an a la carte menu.
We ate at KK Beach's sister hotel, Kahanda Kanda one evening, I would definitely recommend this. We were also given a mini tour of the villas and would consider spending a night or two there in future.

A special mention must go the hotel staff all of whom were very welcoming and reflect the quality of both hotels. Kasun was especially helpful with useful information and in showing us the beach area. He also ensured that we always had cold water to drink on our lazy afternoons by the pool.
We plan to return and would recommend this hotel as a great place to relax and enjoy the Galle area.","A perfect place to relax.","2024-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r957041737-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

However the architecture and sound of the sea meant that we did not have any problems with road noise. It is a beautiful boutique hotel, very well run and well maintained. The room that we were in was not one of the suites but was gorgeous, great size, really well designed and an enormous comfy bed. AC worked really well and the en suite shower room is really trendy. The staff are all wonderful and attentive, we felt like visiting film stars. I would highly recommend this hotel.
We also chose to take up the complementary Tuk Tuk offer to visit their sister hotel The Kahanda Kanda (approx 7km away) for a meal on our second night. An equally beautifully designed boutique hotel in the middle of the countryside. Again we were treated like visiting film stars. The location is very peaceful and immersed in nature. Beautiful gardens and pool. We would certainly also recommend a stay at this hotel. The meal was also really good quality and good value.","Paradise by the sea","2024-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2104878-d10522102-r952836928-KK_Beach-Habaraduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The staff at the hotel could not have been more accommodating if they tried, nothing was too much to ask and they were always there to help. I don’t normally do trip advisor reviews but felt compelled to following our stay here as all the staff and the owner, George, deserve the praise.

Days by the pool were serene, with Kasun looking after guests. He provided 100 percent attention, smiles, and care, making us feel totally relaxed and well looked after. Lovely cocktails were served by the barman. The entire staff was friendly and caring. We enjoyed a full seafood platter on our balcony, which offered an amazing view of the ocean. The platter was well organized by Pathum, the head of food and beverage, who also served as an administrator. He was very helpful during our stay, ensuring our holiday was spotless . During swim in the ocean where currents can be strong Kasun made sure we are safe and guided us through it . We stayed in penthouse where rooms are big and spacious .

Just five minutes in a tuk tuk from the beaches, run by a friendly, helpful Englishman, Asian Gem is a small, peaceful getaway from the party vibe of the Hikkaduwa beaches.
There's a lovely swimming pool to relax in or by, gorgeous terraces with loungers surrounding and an out door restaurant area, all over looking the spectacular surrounding lagoons and tropical  jungle.
The food is spectacular and s far cry from the samyness of much of the beachfront grub - fancy a cracking steak, grab one here!
The place is full of nice little unique touches in the decor, the staff are friendly, attentive and very well trained by Dale, the owner.
I only got to see one of the rooms, as it was, unsurprisingly, fully booked on the dates I was there, bit it was exactly what you'd expect from a hotel calling itself 'boutique': sparklingly clean and tastefully luxurious with incredible views over the jungle and lagoons.
Can't wait to stay here next time I visit Hikka...

Extremely helpful and polite host even offered us to use their swimming pool and showed oldie music box. Fantastic variety of flavors, balance of spices and outstanding service. Special attention to every customer’s taste. This is a place for food gourmets! We really recommend this restaurant for everyone who wants to try local food in the highest level.

The hotel is tucked away down a bumpy little backroad, but dont let that put you off, because once your through the gates you can start to relax. Check in was quick and easy and we were shown to our room which was large and airy and overlooked a beautiful nature reserve lake. The rooms are simply furnished but cover all your basic needs, fridge aircon, tv safe. There was shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in big ceramic dispensers which was a nice eco change from all the little plastic bottles. The rooms were always kept nice and clean and towels,sheets replaced at your wishes. The pool is wonderful and we spent lots of time there, it was so quiet and relaxing and they give you a bell to ring should you require anything.
The food was excellent, we ate there every night, sri lankan curry, fish and chips, stroganoff, steak, noodles, you name it, each one was spot on.
The staff were always friendly, helpful and accomodating, always happy to help organise trips etc.
If i had to give a negative our bathroom got very hot at night, but we just kept the door shut and the aircon on.
I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this to anyone and thanks again Asian Jewel for a great time.","Peaceful relaxing stay","2020-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d1009523-r749232725-Asian_Jewel_Boutique_Hotel-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",

The hotel also has the best restaurant in Hikkaduwa where you eat breakfast. It also has an extensive lunch and dinner menu. 

The rooms themselves are very comfortable. Each room has air conditioning and a very effective ceiling fan. Plenty of wardrobe space, a free safe and a good amount of power sockets/USB sockets. There is also a great balcony to enjoy a drink in the sun or a nightcap on an evening.

The pool area is kept immaculately and there is always a sun bed and umbrella available when you need one.

We've tried most hotels in the area. And this was our second visit to this property. 

Highlights of the property - it's a very large and beautiful property designed by the famous architect Gefforey Bawa. There are also some lovely pieces of art forming part of the interior design. It is a also situated in a unique location with the sea on one side and the Bentara river on the other side. 

There are two wings. We've stayed in both. One wing is a little far away from the restaurants, reception, gym, kids play area etc. We booked a terrace room and were later upgraded to a luxury sea front room. But we could barely see the sea from our room in the first floor (didn't mind though since this was a free upgrade). This is because there is actually a small lane and a tree cover between the property and the public beach. The second floor probably gives better views. But the room was lovely! It was very spacious with a large balcony as well and had all the luxuries. 

They have a sizeable pool. The beach is public (You have to a cross a small lane to get to the beach) but clean. And the hotel does provide some beach chairs and umbrellas. 

They have a fabulous breakfast with a massive spread!!!! (It was actually the highlight of the visit 😉) For lunch, we went a la carte at their sea food restaurant. If I recall correctly, the extensive sea food menu was aviable only for dinner but they had their normal menu and what we got was quite exceptional. 

The dinner was not as fabulous as breakfast (especially the salads and desserts) but still quite good. One pet peeve was that the main restaurant had only a small area which was air conditioned. The rest of the area didn't even have fans. It was extremely humid the day we visited and coupled with the heat from all the cooking, we were sweating buckets, so much so that we kept an alarm on our second day and came very early for breakfast to get a spot in the air-conditioned section. 😀

Both breakfast and dinner had an extensive spread of local, Indian, East Asian and Western dishes. The staff weren't particularly friendly but were quite efficient except for a minor hassel related to our booking.

All in all, highly recommended if you are just looking to laze around (i.e. eat, sleep, swim) in comfort. [P.s they do offer painting classes, yoga, third party managed excursions in the river if you are looking for more energetic options.]","Ideal getaway","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r1009267396-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Pro.html",

The pools are lovely, and the pool bar is cool. The team there is friendly, attentive, and they even remembered our previous orders, which made us feel genuinely welcomed.
The buffet for both breakfast and dinner were excellent, offering a wide variety of tasty dishes with something for everyone. The setting, overlooking the lake, made the dining experience even more enjoyable. The selection covers most cuisines, so there's always something new and delicious to try.

The tuktuk ride up from Kandy station was up a steep, winding road, an adventure in itself.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  They upgraded me to a luxurious room in the bungalow, extremely peaceful with only the sound of birdsong for company.  Just across the lawn, the infinity pool provided wonderful sunsets.  And being 1,300 metres up, the climate was fresher than on the coast. 

The restaurant served excellent food, usually on a buffet basis.  Curry for breakfast every day!  On one afternoon they organised a nature trail, about an hour and a half around woodland and tea plantations.

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","We stayed two nights at Simpson’s as part of a touring holiday and felt very fortunate that we had been booked in there. I was sorry to leave. Our room (106) was well-appointed. Most importantly the bed and pillows were very comfortable, so we had a good sleep and woke refreshed for the sightseeing day ahead. One of my tests for a good hotel is the sleeping comfort. 
The infinity pool is in an elevated location, reached by 5 min walk up a steepish driveway. We managed fine, despite creaky joints, but there is a golf buggy service if you want. The view from the pool area across to distant hills is gorgeous. Don’t miss the sunsets up there.
All the staff, be they Reception, housekeeping, pool service or restaurant were genuinely kind and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. 
There was a wide range of good quality food at the restaurant. We ate à la carte one night and it was lovely to be served at the table. Most tables are inside with panoramic window views. There are a few on the terrace outside, we reserved one on our second night as al fresco dining is part of our holiday enjoyment. The twinkling fireflies in the trees were an added bonus. 
We had early starts on our sightseeing programme and the hotel willingly opened the breakfast service early for our convenience. 
I would like to close with a mention of the restaurant team members who all were so efficient and professional. It would be unfair to mention just one name. They were a great team. I hope I will be forgiven for any misspelling- Wasantha, Prabudda, Chamara and Namal. I would certainly go back to Simpson’s.","A little piece of Heaven","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4297383-d14986007-r992605812-Simpson_s_Forest_Luxury_Boutique_Resort_Spa-Wattegama_Kandy_District_Central_P.html",

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We appreciate your honesty and understand that your experience didn’t quite match up with your expectations based on other reviews. It’s great to hear that the location near the pool and gym worked well for you, and we appreciate your perspective on the food.

Just to highlight, we do offer an à la carte menu for guests who prefer a wider variety of dishes. Additionally, for those looking to enjoy a more authentic Sri Lankan experience, we’re happy to serve traditional Sri Lankan rice and curry upon request.

We also noticed that you may have missed our nature trekking experience, which is a unique opportunity to explore the beautiful surroundings and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of the area. We think it’s one of the highlights of staying with us, and we'd love for future guests to give it a try.

We’re sorry to hear that the food didn’t fully meet your expectations, and we’ll continue to work on improving our offerings. Thanks again for your feedback.

For us it was OK.  Our upgraded room was OK, nothing special, a wee bit old and tired, the upside is we were right by the pool and gym, which if you are in the main hotel was a bit of an uphill hike.

The food was a buffet, you could order from the menu, but that was mostly western and most of the side dishes were lifted straight from the buffet.  The food available was a mish mash of roast chicken, vegetables, pasta, salads and a small cooking section that offered some fried fish or meat, neither of these were anything special.  There was a lot to go at, but all was a bit meh.

I fully accept I’m out of step here with the other reviews, but I am only saying as we saw it, we had much better food and room in our £30 home stay called Shay Mango, visit them if you want a true Sri Lankan experience with amazing food and accommodation.","It was OK, just","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g4297383-d14986007-r991932136-Simpson_s_Forest_Luxury_Boutique_Resort_Spa-Wattegama_Kandy_District_Central_P.html",

As you booked through a travel agent, and we had no direct contact before your arrival, our manager was very pleased to be able to welcome you and introduce you to all that Sri Sharavi has to offer as a small boutique property where the level of personalised service, and our quiet location, make a difference when compared to bigger properties. 

We pride ourselves on our a la carte menu - which means that each meal is prepared freshly and to order, and it also eliminates unnecessary food waste.

Our pool is a saltwater pool - water from the ocean is pumped into the system, and then fresh water is used to stabilise it. This is a specialised process to ensure that the water is clean and enjoyable for everyone. A saltwater pool is different than swimming in the sea, and also much more pleasant than swimming in a pool filled with harsh chlorine and chemicals. 

Thank you and safe travels

The studio room, boasting exceptional views of the beach and ocean, was nothing short of amazing. The hotel's facilities, from the amenities to the ambiance, were of high quality, enhancing our overall experience.

While the food was undeniably delicious, some dishes leaned towards the pricier side compared to other spots in Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, the culinary offerings, including some of our favorites, contributed positively to our stay. The strategic location near Galle made it easily accessible, providing the option for a convenient meal out.

A substantial shout-out is due to the staff and management, particularly Pathum, Kasuntha, and Nipuna (and many others whose names we did not write down). 

However, the real star of our KK Beach experience was Kasun, whose attentive and enthusiastic care truly stood out. He seemed to anticipate our needs, ensuring we never had to ask for more water or a towel – a level of service that made our stay exceptionally comfortable.

In gratitude to the entire team at KK Beach, we extend a big thank you for making our stay so special. Their collective efforts, and particularly Kasun's, left an indelible mark on our experience.

Once again the hotel lived up to all our expectations.  You will love it as well if you like the following:

A small hotel, reasonably priced, with a personal touch where you are truly spoilt.
A peaceful environment, with plenty of birdlife, etc.
A small, clean, pool which you often have to yourselves.
Comfortable sunbeds, set up to your liking. Drinks and food served to your sunbed if you wish.
Next to a lagoon, five minutes from the beach by tuktuk at a cost of £1
Good food, both western and Sri Lankan. Chosen from a menu and served to your table.
Friendly staff who cannot do enough for guests.

Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, with friendly people, beautiful beaches, incredible history and spectacular wildlife. VISIT!!!

We took a tuk tuk from the main street and 10 mins later we arrived. We didn’t want to sit at the side of the river due to the bugs but its not a problem if you don’t mind the odd bug. We has Sri Lanka boneless chicken curry, battered prawns (amazing!) and the cottage pie ( a little home comfort : ) we must say this was the best meal we had in Sri Lanka as too many places cater for ‘westerners’ serving toasties, burgers, crispy chicken etc. We didn’t travel all that way to not eat their food but this place made the best curry of our whole trip. It did take a while to come but it has a nice chilled atmosphere. Sorry no photos but please try this place out!

This is quieter and very beautiful. The hotel has a lovely garden and pool, breakfast and meals are served on a veranda which is very nice. A very good breakfast and dinner menu. Excellent food, we had a Sri Lankan curry one evening very well presented, tasty and excellent value.  The downside for our stay was the bed mattresses were so hard that we couldn’t sleep and our joints and backs hurt, there were no mattress toppers and the blanket put under the sheet did little to help. A mattress topper would be really good for people who would like/need a softer mattress.
